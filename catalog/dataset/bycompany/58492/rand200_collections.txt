58492_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P1_S4	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, energy costs and interest rates.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P1_S5	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our products.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We serve customers in a variety of industries, some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand due to a weak global economy.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	A sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could adversely impact our sales, net earnings, financial condition, cash flow and liquidity.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	PART I Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs move with the market.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Also, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Steel is our most significant raw material.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S6	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S7	This has primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S8	This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S9	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S11	Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P7_S12	Asian and European competition could adversely affect our operating results.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S5	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S6	At December 31, 2010, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $1.08 billion, or approximately 36% of our total assets.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P8_S7	In addition, net property, plant and equipment, sundry assets and non-current assets held for sale totaled approximately $700 million, or approximately 23% of total assets.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2010 indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	At December 31, 2010, goodwill associated with reporting units whose fair values exceeded the carrying value by 10-25% was approximately $190 million; and $740 million of goodwill was associated with reporting units that had fair values in excess of the carrying values by greater than 25%.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	For the year ended 2010, other long-lived asset impairments were $2.4 million, of which $1.5 million was recognized in continuing operations.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P9_S6	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In 2010, 28% of our sales from continuing operations were generated by international operations.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_11_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	and administrative facilities associated with continuing operations, of which 157 were located across the United States and 65 were located in foreign countries.
58492_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	Includes some multi-purpose facilities with additional warehouse, sales and/or administrative uses.
58492_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Facilities that we own produced approximately 70% of our sales from continuing operations in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	We also lease many of our production, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_11_ITEM2_P1_S3	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 102 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	In the opinion of management the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_11_ITEM2_P2_S3	We face decisions about further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that eventually market demand will improve.
58492_11_ITEM2_P2_S4	With our currently low utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate that demand improvement up to approximately $4 billion in revenue (assuming current sales mix).
58492_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	The information in Note T on page 121 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.
58492_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	The following information is included in accordance with the provisions of Part III, Item 10 of Form 10-K and Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.

58492_11_ITEM2_P15_S1	It does not include shares withheld for taxes in net option exercises and net stock unit conversions during the quarter.
58492_11_ITEM2_P16_S0	(2) On August 4, 2004, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year beginning January 1, 2005.

58492_11_ITEM2_P16_S2	As such, effective January 1, 2011, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2011.
58492_11_ITEM2_P17_S0	Sale of Unregistered Shares of Common Stock The Company issued 6,000 shares of common stock for $120,310 (at fair market value) to David S. Haffner, President and Chief Executive Officer in the fourth quarter of 2010 as set out below.

58492_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	As discussed in Notes C and D beginning on pages 86 and 90 respectively, the Company incurred asset impairment and restructuring-related charges totaling $84 million in 2008.
58492_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	Of these charges, approximately $33 million were associated with continuing operations and $51 million related to discontinued operations.
58492_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	As discussed in Notes C and D beginning on pages 86 and 90 respectively, the Company incurred asset impairment and restructuring-related charges totaling $305 million in 2007.
58492_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	Of these charges, approximately $159 million were associated with continuing operations and $146 million related to discontinued operations.
58492_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	Amounts for 2006 through 2008 were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of noncontrolling interests from Other expense (income), net to (Earnings) attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	Demand improved in many of our markets during 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong.
58492_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger-ticket items slowed.
58492_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	Improved market demand led to higher sales and earnings in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P0_S5	Activities completed over the past few years (including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins, and other cost reduction initiatives) improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from the higher volume.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	During 2010, we completed the sale of the seventh, and final divestiture identified as a part of our strategic realignment.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	The seven divestitures collectively generated $433 million of after-tax cash proceeds (over the past three years), exceeding our original $400 million goal.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Operating cash for the full year significantly exceeded the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our focus on return optimization was reflected in part through the low level of working capital that was maintained as sales began to recover.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	In August, we raised the quarterly dividend to $.27 per share and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases at a 14% compound annual growth rate.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	We also repurchased over 6 million shares of our stock during 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S6	We ended 2010 with net debt to net capital well below our long-term targeted range, no significant fixed term debt maturing until 2013, and over $500 million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S7	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR), on a rolling three-year basis, to that of peer companies.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S8	We target TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long-term, which we believe will require average TSR of 12-15% per year.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S9	For the three years ended December 31, 2010, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, which places us in the top 8% of the S P 500.
58492_11_ITEM7_P1_S10	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	INTRODUCTION What We Do Leggett Platt is a diversified manufacturer, and member of the S P 500 index, that conceives, designs, and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in most homes, offices, and automobiles, and many retail stores.
58492_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	We make components that are often hidden within, but integral to, our customers products.
58492_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	We are the leading U.S. manufacturer of: components for residential furniture and bedding, power foundations, carpet underlay, components for office furniture, drawn steel wire, automotive seat support and lumbar systems, and bedding industry machinery.
58492_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Our Segments Our continuing operations are composed of 19 business units in four segments, with approximately 19,000 employees and 140 production facilities located in 18 countries around the world.
58492_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	This segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We also sell carpet cushion, power foundations, bed frames, ornamental beds, and geo components.
58492_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Commercial Fixturing Components Operations in this segment manufacture and sell store fixtures and point-of-purchase displays used in retail stores.
58492_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	We also produce chair controls, bases, and other components for office furniture manufacturers, as well as select lines of private-label finished furniture.
58492_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	PART II Industrial Materials These operations primarily supply steel rod, drawn steel wire, steel billets, and welded steel tubing to other Leggett operations and to external customers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our customers use this wire and tubing to make bedding, furniture, automotive seats, mechanical springs, and many other end products.
58492_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	We also supply fabricated wire products, such as shaped wire for automotive and medical supply application; tying heads, boxed wire, and parts for automatic baling equipment; coated wire products, including dishwasher racks, and wire retail fixtures and point-of-purchase displays.
58492_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Specialized Products From this segment we supply lumbar support systems and seat suspension systems used by automotive seating manufacturers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We manufacture and install the racks, shelving and cabinets used to outfit fleets of service vans.
58492_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	We also produce quilting, sewing, and wire forming machinery, some of which is used by other Leggett operations as well as external customers, including bedding manufacturers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Discontinued Operations and Divestitures During the past three years, we divested seven businesses (approximately 15% of our portfolio) that we identified as a part of the strategic realignment announced in late 2007 (discussed below).
58492_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	In 2008, we sold our Aluminum Products segment and four smaller business units (Wood Products, Fibers, Plastics, and the dealer portion of Commercial Vehicle Products).
58492_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	In 2009, we sold the Coated Fabrics business unit, and in 2010 we divested the Storage Products business unit.
58492_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	We received after-tax cash proceeds of $433 million for these seven businesses, exceeding our original estimate of approximately $400 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	Results of operations for all of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	For more information about discontinued operations and the divestitures, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	In late 2007, we outlined significant changes to the Company s strategy.
58492_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We adopted a new primary financial metric (Total Shareholder Return), adopted role-based portfolio management, implemented more rigorous strategic planning, and changed the priorities for use of cash.
58492_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	Our goals, in sequential order, were to i) divest low performing businesses, ii) return more cash to investors, iii) improve margins and returns, and iv) begin to carefully and conservatively grow the company at 4-5% of annual revenue.
58492_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	We have made significant progress over the past three years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	The divestitures were largely complete by the end of 2008; margins and returns have improved; and we have returned much of our excess cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases.
58492_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	Our focus now is two-part: i) continue improving margins, and ii) begin laying the groundwork for long-term 4-5% growth.
58492_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is the key financial measure that we use to monitor performance.
58492_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price].
58492_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	In 2008, dividends and stock buybacks largely drove our TSR; during 2009, we benefited significantly from margin improvement; and in 2010, revenue growth (from improved market demand) boosted TSR.
58492_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Beginning in 2008, we introduced TSR-based incentives (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of 320 peers) for senior executives and we modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control.
58492_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We monitor our TSR performance, relative to the S P 500, on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	For the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, our TSR performance placed us within the top 8% of the S P 500 companies.
58492_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	So far, for the first two years of the next three-year measurement period (which will end on December 31, 2011), our TSR performance ranks slightly above the midpoint (but not among the top one-third) of the companies in the S P 500.
58492_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest).
58492_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as EBITDA growth, operating cash flows, and return on assets.
58492_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_11_ITEM7_P12_S4	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The majority of our business units are categorized as Core .
58492_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	A smaller percentage are categorized as Grow consequently, we recognize as a strategic imperative the need to expand the Grow category by improving i) our success rate at developing innovative new products and ii) our abilities to identify new growth platforms.
58492_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	A few small business units are considered Fix , and must improve their performance within a reasonable time frame.
58492_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Finally, a few small business units (or portions of business units) are considered non-strategic, and may be divested as the M A market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices.
58492_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually.
58492_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2%-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us, and in which Leggett would possess a competitive advantage.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	These growth efforts are receiving significant management attention and priority, and we are making progress in both areas.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	We have had success this past year, with new products introduced in our office components, automotive, and home furniture components businesses.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	Though individually those were modest successes, collectively they added to 2010 s sales and earnings growth.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	In addition, we have instituted some of the processes that need to be in place to identify new market opportunities.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S6	Successful development of new growth platforms will take time; we do not anticipate significant contributions from these activities in the near term.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S7	The strategic changes have increased available cash.
58492_11_ITEM7_P16_S8	We expect to continue returning much of this cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
58492_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	PART II Customers We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing 6% of our sales.
58492_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Major Factors That Impact Our Business Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Market Demand Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	All these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Demand improved in many of our markets during 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger-ticket items slowed.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	Improved market demand led to higher sales and earnings in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	Activities completed over the past few years (including the divestiture of businesses under our strategic plan, closure of certain underperforming and underutilized facilities, elimination of sales with unacceptable margins, and other cost reduction initiatives) improved our cost position and enabled earnings to benefit notably from higher sales.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S6	Capacity utilization levels in the majority of our operations remain low.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S7	We face decisions about possible further facility consolidation but have chosen to retain excess capacity because we believe that market demand will continue to improve.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S8	Our current productive capacity should readily accommodate sales of approximately $4 billion (assuming current sales mix), or levels roughly 20% higher than those of 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P19_S9	Until our productive capacity is fully utilized, each additional $100 million of sales (from incremental unit volume) should generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.
58492_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Raw Material Costs In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	This purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have.
58492_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Purchasing arrangements vary across the company.
58492_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	However, when commodities experience extreme inflation, vendors do not always honor those contracts.
58492_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.
58492_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	Steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_11_ITEM7_P23_S5	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Significant steel cost increases in 2008 were followed by significant cost decreases in 2009 as global economies weakened.
58492_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	In both cases, we generally adjusted pricing to our customers to reflect the changes in commodity costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	In late 2009 and early 2010, steel costs increased, and again we implemented price increases to recover the majority of the higher costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	By the end of 2010, we were facing further inflation in steel costs, and announced and began implementing additional price increases in early 2011.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	As a result, metal margins within the steel industry (and in our rod producing operation) were lower during 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	We anticipate further compression in these margins in early 2011 as scrap costs have increased again in recent months.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S6	In late 2010 these costs increased, and in early 2011 we announced and began implementing price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S7	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S8	We experienced this de-contenting effect in our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials segments in recent years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S9	As our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address steel and chemical inflation, our profit margins were negatively impacted.
58492_11_ITEM7_P25_S10	We are responding by developing new products (including new types of mattress innersprings, boxsprings, and reclining chair mechanisms) that enable our customers to reduce their total costs, and in certain instances, provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Competition Many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	and product innovation, higher quality products, extensive customer service capabilities, and financial strength.
58492_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering product quality, innovation, and customer service.
58492_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_11_ITEM7_P27_S4	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P27_S5	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters.
58492_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	In instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas, our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently.
58492_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	We currently operate 10 facilities in China.
58492_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam.
58492_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	We saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began.
58492_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved.
58492_11_ITEM7_P29_S3	The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P29_S4	The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014.
58492_11_ITEM7_P29_S5	Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin.
58492_11_ITEM7_P29_S6	Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	We experienced a temporary loss of market share during the last half of 2010 as certain of our customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from European suppliers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted from a combination of factors that benefited European suppliers in the early summer: i) the weaker Euro; ii) temporarily lower wire costs; and iii) greater excess capacity as a result of economic turmoil in Europe.
58492_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Because of the slowing of consumer demand for mattresses in the last half of 2010, it took longer for these imported products to be consumed, but by year-end, we had regained the majority of the lost volume.
58492_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 vs. 2009 During 2010, sales from continuing operations increased 10%, reflecting improved market demand in several of our businesses.
58492_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Full-year earnings from continuing operations also increased, from $121 million in 2009 to $184 million in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	Further details about our consolidated and segment results from continuing operations are discussed below.
58492_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2010, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	In 2010, sales from continuing operations increased 10% versus 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	Demand improved in many of our end markets during the year.
58492_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong.
58492_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger-ticket items slowed.
58492_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	PART II Full-year earnings from continuing operations increased in 2010, primarily reflecting higher unit volumes, a lower effective tax rate, and the non-recurrence of three significant expense items from 2009 (detailed in the table above).
58492_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	These earnings improvements were partially offset by lower metal margins.
58492_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	As a result, metal margins within the steel industry (and in our rod producing operation) were lower during 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Impact All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	We experienced a large swing in the LIFO impact during the past two years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	In 2009, significant steel cost decreases resulted in a LIFO benefit of $67 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	In 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense of $15 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	The LIFO impact recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each year by FIFO impacts at the segment level.
58492_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Segment-level earnings in 2009 were significantly burdened (primarily in the first half of the year) as we consumed higher cost steel while selling prices decreased.
58492_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	In 2010, segment-level earnings benefitted under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P39_S2	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Interest and Income Taxes Net interest expense was roughly flat with 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for 2010 was lower, at 28.1%, versus 39.0% in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	In 2010, the tax rate benefitted from the higher level of earnings, changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, and tentative settlements of tax examinations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	During the year, we reached tentative agreement with the IRS on their examination of certain tax credit claims, and recognized tax benefits of $5 million associated with those claims.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S4	These benefits were partially offset by incremental taxes resulting from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S5	During 2010, we repatriated $108 million of foreign earnings, which resulted in a net tax charge of $5 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S6	In 2009, the higher tax rate reflected unfavorable tax adjustments resulting from Mexican tax law changes, which caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction.
58492_11_ITEM7_P40_S7	As a result, we recorded a $6 million tax charge to earnings related to 2009 and prior year losses that might expire before they could be utilized to reduce taxable earnings.
58492_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	In the following section we discuss 2010 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from continuing operations for each of our segments.
58492_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 94.
58492_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Residential Furnishings Residential Furnishings sales increased in 2010, primarily due to market share gains in our furniture components business.
58492_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	Demand in most of our residential markets was relatively strong during the first half of the year but weakened noticeably in the last half as consumer demand for large ticket items (such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture) slowed.
58492_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus 2009, with the earnings impact from higher unit volumes augmented by pricing discipline, significantly reduced bad debt expense, and a benefit associated with the sale of a building.
58492_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	Commercial Fixturing Components Sales increased in 2010 due to relatively strong demand in our Store Fixtures business by value-oriented retailers, and improved market demand in Office Furniture Components.
58492_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	EBIT and EBIT margins also increased versus the prior year, largely due to higher sales.
58492_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	2010 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and improved market demand.
58492_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2009, as higher sales were more than offset by lower metal margins within the steel industry.
58492_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Sales increased in 2010, reflecting improved demand across all the major businesses in the segment.
58492_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales bolstered by cost reductions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Results from Discontinued Operations Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $5 million, from a loss of $6 million in 2009 to a loss of $1 million in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P44_S3	This earnings increase was primarily due to the non-recurrence of $3 million (net of tax) of environmental charges related to an aluminum property and lower long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges associated with the divestitures (which are now complete).
58492_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2009 vs. 2008 During 2009, sales from continuing operations decreased 25%, reflecting a combination of weak market demand, steel-related price deflation, and our decision to exit some specific sales with unacceptable margins.
58492_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	In the majority of our global markets, demand stabilized at low levels in early 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	Despite the significant sales decline, full-year earnings from continuing operations decreased only modestly, from $128 million in 2008 to $121 million in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P45_S3	Cost structure improvements and pricing discipline offset nearly all the impact from lower sales.
58492_11_ITEM7_P45_S4	Further details about our consolidated and segment results from continuing operations are discussed below.
58492_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2009, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	programs with unacceptable profit margins (the largest portion in our Store Fixtures business).
58492_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Full-year earnings from continuing operations also decreased in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	The earnings impact from lower unit volume was largely offset by cost reduction initiatives and pricing discipline.
58492_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	Other factors impacting the year-over-year earnings comparison are presented in the table above.
58492_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The divestiture note write-down (identified in the table) occurred when we learned in 2009 that the aluminum operations divested in July 2008 needed a capital infusion from the buyer due to deterioration in business conditions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	This led to a reduction in the value of the note we accepted in 2008 as partial payment for the divesture.
58492_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	Leggett accepted a more subordinate position in the capital structure of the divested operations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Impact All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	We experienced large swings in the LIFO impact in recent years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	In 2008, significant steel cost inflation along with moderately higher inventory levels resulted in LIFO expense from continuing operations of $62 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	In 2009, steel cost decreases and lower inventory levels resulted in a LIFO benefit from continuing operations of $67 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	The LIFO impact recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each year by FIFO impacts at the segment level.
58492_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Segment-level earnings in 2008 generally benefited under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs, but in the first half of 2009, were significantly burdened as we consumed higher cost steel while selling prices decreased.
58492_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Interest and Income Taxes Net interest expense decreased $8 million versus 2008, primarily the result of lower commercial paper borrowings and lower interest rates in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for 2009 was higher, at 39.0%, versus 33.8% in 2008.
58492_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	This increase is primarily due to i) tax adjustments resulting from Mexican tax law changes, and ii) the lower level of earnings and mix among tax jurisdictions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	In 2009, tax law changes in Mexico caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction.
58492_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6 million tax charge to earnings related to 2009 and prior year losses that may expire before they can be utilized to reduce taxable earnings.
58492_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	In 2008, a tax benefit associated with the write-off of an acquired company s stock was offset by increased reserves for uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for certain foreign entities.
58492_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	In the following section we discuss 2009 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from continuing operations for each of our segments.
58492_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 94.
58492_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Residential Furnishings Residential Furnishings sales decreased in 2009, reflecting weak market demand and steel-related price deflation.
58492_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	Demand in our residential markets was weak throughout 2009 as consumers world-wide continued to defer purchases of large ticket items (such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture) that contain our products.
58492_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2008, with the earnings impact from significantly lower unit volumes partially offset by cost reductions, pricing discipline, elimination of poorly performing operations, and the absence of 2008 s restructuring-related and other costs ($18 million).
58492_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	Commercial Fixturing Components Sales decreased in 2009 due to our decision in the Store Fixtures business to exit specific customer programs with unacceptable margins, reduced capital spending by retailers, and market softness in Office Furniture Components.
58492_11_ITEM7_P56_S4	EBIT and EBIT margins also decreased versus the prior year, as the impact from lower sales more than offset benefits from cost reductions, prior elimination of poorly performing facilities, and other operating improvements, as well as the absence of 2008 s restructuring-related costs ($11 million).
58492_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	2009 sales decreased, reflecting weak demand in many of our markets (including bedding, furniture, and automotive) and steel-related price deflation.
58492_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	EBIT and EBIT margins also decreased versus 2008, as lower sales more than offset cost reductions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Sales decreased in 2009, reflecting weak global demand in our markets.
58492_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus the prior year, as the impact from lower sales more than offset benefits from cost reduction initiatives and other operating improvements, as well as the absence of 2008 s restructuring-related costs ($5 million).
58492_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	Results from Discontinued Operations Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $13 million, from a loss of $19 million in 2008 to a loss of $6 million in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	This earnings increase was primarily due to lower asset impairments and restructuring-related charges, partially offset by $3 million (net of tax) of environmental charges related to an aluminum property.
58492_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	In this section, we provide details, reflecting both continuing and discontinued operations, about our:
58492_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Debt position and total capitalization We use cash for the following:
58492_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Repurchase our stock Our operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	In 2008, cash proceeds from completed divestitures were an additional significant source of funds.
58492_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	In 2009, we generated our second highest level of cash from operations in our history, at $565 million, which included a significant reduction in working capital as sales contracted.
58492_11_ITEM7_P61_S3	With a slight increase in working capital in 2010 (due to sales growth), operating cash was $363 million, still readily exceeding our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_11_ITEM7_P61_S4	For 2011, we expect cash flow from operations to again exceed $300 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P61_S5	We ended 2010 with net debt to net capital of 23.3%, its lowest level since 2004 and well below our long-term target of 30%-40%.
58492_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Page 51 presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Uses of Cash Finance Capital Requirements Improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be a key focus.
58492_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	However, cash is available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).
58492_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	PART II Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand manufacturing capacity.
58492_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The chart above shows that capital expenditures have declined in recent years; they should approximate $85 million in 2011.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	In all of our businesses, we continue to invest in the maintenance of facilities and equipment.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	However, with the sales volume contraction (versus 2008 levels) and the resulting excess productive capacity across our operations, we have significantly reduced spending on expansion projects in recent years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	With the move to role-based portfolio management, we changed our long-term priorities for allocating capital and this has also impacted capital spending levels.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	We are actively pursuing disciplined growth within our Grow business units.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S4	Expansion capital is predominantly earmarked for these opportunities.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S5	Operations designated as Core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S6	We are also seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S7	During the past few years, acquisitions were a lower priority as we were primarily focused on completing the divestitures and improving margins and returns of our existing businesses.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S8	As a result of this temporarily lower priority, and more stringent screening criteria, no significant acquisitions were completed in 2008, 2009, and 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S9	We have recently turned our focus back toward acquisitions and have begun actively soliciting opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S10	We expect acquisitions to contribute modestly to our long-term growth.
58492_11_ITEM7_P64_S11	Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 118.
58492_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	With continued improvement in margins and returns, a decrease in capital spending and acquisitions, and the completion of the divestitures, we expect (and since 2008 have had) more available cash to return to shareholders.
58492_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Higher annual dividends are one means by which that should continue to occur.
58492_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	In 2010 we modestly increased the quarterly dividend, to $.27 per share, and extended to 39 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound growth rate of 14%.
58492_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	likely remain above targeted levels in the near term.
58492_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	We anticipate spending approximately $155 million on dividends in 2011, roughly the same as in 2010, with expected share repurchases offsetting expected dividend increases.
58492_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	Cash from operations has been, and is expected to continue to be, sufficient to readily fund both capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Share repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders.
58492_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	During the past three years, we repurchased a total of 33 million shares of our stock and reduced outstanding shares by 13%.
58492_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	In 2010, we repurchased over 6 million shares at an average per-share price of $21.64 and issued 4 million shares through employee benefit plans (most of these shares were purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation).
58492_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	We expect to repurchase additional shares in 2011, with the amount of purchases dependent on factors such as general economic conditions, level of demand in our end markets, and the availability of excess cash.
58492_11_ITEM7_P67_S4	Although no specific repurchase schedule has been established, we have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2011.
58492_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	PART II Cash from Operations Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Meaningful sales and earnings improvement contributed to our 2010 cash from operations, and was partially offset by increased working capital levels associated with those higher sales.
58492_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Although working capital dollars increased, working capital as a percent of sales decreased slightly from year-end 2009 levels.
58492_11_ITEM7_P69_S2	Cash from operations in 2009 benefitted from a $186 million reduction in working capital during that year (that occurred as a result of the economy-induced sales contraction).
58492_11_ITEM7_P69_S3	The following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	(1) The accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net accounts receivable (net sales number of days in the year).
58492_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	(2) The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	(3) The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The dollar amount of accounts receivable increased from year-end 2009 levels, primarily due to higher sales.
58492_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	determining if outstanding amounts are collectible.
58492_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	In 2010, we incurred $7 million of bad debt expense as compared to $30 million in 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	The higher expense in 2009 was primarily due to a single customer bankruptcy in the Residential Furnishings segment ($10 million) and the write-down of the aluminum segment divestiture note receivable ($11 million) as discussed on page 42.
58492_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	We experienced an increase in our DSO in 2009 as customers slowed payments during the economic downturn.
58492_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	Our DSO decreased in 2010 as our markets began to improve, and we continued to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts were paid on time.
58492_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	We do not believe the decrease in DSO indicates a significant change in credit risk or has material implications on our liquidity, but instead is caused by normal differences (from year to year) in the timing of sales and cash receipts.
58492_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Inventory The dollar value of our inventories increased from year-end 2009 levels, primarily due to inflation in raw material costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	During 2010, we recognized expense of $13 million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories; in 2009 this expense totaled $16 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	We do not expect significant changes in customer or industry trends that would materially increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence.
58492_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our DIO decreased compared to the prior year as our operations continue to focus on optimizing return on assets.
58492_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	The dollar value of accounts payable increased in 2010 compared to year-end 2009, primarily due to inflation in raw material costs and also from our continued efforts to optimize payment terms with our vendors.
58492_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Our DPO has increased slightly in 2010 as we continue to work with vendors to extend our standard payment terms.
58492_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	Cash from operations in 2008 was strong despite weak market demand in the latter part of that year.
58492_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	Lower working capital (versus the prior year) contributed favorably to operating cash.
58492_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	Fourth quarter production cuts led to lower inventory levels (compared to year-end 2007).
58492_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	Accounts receivable also declined primarily due to extremely weak sales late in that year.
58492_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Working capital levels vary by segment.
58492_11_ITEM7_P80_S1	The Commercial Fixturing Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the Fixture Display group.
58492_11_ITEM7_P80_S2	This business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.
58492_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	PART II Capitalization This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	(1) These calculations include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	(2) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2010 and 2009, calculated in two ways:
58492_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.
58492_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) decreased $35 million in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	During the year, we reduced our commercial paper borrowings by $25 million and paid off $10 million of other long-term debt that came due.
58492_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	In anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P88_S3	The swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 million of future debt issuance, and mature in August 2012.
58492_11_ITEM7_P88_S4	The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% and hedge the benchmark rate of the future issuance of $200 million of debt.
58492_11_ITEM7_P88_S5	The credit spread over the benchmark bonds will continue to fluctuate until the contracts are settled (either upon an issuance of debt or upon their expiration).
58492_11_ITEM7_P88_S6	For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 119.
58492_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Short Term Borrowings We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 14 lenders that terminates in 2012.
58492_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	When we issue these letters of credit, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_11_ITEM7_P89_S3	Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	PART II The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2010 was $99 million and $198 million, respectively.
58492_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Commercial paper amounts fluctuated during the year due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements.
58492_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The amounts of letters of credit outstanding throughout the year were not materially different from the amounts outstanding at year-end.
58492_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	Based on the information currently available to us, we believe that the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the revolving credit agreement.
58492_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	In the unlikely event that a disruption in the credit market was to become so severe that we were unable to issue commercial paper, we have the contractual right to draw funds directly on the revolving credit agreement.
58492_11_ITEM7_P91_S4	In such event, the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowing.
58492_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	We also maintain an active shelf registration.
58492_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	With anticipated operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our expected ability to issue debt through our active shelf, we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, repurchase stock, fund future growth, and repay maturing debt.
58492_11_ITEM7_P92_S2	Accessibility of Cash At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $244 million primarily invested in money market funds and interest-bearing bank accounts.
58492_11_ITEM7_P92_S3	A smaller portion was invested in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_11_ITEM7_P92_S4	A substantial portion of these funds are held in international accounts and represent undistributed earnings from our foreign operations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	The tax rules governing this area are complex.
58492_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	However, subject to constantly changing facts and laws, we believe we could access a significant portion of the cash without material incremental cost.
58492_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments:
58492_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	** Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	*** Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2010 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	PART II CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM7_P99_S3	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	In the past three years, no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews.
58492_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	As a result of the deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter 2008, an interim goodwill impairment analysis was performed confirming that estimated fair value exceeded carrying values for all reporting units.
58492_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	Margins, sales levels, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Fair market values for two of the 10 reporting units exceeded book value by approximately 20%.
58492_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The goodwill associated with these reporting units is $190 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Both of these reporting units are dependent on business capital spending which has been substantially reduced in the recent economic downturn.
58492_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	Both reporting units exceeded expectations for 2010, and are expected to show further improvement in 2011.
58492_11_ITEM7_P102_S4	If actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels, future goodwill impairments could be possible.
58492_11_ITEM7_P102_S5	The remaining reporting units have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than 25%, and have goodwill of $740 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C on page 86.
58492_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	These impairments are very unpredictable, and are difficult to anticipate.
58492_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	Impairments were $2 million in 2010, $3 million in 2009, and $13 million in 2008.
58492_11_ITEM7_P108_S2	We believe that future restructuring and shut-down activities should be equal to or less than those in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM7_P108_S3	However this could change if certain product lines or businesses do not meet return expectations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P108_S4	This could cause us to decide to exit a business which could trigger long-lived asset impairment.
58492_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	If we have more than a one-year s supply of a product, we value that inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover).
58492_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e. not selling very quickly).
58492_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving.
58492_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had recorded an inventory reserve of $43 million (approximately 8% of FIFO inventories) to account for obsolete inventories.
58492_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	Prior to 2010, additions to inventory reserves averaged $22 million per year.
58492_11_ITEM7_P112_S2	In 2010, additions to reserves decreased to $13 million due to improved inventory optimization in the Residential Furnishings and Commercial Fixturing Components segments.
58492_11_ITEM7_P112_S3	Approximately two-thirds of historical write-downs relate to the Commercial Fixturing Components and Specialized Products segments due to the custom nature of their products.
58492_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	We have implemented new inventory optimization processes in many of our businesses that should reduce the impact of write-downs in the future.
58492_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	We do not expect any significant changes in customer or industry trends that would increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence.
58492_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay (since we are self-insured).
58492_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $13 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $3 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P116_S2	At December 31, 2010, we had accrued $42 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	Internal safety statistics indicate improving safety trends in the last two years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Usually, safety statistics are leading indicators of exposure trends.
58492_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	As a result of headcount reductions and improved safety trends, we expect worker compensation costs to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future.
58492_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_11_ITEM7_P119_S1	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_11_ITEM7_P119_S2	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	The average annual amount of customer-related credit losses was $16 million (less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	At December 31, 2010, our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled $23 million (about 5% of our accounts and notes receivable of $445 million).
58492_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Weak market demand intensified pressure on highly leveraged customers in some of our industries.
58492_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	In each of 2008 and 2009, we experienced bad debt expense that was approximately $15 million higher than pre-2008 levels.
58492_11_ITEM7_P121_S2	In 2010, bad debt expense returned to more normal levels, however if weak market demand persists, other bankruptcies could be possible.
58492_11_ITEM7_P121_S3	We also recognized an $11 million loss in 2009 related to the Aluminum divestiture note.
58492_11_ITEM7_P121_S4	At December 31, 2010, we had $24 million of notes outstanding, primarily related to divested businesses, and have concluded that no material reserve is required for these notes.
58492_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid, which also impacts current year pension expense.
58492_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities).
58492_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	Other assumptions include rates of compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates, and retirement ages.
58492_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	These estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	The discount rates used to calculate the pension liability and pension expense for our most significant plans decreased approximately 50 basis points in 2010 due to lower corporate bond yields.
58492_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by approximately $.4 million and decreases the plans funded status by approximately $7.2 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	The expected return on assets in 2010 held steady at 6.8%, compared to 6.9% in 2009 (after decreasing from 7.9% in 2008).
58492_11_ITEM7_P125_S3	The reduction in the rate during 2009 was primarily driven by a change in asset allocation toward more conservative investments (i.e. bonds).
58492_11_ITEM7_P125_S4	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.4 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	We adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_11_ITEM7_P129_S2	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $12 million and $28 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
58492_11_ITEM7_P129_S3	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_11_ITEM7_P129_S4	Valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a 50% probability of being realized.
58492_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	Potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed, we would incur additional taxes of approximately $41 million.
58492_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	Tax audits by various taxing authorities are expected to increase as governments continue to look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_11_ITEM7_P131_S3	Based upon past experience, we do not expect any major changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	The recovery of net operating losses (NOL s) has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_11_ITEM7_P133_S1	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred, we accrue a liability for the estimate of the ultimate loss.
58492_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.
58492_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	We have several environmental clean-up activities related to current and closed facilities that mostly involve soil and groundwater contamination.
58492_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	Based upon facts available at this time, we believe reserves are adequate, however cost estimates could change as we determine more about the severity and cost of remediation.
58492_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	CONTINGENCIES Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.
58492_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	NPI Lawsuit On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc. ( NPI ) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC ( Gamber ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements.
58492_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	NPI and Gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems.
58492_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its alleged lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber s profits in an unspecified amount.
58492_11_ITEM7_P137_S3	Although part of the claims were dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 million in disgorgement damages against Gamber.
58492_11_ITEM7_P137_S4	On August 16, the Court: (a) reduced the jury verdict to approximately $0.5 million; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict.
58492_11_ITEM7_P137_S5	The Court subsequently awarded NPI $2.0 million in attorney s fees and costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	We believe that Gamber has valid bases upon which the appellate court could overturn the verdict and the award of attorney fees and costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	We intend to vigorously pursue an appeal.
58492_11_ITEM7_P138_S2	NPI has also filed an appeal.
58492_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	We established an accrual for this suit in an amount we believe is probable.
58492_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	Also, we believe that it is probable that at least part of the verdict, attorney s fees and costs will be covered by insurance, but that coverage is subject to the insurance company s reservation of rights.
58492_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284.
58492_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	The suit is substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7_P140_S2	The prior suit was dismissed without prejudice based on its failure to make demand on the Company s Board and shareholders.
58492_11_ITEM7_P140_S3	As before, the plaintiff has not made such demand.
58492_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	The new suit was purportedly brought on the Company s behalf, naming it as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	company s stock plans; caused or allowed the Company to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold Company stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain Company corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from the Company.
58492_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	The Company has director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	The Company and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late October, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on the Company s Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the court s ruling in the prior suit, this failure to make demand should not be excused; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the suit is based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and Company stock prices that the Company believes is flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under the Company s Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_11_ITEM7_P144_S2	The hearing on the motions to dismiss is scheduled for March 15, 2011.
58492_11_ITEM7_P144_S3	We expect that the outcome of this suit will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that competitors of the Company s carpet underlay division and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws.
58492_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	To date, over 40 cases have been filed on behalf of purchasers of polyurethane foam products against over 20 defendants.
58492_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	The Company has been named as a defendant in six cases; five of which have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MD-02196.
58492_11_ITEM7_P145_S3	The first case in which the Company was named as a party: Martin Furniture Bedding, Inc. v. FXI-Foamex Innovations, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:10-cv-00178 (Western District of North Carolina) was instituted on November 15, 2010, and is also expected to be transferred.
58492_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	1979 to the present in one case, and from at least 2001 to the present in the other five cases.
58492_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	Each plaintiff also seeks attorneys fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	We expect the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in the consolidated case on or before February 28, 2011.
58492_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	The Company denies all of the allegations and will vigorously defend itself.
58492_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	This contingency is subject to many uncertainties.
58492_11_ITEM7_P147_S3	Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.
58492_11_ITEM7_P147_S4	At this time, we do not believe that it is probable that the outcome will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM7_P147_S5	We adopted new accounting guidance in 2010 as discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 83.
58492_11_ITEM7_P147_S6	The Financial Accounting Standards Board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	(Dollar amounts in millions) Interest Rates The table below provides information about the Company s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its carrying value by $6.0 at December 31, 2010, and less than its carrying value by $71.1 at December 31, 2009.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The increase in the fair market value of the Company s debt is primarily due to the decrease in credit spreads over risk-free rates as compared to the prior year end.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2010 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Company s interest costs under its medium-term note program.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Derivative Financial Instruments The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	It is the Company s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Information regarding cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and net investment hedges is provided in Note S on page 119 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Investment in Foreign Subsidiaries The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long-term commitment, and does not hedge translation exposures.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes.
58492_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company s net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to translation exposure) in foreign subsidiaries, including those held for sale, at December 31 is as follows:
58492_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	listed in Item 15, begin immediately after Item 15, and are incorporated by reference.
58492_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
58492_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation as of December 31, 2010 was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
58492_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2010, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
58492_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
58492_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P0_S0	PART III PART III Item 10.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P1_S0	Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P1_S1	The subsections entitled Proposal 1 Election of Directors, Corporate Governance, Board and Committee Composition and Meetings, Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity, Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance and Director Independence in the Company s definitive Proxy Statement for the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 12, 2011, are incorporated by reference.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P2_S0	Directors of the Company Directors are elected annually at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P2_S1	All current directors have been nominated for re-election at the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held May 12, 2011.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P2_S2	If a nominee fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in the director election, the Nominating Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the director s resignation and whether any other action should be taken.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P2_S3	If a director s resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company s next annual meeting and his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P2_S4	If the Board accepts the director s resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P2_S5	Brief biographies of the Company s Board of Directors are provided below.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P3_S0	Our employment agreements with Mr. Haffner and Mr. Glassman provide that they may terminate the agreement if not re-elected as a director.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P3_S1	See the Exhibit Index on page 129 for reference to the agreements.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P4_S0	Robert E. Brunner, age 53, has been the Executive Vice President of Illinois Tool Works (ITW), a diversified manufacturer of advanced industrial technology, since 2006.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P4_S1	He previously served ITW as President Global Auto beginning in 2005 and President North American Auto from 2003.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P4_S2	Mr. Brunner holds a degree in finance from the University of Illinois and a master s degree in business administration from Baldwin-Wallace College.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P5_S0	Mr. Brunner s experience and leadership with ITW, as a diversified manufacturer with a global footprint, provides valuable insight to our Board on operational and international issues.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P5_S1	As a director of the National Association of Manufacturers, his familiarity with public policy issues and advocacy affecting the Company is a great asset.
58492_11_ITEM9B_P5_S2	He was first elected as a director of the Company in 2009.

58492_11_ITEM14_P3_S0	PART IV Management s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of Leggett Platt, Incorporated is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
58492_11_ITEM14_P3_S1	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_11_ITEM14_P3_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
58492_11_ITEM14_P4_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett Platt assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P4_S1	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P4_S2	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_11_ITEM14_P5_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
58492_11_ITEM14_P5_S1	Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
58492_11_ITEM14_P6_S0	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 73 of this Form 10-K.
58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Leggett Platt, Incorporated:
58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S1	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S5	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S8	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S9	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

58492_11_ITEM14_P7_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_11_ITEM14_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
58492_11_ITEM14_P9_S0	being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

58492_11_ITEM14_P15_S0	A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:
58492_11_ITEM14_P16_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries ( we or our ).
58492_11_ITEM14_P17_S0	Prior to 2010, many subsidiaries outside of the United States were consolidated as of and for a fiscal year ended November 30.
58492_11_ITEM14_P17_S1	As of December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries converted to a calendar reporting year.
58492_11_ITEM14_P17_S2	The net impact of the change in fiscal years of these subsidiaries was immaterial, and is presented as an adjustment to January 1, 2010 retained earnings.
58492_11_ITEM14_P17_S3	Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States.
58492_11_ITEM14_P18_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_11_ITEM14_P19_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies.
58492_11_ITEM14_P19_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
58492_11_ITEM14_P20_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_11_ITEM14_P20_S1	ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_11_ITEM14_P20_S2	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a trade note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_11_ITEM14_P20_S3	Nontrade notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business.
58492_11_ITEM14_P20_S4	Notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_11_ITEM14_P21_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_11_ITEM14_P21_S1	Interest income is not recognized for accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_11_ITEM14_P22_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_11_ITEM14_P23_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_11_ITEM14_P23_S1	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_11_ITEM14_P24_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
58492_11_ITEM14_P24_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_11_ITEM14_P24_S2	The cost for approximately 60% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_11_ITEM14_P24_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_11_ITEM14_P24_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost at December 31, 2010 and 2009 approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_11_ITEM14_P25_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_11_ITEM14_P25_S1	Reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory on a FIFO basis were as follows: DIVESTITURES:
58492_11_ITEM14_P25_S2	A business is classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions.
58492_11_ITEM14_P25_S3	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_11_ITEM14_P25_S4	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_11_ITEM14_P25_S5	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P25_S6	Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_11_ITEM14_P26_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_11_ITEM14_P26_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_11_ITEM14_P27_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_11_ITEM14_P27_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_11_ITEM14_P27_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_11_ITEM14_P27_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_11_ITEM14_P28_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_11_ITEM14_P29_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_11_ITEM14_P30_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_11_ITEM14_P31_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, in a held for use business, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_11_ITEM14_P31_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_11_ITEM14_P31_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_11_ITEM14_P32_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_11_ITEM14_P32_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_11_ITEM14_P33_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P34_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_11_ITEM14_P35_S0	Property is tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_11_ITEM14_P35_S1	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_11_ITEM14_P35_S2	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_11_ITEM14_P36_S0	Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_11_ITEM14_P37_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_11_ITEM14_P38_S0	Reporting units are business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.
58492_11_ITEM14_P39_S0	If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group.
58492_11_ITEM14_P39_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_11_ITEM14_P40_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the business groups.
58492_11_ITEM14_P40_S1	In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price to earnings ratios.
58492_11_ITEM14_P40_S2	Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, internal sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P40_S3	Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P41_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P41_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_11_ITEM14_P41_S2	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 40 years with a weighted average of 15 years and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P42_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_11_ITEM14_P42_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_11_ITEM14_P43_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_11_ITEM14_P43_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_11_ITEM14_P43_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_11_ITEM14_P43_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers nor is it our practice to replace goods damaged or lost in transit.
58492_11_ITEM14_P44_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_11_ITEM14_P45_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_11_ITEM14_P46_S0	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P46_S1	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P47_S0	We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_11_ITEM14_P48_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_11_ITEM14_P49_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_11_ITEM14_P49_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_11_ITEM14_P50_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_11_ITEM14_P50_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_11_ITEM14_P50_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_11_ITEM14_P51_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_11_ITEM14_P52_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_11_ITEM14_P52_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_11_ITEM14_P52_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_11_ITEM14_P52_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_11_ITEM14_P53_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F. Operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Asia, Europe, Canada and Latin America.
58492_11_ITEM14_P53_S1	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_11_ITEM14_P53_S2	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_11_ITEM14_P53_S3	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of noncustomer receivables.
58492_11_ITEM14_P54_S0	Noncustomer receivables primarily consist of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business.
58492_11_ITEM14_P54_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_11_ITEM14_P55_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_11_ITEM14_P55_S1	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_11_ITEM14_P56_S0	To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_11_ITEM14_P56_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P57_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P58_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_11_ITEM14_P58_S1	Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.
58492_11_ITEM14_P58_S2	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S3	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S4	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S5	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S6	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P59_S7	Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in Other current or Sundry assets or Other current or Other long-term liabilities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P60_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_11_ITEM14_P60_S1	The effective portion of the change in fair value of a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_11_ITEM14_P60_S2	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_11_ITEM14_P60_S3	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_11_ITEM14_P61_S0	Cash flow hedges are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_11_ITEM14_P62_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_11_ITEM14_P62_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_11_ITEM14_P63_S0	Fair value hedges are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_11_ITEM14_P64_S0	The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is designated as a net investment hedge.
58492_11_ITEM14_P64_S1	The effective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives, based upon spot rates, used as a net investment hedge of a foreign operation is recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.
58492_11_ITEM14_P64_S2	Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a net investment hedge is recorded as Other (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P65_S0	Net investment hedges are presented as investing cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_11_ITEM14_P66_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_11_ITEM14_P66_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_11_ITEM14_P66_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_11_ITEM14_P67_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amendments designed to improve disclosures about fair value measurements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P68_S0	new disclosures for transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and separate disclosure about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements of Level 3 fair value measurements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P68_S1	The amendments also require clarification of existing disclosures for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements (Level 2 or Level 3).
58492_11_ITEM14_P68_S2	These disclosures were effective January 1, 2010, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 measurements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P68_S3	Those disclosures are effective January 1, 2011.
58492_11_ITEM14_P68_S4	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on future financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P69_S0	In July 2010, the FASB issued disclosure requirements regarding credit risk exposures and allowance for credit losses.
58492_11_ITEM14_P69_S1	Required additional disclosures are included in Note H and did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P69_S2	The FASB has issued other accounting guidance effective for future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe any of the other new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P70_S0	B Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale Exit activities associated with an extensive review of our business portfolio in 2007 (referred to as the 2007 Strategic Plan, which included the divestiture of several operations, the pruning of some business and the closure of certain underperforming plants) were substantially complete by the end of 2008.
58492_11_ITEM14_P70_S1	However, a small amount of subsequent activity directly related to these divestitures continued into 2009 and 2010, including the 2009 write-down of a promissory note received in connection with the 2008 Aluminum Products segment divestiture as discussed below.
58492_11_ITEM14_P70_S2	All other activity is reported within earnings from discontinued operations unless otherwise noted.
58492_11_ITEM14_P70_S3	Segments in which these operations were previously reported are detailed in the table below.
58492_11_ITEM14_P71_S0	Storage Products unit No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_11_ITEM14_P72_S0	Coated Fabrics unit No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_11_ITEM14_P73_S0	Fibers unit The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $8.6 ($7.8 loss net of tax).
58492_11_ITEM14_P74_S0	Aluminum Products segment This segment was sold for $300.0 in cash, a $25.0 subordinated promissory note (fair value of $14.1), and shares of preferred stock (no book value, with face value not to exceed $25.0, dependent upon future performance of the divested business).
58492_11_ITEM14_P74_S1	The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of $7.6 ($16.0 gain after taxes).
58492_11_ITEM14_P74_S2	In 2009, we learned that this business needed a capital infusion due to deterioration in business conditions and determined that the collectability of the promissory note was not reasonably assured.
58492_11_ITEM14_P74_S3	We recorded a $10.6 non-cash reduction in the value of the promissory note that is reported in Other expense (income), net on the Statements of Operations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P74_S4	On June 30, 2009, we surrendered the promissory note, and in exchange, received $15.0 face amount (fair value of $3.5) of redeemable preferred stock.
58492_11_ITEM14_P75_S0	The fair value estimate incorporated various inputs related to the aluminum operations including: historical financial information, assumptions about future revenue, earnings, and cash flows and earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics.
58492_11_ITEM14_P76_S0	Management believes it was in our best interest to accept the preferred stock in exchange for the promissory note due to the higher likelihood of recovery resulting from the modification to the buyer s capital structure.
58492_11_ITEM14_P77_S0	Wood Products unit The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $4.1 ($4.4 loss net of tax).
58492_11_ITEM14_P78_S0	Plastics unit The sale of this unit resulted in a pre-tax loss of $9.4 ($6.7 loss net of tax).
58492_11_ITEM14_P79_S0	The dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_11_ITEM14_P80_S0	One automotive seating components operation The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2.5 ($1.7 loss net of tax).
58492_11_ITEM14_P81_S0	In addition to the divestitures discussed above, we also sold our Prime Foam Products Unit in 2007.
58492_11_ITEM14_P81_S1	Results from discontinued operations and activity directly related to these divestitures subsequent to the date of sale for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P82_S0	(1) Goodwill and other impairment charges were recorded to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as discussed in Note C.
58492_11_ITEM14_P83_S0	In 2009 we recorded charges for an environmental issue related to an aluminum property that was sold prior to the divestiture of this business.
58492_11_ITEM14_P84_S0	Net assets held for sale by segment at December 31 were as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P85_S0	These tables include $24.9 and $22.2 of property, plant and equipment held for sale at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, primarily associated with the closings of various operations and prior year restructurings not associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan.
58492_11_ITEM14_P85_S1	These amounts also include land and buildings retained when we divested the Aluminum Products segment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P85_S2	Although market conditions have delayed the sale of these properties, we are fully committed to selling and are actively marketing these assets.
58492_11_ITEM14_P85_S3	The major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P86_S0	C Impairment Charges Goodwill Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year or as triggering events may occur.
58492_11_ITEM14_P87_S0	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in June of each year as discussed in Note A. Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_11_ITEM14_P87_S1	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_11_ITEM14_P87_S2	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_11_ITEM14_P87_S3	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_11_ITEM14_P88_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_11_ITEM14_P89_S0	comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years.
58492_11_ITEM14_P89_S1	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium.
58492_11_ITEM14_P89_S2	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_11_ITEM14_P89_S3	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_11_ITEM14_P89_S4	Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_11_ITEM14_P90_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_11_ITEM14_P90_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_11_ITEM14_P91_S0	Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P91_S1	The goodwill impairment reviews performed in June 2010 and 2009 indicated no goodwill impairments, and there were no triggering events in either year that required additional goodwill reviews.
58492_11_ITEM14_P91_S2	Reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in these reviews are presented in the tables below.
58492_11_ITEM14_P91_S3	If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.
58492_11_ITEM14_P92_S0	Reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values were:
58492_11_ITEM14_P93_S0	The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2008 indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P94_S0	The deterioration in the economic and financial climate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the associated revision to earnings as a result of lower demand was considered a triggering event.
58492_11_ITEM14_P94_S1	An interim goodwill impairment analysis was performed in the fourth quarter 2008 that confirmed fair values exceeded carrying value for all reporting units.
58492_11_ITEM14_P94_S2	Future cash flow assumptions were reduced to reflect lowered sales and production levels for 2009 and 2010, returning to historical levels thereafter.
58492_11_ITEM14_P94_S3	Other significant assumptions used in the 2008 fourth quarter review are presented in the table below.
58492_11_ITEM14_P95_S0	In November 2007, we determined that we would exit certain of our business activities, and adopted a new strategic plan as discussed in Note B. As presented in the table below, asset impairment charges were recorded as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell for the targeted divestitures became more certain.
58492_11_ITEM14_P95_S1	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers.
58492_11_ITEM14_P95_S2	Deterioration in the economy and credit markets and the impact on available credit for potential buyers in the last half of 2008 were also considerations in our 2008 fair value estimates.
58492_11_ITEM14_P96_S0	Other Long-Lived Assets As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_11_ITEM14_P97_S0	We have recorded various impairments for property, plant and equipment as presented in the table below which did not individually result in a material charge to earnings for the periods presented.
58492_11_ITEM14_P97_S1	An impairment of $9.5 was recognized in 2008 associated with a Latin America supply agreement due to a significant reduction in the expected future cash flows associated with these agreements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P97_S2	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers for fixed assets and discounted cash flows for intangible assets.
58492_11_ITEM14_P98_S0	The pre-tax impact of impairment charges on continuing and discontinued operations is summarized in the following table.
58492_11_ITEM14_P99_S0	Asset impairments associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Impairment of goodwill and Other (income) expense, net.
58492_11_ITEM14_P99_S1	Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_11_ITEM14_P99_S2	Of the total impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, $.9, $3.0 and $32.3, respectively, were associated with the 2007 Strategic Plan.
58492_11_ITEM14_P100_S0	D Restructuring We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures.

58492_11_ITEM14_P111_S2	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_11_ITEM14_P111_S3	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_11_ITEM14_P112_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory.
58492_11_ITEM14_P112_S1	Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P113_S0	We evaluate performance based on earnings from operations before interest and income taxes (EBIT).
58492_11_ITEM14_P114_S0	Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices.
58492_11_ITEM14_P115_S0	Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P115_S1	Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales and EBIT.

58492_11_ITEM14_P125_S0	* As discussed in Note B, we recorded a $10.6 bad debt expense related to the Aluminum divestiture note write-down that occurred when we learned in 2009 that the Aluminum operation divested in July 2008 needed a capital infusion from the buyer due to deterioration in business conditions.
58492_11_ITEM14_P125_S1	This led to a reduction in the value of the note we accepted as partial payment for the divestiture.

58492_11_ITEM14_P129_S0	Short Term Borrowings We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 of commercial paper through a program backed by our $600 credit agreement with a syndicate of 14 lenders that terminates April 30, 2012.
58492_11_ITEM14_P129_S1	Based on the information currently available to us, we believe the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement.
58492_11_ITEM14_P130_S0	The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250.
58492_11_ITEM14_P130_S1	When we issue these letters of credit, our capacity under the agreement and, consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_11_ITEM14_P130_S2	Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were: Under the syndicated agreement, depending on the prior notice period, we may elect to borrow based on the greater of:
58492_11_ITEM14_P131_S0	For short-term administrative convenience, the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus 3 / 4 of 1%.
58492_11_ITEM14_P132_S0	The revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit:
58492_11_ITEM14_P133_S0	The amount of assets sold, transferred or disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 20% of total consolidated assets.

58492_11_ITEM14_P138_S0	L Stock-Based Compensation We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.
58492_11_ITEM14_P139_S0	One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.
58492_11_ITEM14_P140_S0	Shares are issued from treasury for our stock plans activity.
58492_11_ITEM14_P140_S1	Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan.
58492_11_ITEM14_P140_S2	At December 31, 2010, the following shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:
58492_11_ITEM14_P141_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on the results of operations (including discontinued operations) for each of the years ended December 31: When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a windfall tax benefit is created.
58492_11_ITEM14_P141_S1	The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital.
58492_11_ITEM14_P142_S0	When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax shortfall is created.
58492_11_ITEM14_P142_S1	To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital.
58492_11_ITEM14_P143_S0	Net windfall is presented below: (1) Stock Option Grants We have granted stock options in several areas as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P144_S0	As compensation of outside directors Options granted to a broad group of employees on a discretionary basis We grant stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_11_ITEM14_P144_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months, 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_11_ITEM14_P144_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_11_ITEM14_P145_S0	A retirement termination occurs if the employee is age 65, or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination.
58492_11_ITEM14_P145_S1	For retirement terminations, options continue to vest and remain exercisable for 3 years and 6 months after termination of employment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P145_S2	Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.
58492_11_ITEM14_P146_S0	Officers and directors receive stock option awards.
58492_11_ITEM14_P146_S1	Other employees participate in option choice programs.
58492_11_ITEM14_P146_S2	In connection with the January 2010 grant, we gave most participants the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options.
58492_11_ITEM14_P146_S3	The value of the cash alternative (paid in the first quarter) was equal to approximately one-half of the Black Scholes value of the option grant the employee would have otherwise received.
58492_11_ITEM14_P147_S0	In January 2011, we offered two different option choice programs.
58492_11_ITEM14_P147_S1	One group of employees was offered the same option/cash choice as in 2010, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone.
58492_11_ITEM14_P147_S2	Another group of employees, generally higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of four options foregone for every one offered.
58492_11_ITEM14_P147_S3	The stock units vest in one-third increments at 12 months, 24 months and 36 months after the date of grant.
58492_11_ITEM14_P148_S0	Deferred Compensation Program We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_11_ITEM14_P149_S0	Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_11_ITEM14_P149_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five, divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_11_ITEM14_P149_S2	The option has a 10-year term.
58492_11_ITEM14_P149_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_11_ITEM14_P150_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_11_ITEM14_P151_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on the acquisition date and they vest immediately.
58492_11_ITEM14_P152_S0	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_11_ITEM14_P152_S1	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_11_ITEM14_P152_S2	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_11_ITEM14_P152_S3	Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.
58492_11_ITEM14_P152_S4	Beginning in 2010, stock units may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_11_ITEM14_P152_S5	Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.
58492_11_ITEM14_P153_S0	Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.

58492_11_ITEM14_P159_S1	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_11_ITEM14_P160_S0	(2) Stock-Based Retirement Plans We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_11_ITEM14_P160_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_11_ITEM14_P160_S2	In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels as defined in the SBP and the ESUP are obtained.
58492_11_ITEM14_P161_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_11_ITEM14_P161_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_11_ITEM14_P161_S2	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service.
58492_11_ITEM14_P162_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_11_ITEM14_P163_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_11_ITEM14_P163_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S0	Contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S1	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S2	Beginning in 2010, units from the ESUP may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S3	The ESUP offered no diversification opportunity for contributions through December 31, 2010.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S4	Beginning April 1, 2011, participant contributions will be credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant and we will make premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S5	A participant s diversified investment account balance will be adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S6	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units in these accounts.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S7	The diversified investment accounts will consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and will be settled in cash.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S8	Company matching contributions will be in the form of stock units.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S9	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S10	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.
58492_11_ITEM14_P164_S11	Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows: Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.

58492_11_ITEM14_P167_S1	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3-year performance period.
58492_11_ITEM14_P168_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies and are based upon assumptions similar to those used for stock options.
58492_11_ITEM14_P168_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three-year vesting period.
58492_11_ITEM14_P168_S2	Beginning with the 2010 award that will be settled in 2013, thirty-five percent (35%) of the award will be paid out in cash.
58492_11_ITEM14_P168_S3	This portion is recorded as a $1.1 liability on the December 31, 2010 balance sheet and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.

58492_11_ITEM14_P181_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P181_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_11_ITEM14_P182_S0	The table below presents the discount rate used for the benefit obligation for our most significant pension plans.
58492_11_ITEM14_P182_S1	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P182_S2	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings as discussed below.
58492_11_ITEM14_P183_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_11_ITEM14_P184_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_11_ITEM14_P185_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_11_ITEM14_P186_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_11_ITEM14_P186_S1	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_11_ITEM14_P187_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P187_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P188_S0	Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_11_ITEM14_P188_S1	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P189_S0	to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_11_ITEM14_P190_S0	Approximately 60% of our significant plans (the frozen plans) are employing a Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% bonds and 40% equities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P190_S1	The remaining significant plans (the active plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% bonds, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_11_ITEM14_P191_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to six different investments: four mutual funds and two separate accounts.
58492_11_ITEM14_P191_S1	The mutual funds, all passively managed low-cost index funds, include:
58492_11_ITEM14_P192_S0	Total Stock Market Index: Large, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles; using index sampling.
58492_11_ITEM14_P193_S0	FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world; using index sampling.
58492_11_ITEM14_P194_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market; index sampling.
58492_11_ITEM14_P195_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market; using index sampling.
58492_11_ITEM14_P195_S1	The separate accounts are invested as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P196_S0	Small cap U.S. equities: Portfolio of small capitalization U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2000 Value Index.
58492_11_ITEM14_P197_S0	U.S. equities: Broad portfolio of U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index.
58492_11_ITEM14_P198_S0	Future Contributions and Benefit Payments We expect to contribute $8.7 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2011.
58492_11_ITEM14_P198_S1	Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P198_S2	Other Benefit Plans Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P198_S3	Contributions to union sponsored, defined benefit, multiemployer pension plans were less than $.1 in continuing operations and less than $.6 in discontinued operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
58492_11_ITEM14_P198_S4	These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_11_ITEM14_P199_S0	plans, and our participation has continued to decrease in recent years.
58492_11_ITEM14_P199_S1	We do not believe there is a material withdrawal liability associated with these plans.
58492_11_ITEM14_P200_S0	N Income Taxes The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P201_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components: Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P202_S0	In 2010, 2009, and 2008 the tax rate benefitted from income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, and the favorable impact of foreign tax credits.
58492_11_ITEM14_P203_S0	In 2009, tax law changes in Mexico caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction.
58492_11_ITEM14_P203_S1	As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6.0 tax charge to earnings related to current and prior year tax losses that may expire before they can be utilized.
58492_11_ITEM14_P203_S2	During 2008, we realized a $7.8 tax benefit associated with the write-off of an acquired Company s stock, which had a favorable impact on the tax rate.
58492_11_ITEM14_P203_S3	We recognized net excess tax benefits (costs) of approximately $0.1, $1.4, and ($.3) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital as discussed in Note L. We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_11_ITEM14_P204_S0	In the U.S. and many of the state jurisdictions, and in many foreign countries where we file tax returns, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_11_ITEM14_P204_S1	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_11_ITEM14_P204_S2	In addition, we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_11_ITEM14_P204_S3	The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010, is $42.6, of which $25.7 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_11_ITEM14_P204_S4	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 is as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P205_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_11_ITEM14_P206_S0	As of December 31, 2010, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2007 through 2010.
58492_11_ITEM14_P206_S1	Amended federal returns have also been filed for 2006, 2005, and 2004, with refunds of $5.9, $4.3 and $2.5 expected, respectively.
58492_11_ITEM14_P206_S2	In 2010, IRS examinations of the 2004 and 2005 amended returns were completed, and tentative agreement was reached with the IRS.
58492_11_ITEM14_P206_S3	Consequently, we adjusted our reserve for uncertain tax positions with respect to the largest issue in connection with these examinations, related to research and development credit claims, which had a favorable impact on our tax provision of $3.6.
58492_11_ITEM14_P206_S4	Additionally, in 2010 we were notified that our 2008 federal tax return would be examined.
58492_11_ITEM14_P206_S5	The audit has commenced, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P207_S0	Five tax years were undergoing (or subject to) audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2005 through 2009.
58492_11_ITEM14_P207_S1	Examinations are in progress for each of these years and are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P207_S2	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination as well, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P207_S3	We are not aware of any changes that would materially impact our tax expense for an increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
58492_11_ITEM14_P208_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P208_S1	The major temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P209_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_11_ITEM14_P209_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, and limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, were factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_11_ITEM14_P209_S2	These loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, but no significant amounts expire in any one year.
58492_11_ITEM14_P210_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_11_ITEM14_P211_S0	The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.
58492_11_ITEM14_P212_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested.
58492_11_ITEM14_P212_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2010, which are indefinitely reinvested, are approximately $180.9.
58492_11_ITEM14_P212_S2	If such earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental taxes would be approximately $41.4 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.
58492_11_ITEM14_P213_S0	In 2010, we repatriated $108 million of foreign earnings, resulting in a net tax charge of $4.7 million.
58492_11_ITEM14_P214_S0	Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P215_S0	The components of other (income) expense from continuing operations were as follows:
58492_11_ITEM14_P216_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_11_ITEM14_P217_S0	Q Fair Value We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P217_S1	The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets for potential impairment as discussed in Notes B and C. The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivatives hedging financial risks primarily related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P218_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_11_ITEM14_P219_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_11_ITEM14_P220_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_11_ITEM14_P221_S0	flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_11_ITEM14_P222_S0	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_11_ITEM14_P222_S1	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_11_ITEM14_P222_S2	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_11_ITEM14_P223_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_11_ITEM14_P224_S0	The following tables present assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
58492_11_ITEM14_P225_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions: During 2010 we also increased our ownership portion to 100% in an automotive business that was previously not wholly owned for $8.6, of which $7.6 represented net cash consideration.
58492_11_ITEM14_P225_S1	See the table below for acquisitions during the periods presented.
58492_11_ITEM14_P226_S0	We are finalizing all the information required to complete purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_11_ITEM14_P227_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_11_ITEM14_P227_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2010 and 2009 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented, are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P228_S0	The terms of certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid if the acquired company s performance exceeds certain targeted levels.
58492_11_ITEM14_P228_S1	Such additional consideration may be paid in cash, and is estimated and recorded at the acquisition date as additional purchase price.
58492_11_ITEM14_P228_S2	At December 31, 2010, there is no substantial remaining consideration payable.
58492_11_ITEM14_P229_S0	S Derivative Financial Instruments Risk Management Strategy Objectives We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P229_S1	In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks.
58492_11_ITEM14_P229_S2	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P229_S3	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P229_S4	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments.
58492_11_ITEM14_P229_S5	The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.
58492_11_ITEM14_P230_S0	Cash Flow Hedges At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had outstanding derivative financial instruments that hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows.
58492_11_ITEM14_P231_S0	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_11_ITEM14_P232_S0	The commodity cash flow hedges manage natural gas commodity price risk.
58492_11_ITEM14_P232_S1	All commodity hedges at December 31, 2010 had maturities of less than three years.
58492_11_ITEM14_P232_S2	We routinely hedge commodity price risk up to 36 months.
58492_11_ITEM14_P233_S0	The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_11_ITEM14_P233_S1	The foreign currency cash flow hedges outstanding at December 31, 2010 had maturity dates within one year.
58492_11_ITEM14_P233_S2	In general, foreign currency cash flow hedges have maturities within two years.
58492_11_ITEM14_P234_S0	In anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest swaps in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM14_P234_S1	The swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 of planned debt issuance in August 2012.
58492_11_ITEM14_P234_S2	The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% and hedge the benchmark rate of an expected issuance of $200 of debt.
58492_11_ITEM14_P234_S3	The credit spread over the benchmark bonds will continue to fluctuate until the time of issuance.
58492_11_ITEM14_P235_S0	Our fair value hedges manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries inter-company assets and liabilities.
58492_11_ITEM14_P235_S1	Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_11_ITEM14_P235_S2	These fair value hedges generally have a maturity date within one year.
58492_11_ITEM14_P236_S0	We had no net investment hedge activity in 2010 or 2009.
58492_11_ITEM14_P236_S1	In September 2008, we liquidated a $30.0 net investment hedge of a Swiss subsidiary.
58492_11_ITEM14_P236_S2	The liquidation had a cash cost of $4.4, which is presented as an investing cash flow in our Statement of Cash Flows.
58492_11_ITEM14_P236_S3	We have deemed all ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness.
58492_11_ITEM14_P236_S4	If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated condensed statements of operations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P237_S0	Derivatives Not Qualifying for Hedge Accounting Treatment At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had one derivative transaction that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_11_ITEM14_P237_S1	Gains or losses on this transaction are recorded directly to income and expense in the period impacted, and offset the majority of gains and losses on the underlying Euro inter-company debt.
58492_11_ITEM14_P237_S2	The following table sets forth the pre-tax gains (losses) from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented.
58492_11_ITEM14_P238_S0	This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.
58492_11_ITEM14_P239_S0	T Contingencies The Company is a defendant in various proceedings involving employment, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
58492_11_ITEM14_P239_S1	When it is probable, in management s judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_11_ITEM14_P239_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings, and the total liabilities recorded are not material to our financial position.
58492_11_ITEM14_P240_S0	NPI Lawsuit On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc. ( NPI ) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC ( Gamber ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements.
58492_11_ITEM14_P240_S1	NPI and Gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems.
58492_11_ITEM14_P240_S2	NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its alleged lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber s profits in an unspecified amount.
58492_11_ITEM14_P240_S3	Although part of the claims were dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 in disgorgement damages against Gamber.
58492_11_ITEM14_P240_S4	On August 16, the Court: (a) reduced the jury verdict to approximately $0.5; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict.
58492_11_ITEM14_P240_S5	The Court subsequently awarded NPI $2.0 in attorney s fees and costs.
58492_11_ITEM14_P241_S0	We believe that Gamber has valid bases upon which the appellate court could overturn the verdict and the award of attorney fees and costs.
58492_11_ITEM14_P241_S1	We intend to vigorously pursue an appeal.
58492_11_ITEM14_P241_S2	NPI has also filed an appeal.
58492_11_ITEM14_P242_S0	We established an accrual for this suit in an amount we believe is probable.
58492_11_ITEM14_P242_S1	Also, we believe that it is probable that at least part of the verdict, attorney s fees and costs will be covered by insurance, but that coverage is subject to the insurance company s reservation of rights.
58492_11_ITEM14_P243_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284.
58492_11_ITEM14_P243_S1	The suit is substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009.
58492_11_ITEM14_P243_S2	The prior suit was dismissed without prejudice based on its failure to make demand on the Company s Board and shareholders.
58492_11_ITEM14_P243_S3	As before, the plaintiff has not made such demand.
58492_11_ITEM14_P244_S0	The new suit was purportedly brought on the Company s behalf, naming it as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_11_ITEM14_P244_S1	The plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating the company s stock plans; caused or allowed the Company to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold Company stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_11_ITEM14_P244_S2	The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain Company corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_11_ITEM14_P244_S3	The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from the Company.
58492_11_ITEM14_P245_S0	The Company has director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_11_ITEM14_P246_S0	Company stock prices that the Company believes is flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_11_ITEM14_P246_S1	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under the Company s Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_11_ITEM14_P246_S2	The hearing on the motions to dismiss is scheduled for March 15, 2011.
58492_11_ITEM14_P246_S3	The Company expects that the outcome of this suit will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P247_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts alleging that competitors of the Company s carpet underlay division and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. antitrust laws.
58492_11_ITEM14_P247_S1	To date, over 40 cases have been filed on behalf of purchasers of polyurethane foam products against over 20 defendants.
58492_11_ITEM14_P247_S2	The Company has been named as a defendant in six cases; five of which have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation, Case No. 1:10-MD-02196.
58492_11_ITEM14_P247_S3	The first case in which the Company was named as a party: Martin Furniture Bedding, Inc. v. FXI-Foamex Innovations, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:10-cv-00178 (Western District of North Carolina) was instituted on November 15, 2010, and is also expected to be transferred.
58492_11_ITEM14_P248_S0	In the suits to which the Company is a party, the plaintiffs, on behalf of the class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products during the period 1979 to the present in one case, and from at least 2001 to the present in the other five cases.
58492_11_ITEM14_P248_S1	Each plaintiff also seeks attorneys fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P249_S0	We expect the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint in the consolidated case on or before February 28, 2011.
58492_11_ITEM14_P249_S1	The Company denies all of the allegations and will vigorously defend itself.
58492_11_ITEM14_P249_S2	This contingency is subject to many uncertainties.
58492_11_ITEM14_P249_S3	Therefore, based on the information available to date, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.
58492_11_ITEM14_P249_S4	At this time, we do not believe that it is probable that the outcome will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM14_P250_S0	* Earnings in the first two quarters of 2009 were significantly impacted as we consumed the majority of higher cost steel but recognized only about half of the offsetting LIFO benefit (consistent with our historical practice of recording annual LIFO impacts evenly throughout the year).
58492_11_ITEM14_P250_S1	The remainder of the LIFO benefit was recognized in the last half of 2009, a period during which we experienced only minimal impact from higher cost steel.
58492_11_ITEM14_P251_S0	(1) The balances at December 31, 2009 and 2008 include assets held for sale of $.1 and $.4, respectively, of allowance for doubtful receivables, and $.8 and $2.9, respectively, of excess and obsolete inventory reserve.
58492_11_ITEM14_P252_S0	(2) Uncollectible accounts charged off, net of recoveries.
58492_11_ITEM14_P253_S0	(3) Federal tax effect of state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and credits and changes in currency exchange rates.

58492_11_ITEM14_P276_S1	Unless the Committee determines otherwise, the number of Option shares granted to a Participant is equal to the nearest number of whole shares determined under the following formula:
58492_11_ITEM14_P277_S0	Compensation Foregone means the Compensation the Participant elected to defer into Options.
58492_11_ITEM14_P278_S0	The Exercise Price for each share covered by an Option is the fair market value of Company stock on the Grant Date.
58492_11_ITEM14_P278_S1	Options will be granted as of the last business day in December of each year or such other date as the Committee determines (the Grant Date ).

58492_11_ITEM14_P280_S1	Such payment may be made in cash, by delivering or attesting to ownership of shares of L P Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock.

58492_11_ITEM14_P281_S1	Upon the death of a Participant, the Option may be exercised by his Beneficiary or, if the Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary, by his legal representative.
58492_11_ITEM14_P281_S2	If any Option has not been fully exercised on the Expiration Date, the unexercised portion of the Option shall be deemed exercised on such Expiration Date, provided the then market price of a share of L P Common Stock exceeds the per share Exercise Price.
58492_11_ITEM14_P281_S3	In such event, shares of Common Stock will not be issued until the Exercise Price and any other required amounts have been paid.
58492_11_ITEM14_P281_S4	If the Company has not received payment of the Exercise Price and any other required amounts within 30 days after the Expiration Date, the exercise will be void and the Company will have no further obligation to the Participant with respect to the expired Option.

58492_11_ITEM14_P286_S3	The Company may, at any time, require a Participant to settle the tax liability in cash.
58492_11_ITEM14_P286_S4	Although the Company intends to settle Participants accounts in stock, notwithstanding any other provision of the Program, the Company reserves the right to pay Stock Units in cash in lieu of shares of Common Stock.
58492_11_ITEM14_P286_S5	If settled in cash, the amount of the distribution will be equal to the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Company s Flexible Stock Plan) of the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued.

58492_11_ITEM14_P287_S5	The Participant may make an election to extend the payout period or change the form of distribution for Stock Unit and L P Cash Deferrals, not to exceed any maximum payout period established by the Committee.
58492_11_ITEM14_P287_S6	For purposes of the foregoing, each payout date in an installment distribution election will be treated as a separate election.

58492_11_ITEM14_P288_S2	Such a conversion may only be made during the year in which the Compensation subject to the deferral election is earned.

58492_11_ITEM14_P289_S0	The Company s obligation to a Participant for Stock Unit and L P Cash Deferrals is a mere promise to pay shares or money in the future and the Participant will have the status of a general unsecured creditor of the Company.
58492_11_ITEM14_P289_S1	The Committee and the Company s Secretary will make all determinations regarding benefits under the Program in accordance with ERISA.

58492_11_ITEM14_P291_S0	COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS 6.1 Impact on Benefit Plans .
58492_11_ITEM14_P291_S1	The deferral of Compensation under the Program is not intended to affect other Employer benefit plans in which the Participant is participating or may be eligible to participate.
58492_11_ITEM14_P291_S2	The impact of the Program on other benefits is described below.
58492_11_ITEM14_P292_S0	401(k) Plans Participation in the Program will reduce compensation eligible for contributions under an Employer 401(k) plan in the year the compensation is earned.
58492_11_ITEM14_P292_S1	For Participants in the Company s Retirement 401(k) ( Retirement K ), this could result in a corresponding reduction of the Company s matching contributions in the Retirement K. The Company s Retirement K Excess Program is intended to address this limitation and other limitations affecting matching contributions in the Retirement K.
58492_11_ITEM14_P292_S2	In certain circumstances, the Retirement K Excess Program will make a cash payment equal to the lost matching contribution to the Retirement K. When previously deferred compensation comes out of the Program, the compensation will be considered eligible compensation for a contribution under the L P 401(k) Plan.
58492_11_ITEM14_P293_S0	For stock distributions (e.g. a Stock Unit distribution or an Option exercise), the Company must, to the extent possible, take the 401(k) contribution from a Participant s other cash compensation in the calendar year.
58492_11_ITEM14_P294_S0	Executive Stock Unit Program The amount of payroll deduction for Stock Units under the Company s Executive Stock Unit Program ( ESU Program ) will be calculated as if no deferral had occurred.
58492_11_ITEM14_P294_S1	In the case of an ESU Program Participant who defers 100% of Compensation under the Deferred Compensation Program, the Company will make the Matching Contribution and Additional Matching Contribution under the ESU Program as though the full Participant s Contribution had been made.
58492_11_ITEM14_P295_S0	Discount Stock Plan Contributions under the Discount Stock Plan will be calculated as if no deferral had occurred.
58492_11_ITEM14_P296_S0	Life Insurance and Disability Benefits To the extent the level of benefits is based upon a Participant s compensation, Deferred Compensation will be included when it would have otherwise become payable but for the deferral.
58492_11_ITEM14_P296_S1	Except as provided in Section 6.1, the Participant must make contributions and payments under all Employer benefit plans in which he is participating in the amounts required as if no deferral had occurred.
58492_11_ITEM14_P296_S2	If there is not sufficient Compensation after deferral from which to withhold required contributions and payments, the Participant must make arrangements suitable to the Company for payment of the required amounts.
58492_11_ITEM14_P297_S0	Except to the extent the Committee otherwise designates pursuant to Section 7.2(e), the Committee will control and manage the operation and administration of the Program.
58492_11_ITEM14_P297_S1	The Committee will have such authority as may be necessary to discharge its responsibilities under the Program, including the authority to: (a) interpret the provisions of the Program; (b) adopt rules of procedure consistent with the Program; (c) determine questions relating to Benefits and rights under the Program; (d) maintain records concerning the Program; (e) designate any Company employee or committee to carry out any of the Committee s duties, including authority to manage the operation and administration of the Program; and (f) determine the content and form of the Participant s Election and all other documents required to carry out the Program.
58492_11_ITEM14_P298_S0	7.3 Section 16 Officers and Non-Employee Directors .
58492_11_ITEM14_P298_S1	Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Committee may not delegate its authority with respect to Section 16 Officers, and (ii) the Board of Directors must approve any action related to Benefits for non-employee directors or advisory directors.
58492_11_ITEM14_P299_S0	7.4 Compliance with Applicable Law .

58492_11_ITEM15_P5_S0	Summary Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_11_ITEM15_P5_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores and automobiles.
58492_11_ITEM15_P5_S2	As discussed below, our operations are organized into 19 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.
58492_11_ITEM15_P5_S3	In addition, certain of our former businesses are classified as discontinued operations.
58492_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	Our Residential Furnishings segment began with an 1885 patent of the steel coil bedspring.
58492_11_ITEM15_P6_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_11_ITEM15_P6_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_11_ITEM15_P6_S3	Long production runs, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves.
58492_11_ITEM15_P6_S4	In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.
58492_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	Customers Most of our Residential Furnishings customers are manufacturers of finished bedding products (mattresses and foundations) or upholstered furniture for residential use.
58492_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	We also sell many products, including ornamental beds, bed frames, power foundations, carpet underlay, and top-of-bed accessories, directly to retailers and distributors.
58492_11_ITEM15_P7_S2	We sell geo components products primarily to dealers, contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies.
58492_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	Our Fixture Display group designs, produces, installs and manages our customers store fixtures and point-of-purchase projects.
58492_11_ITEM15_P8_S1	Our Office Furniture Components group designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of engineered components targeted for the office seating market.
58492_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	Bases, columns, back rests, casters and frames for office chairs, and control devices that allow office chairs to tilt, swivel and elevate Customers Customers of the Commercial Fixturing Components segment include:
58492_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	We believe that the quality of the Industrial Materials segment s products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing.
58492_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_11_ITEM15_P10_S2	We have six wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_11_ITEM15_P10_S3	Our Tubing group operates two major plants that also supply nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing.
58492_11_ITEM15_P10_S4	In addition to supporting our internal requirements, the Industrial Materials segment supplies many external customers with wire and tubing products.
58492_11_ITEM15_P11_S0	We use about half of our wire output and about one-quarter of our welded steel tubing output to manufacture our own products.
58492_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	For example, we use our wire and steel tubing to make:
58492_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	Automotive seat components and frames The Industrial Materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers, including:
58492_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, produces and sells components for automotive seating, specialized machinery and equipment, and service van interiors.
58492_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	Our established design capability and focus on product development have made us a leader in innovation.
58492_11_ITEM15_P13_S2	We also benefit from our broad geographic presence and our internal production of key raw materials and components.
58492_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	Specialty trailers used by telephone, cable and utility companies Customers Our primary customers for the Specialized Products segment include:
58492_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	In November 2007 we outlined significant changes to the Company s strategy.
58492_11_ITEM15_P15_S1	Beginning Stock Price) , changed the priorities for use of cash, adopted role-based portfolio management and implemented more rigorous strategic planning.
58492_11_ITEM15_P15_S2	Our goals were to: i) divest or fix low performing businesses, ii) return more cash to investors, iii) improve margins and returns on the businesses we keep, and iv) then begin to carefully and conservatively grow the Company (at 4-5% of annual revenue).
58492_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	I We have made significant progress over the past three years.
58492_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	The divestitures were largely complete by the end of 2008; margins and returns have improved; and we have returned much of our excess cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and share repurchases.
58492_11_ITEM15_P16_S2	Our focus now is two-part: i) continue improving margins, and ii) begin laying the groundwork for long-term 4-5% growth.
58492_11_ITEM15_P16_S3	Some of the activities associated with the change in strategy led to asset impairment and restructuring costs during the past three years.
58492_11_ITEM15_P16_S4	For information related to those costs, see Note C on page 86 and Note D on page 90 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	Key Financial Metric TSR is the primary financial metric we use to monitor performance.
58492_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S P 500, over the long term.
58492_11_ITEM15_P17_S2	For the three-year period ended December 31, 2010 we generated TSR of 16% per year, on average, which places us in the top 8% of the S P 500.
58492_11_ITEM15_P17_S3	We employ four key levers to achieve TSR: i) revenue growth, ii) margin expansion, iii) dividends, and iv) share repurchases.
58492_11_ITEM15_P17_S4	In 2008, dividends and stock buyback largely drove our TSR; during 2009, we benefited significantly from margin improvement; and in 2010, revenue growth (from improved market demand) boosted TSR.
58492_11_ITEM15_P17_S5	We expect that this balanced approach will generate consistently higher TSR.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Consistent with the change in our strategy, we modified some of our incentive plans to emphasize the importance of TSR.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	Beginning in January 2008, we introduced a new performance incentive for senior executives based solely on 3-year TSR relative to a group of 320 peers.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S2	We also modified business unit bonuses to give more importance to achieving higher returns on the assets under their direct control.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S3	The strategic changes have increased available cash.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S4	We expect to continue returning much of this cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S5	During the past three years, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and divestitures.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S6	Furthermore, as anticipated, since 2007 we ve reduced combined annual spending for acquisitions and capital expenditures by over 70% (to $73 million in 2010).
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S7	Since late 2007, we have raised quarterly dividends by 50%, from $.18 per share to $.27 per share currently.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S8	During the past three years, we have also spent over $600 million to repurchase 33 million shares of our stock, which reduced outstanding shares by approximately 13%.
58492_11_ITEM15_P18_S9	In 2010, we repurchased over 6 million shares at an average per share price of $21.64 (and issued 4 million shares through employee benefit plans) (most of these shares are purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation).
58492_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	We manage our business units as a portfolio, with different roles (Grow, Core, Fix, Divest) for each business unit based upon competitive advantages, strategic position, and financial health.
58492_11_ITEM15_P19_S1	We undergo a rigorous strategic planning process, in part to assess each business unit s portfolio role.
58492_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth in competitively advantaged positions.
58492_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	Business units in the Fix category will be given a limited time in which to significantly improve performance.
58492_11_ITEM15_P21_S2	Finally, a few small business units (or portions of business units) are considered non-strategic, and may be divested as the M A market recovers and allows for reasonable sales prices.
58492_11_ITEM15_P21_S3	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of the Company s cost of capital.
58492_11_ITEM15_P21_S4	Each business unit has opportunity to improve, and may employ a variety of means to achieve higher returns including trimming expenses, introducing new products, improving productivity, adopting more disciplined pricing, reducing working capital, and consolidating assets.
58492_11_ITEM15_P21_S5	Business units that fail to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital will move to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	During 2009 and 2010 significant effort went into improving margins.
58492_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	EBIT margin for 2009 was 7.5% on $3.06 billion of sales while EBIT margin for 2010 was 8.6% on sales of $3.36 billion.
58492_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	Gross margin for 2009 and 2010 was 20.6% and 19.5%, respectively.
58492_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Disciplined Growth Consistent with the plan we unveiled in 2007, we are now beginning to devote resources to the next phase of our strategy.
58492_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	We aim to eventually achieve consistent, long-term, profitable growth of 4-5% annually.
58492_11_ITEM15_P23_S2	To achieve this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2%-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity.
58492_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions.
58492_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us, and in which Leggett would possess a competitive advantage.
58492_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	Both efforts are receiving significant management attention and priority, and we are making progress in both areas.
58492_11_ITEM15_P24_S3	We have had success this past year with new products introduced in our office components, automotive, and home furniture components businesses.
58492_11_ITEM15_P24_S4	Though individually those were modest successes, collectively they added to sales and earnings growth in 2010.
58492_11_ITEM15_P24_S5	In addition, we have instituted some of the processes that need to be in place to identify new market opportunities.
58492_11_ITEM15_P24_S6	Successful development of new growth platforms will take time; we do not anticipate significant contributions from these activities in the near term.
58492_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	PART I Acquisitions and Divestitures Historically, our typical acquisition targets have been small, private, profitable, entrepreneurial companies that manufacture goods either within our existing product lines or one step away from those product lines and complementary to our existing businesses.
58492_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	As part of our change in strategic direction, we expect fewer and more strategic acquisitions to be completed.
58492_11_ITEM15_P25_S2	All acquisitions should create value by enhancing TSR; they should have clear strategic rationale and sustainable competitive advantage in attractive markets.
58492_11_ITEM15_P25_S3	We have had no significant acquisitions in the last three years.
58492_11_ITEM15_P25_S4	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 118 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	Divestitures During the past three years we divested seven businesses (as a part of our strategic realignment), including the entire Aluminum Products segment, for total after-tax cash proceeds of $433 million.
58492_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	The largest portion of these proceeds ($408 million) related to the divestitures completed in 2008.
58492_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	2010 Divestiture We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment) in the third quarter of 2010.
58492_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit.
58492_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.
58492_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	2009 Divestiture We divested the Coated Fabrics business unit (previously in the Residential Furnishings segment) in the third quarter of 2009.
58492_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_11_ITEM15_P28_S2	Coated Fabrics is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2009 revenue of approximately $12 million.
58492_11_ITEM15_P28_S3	We divested five significant businesses in 2008 with annualized sales of approximately $780 million.
58492_11_ITEM15_P28_S4	The largest divestiture (approximately $485 million in annualized revenue) was the Aluminum Products segment which was sold in July 2008.
58492_11_ITEM15_P28_S5	We also sold four other business units in 2008 Wood Products and Fibers (previously in the Residential Furnishings segment); Plastics (previously in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment); and the dealer portion of Commercial Vehicle Products (previously in the Specialized Products segment).
58492_11_ITEM15_P28_S6	All of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations.
58492_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	Segment Financial Information For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, earnings before interest and taxes, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 94 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_11_ITEM15_P29_S2	The percentages of our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Our international operations are principally located in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.
58492_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	Shafts for the appliance industry Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe demand for components is growing.
58492_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.
58492_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Political instability in certain countries Our Specialized Products segment, which derives 77% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	Geographic Areas of Operation We have production, warehousing and distribution facilities in countries around the world.
58492_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	Below is a list of countries where we have facilities associated with continuing operations:
58492_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	For further information concerning our external sales from continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 94 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	The following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales from continuing operations by classes of similar products for the last three years: Distribution of Products In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own sales personnel.
58492_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
58492_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	Raw Materials The products we manufacture in continuing operations require a variety of raw materials.
58492_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	Woven and non-woven fabrics We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Automotive seating components We supply the majority of our steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	Our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	We also produce welded steel tubing both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.
58492_11_ITEM15_P39_S3	In addition, we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_11_ITEM15_P39_S4	We have experienced volatility in raw material prices over the past few years, most notably in steel.
58492_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	Significant steel cost increases in 2008 were followed by significant cost decreases in 2009 as global economies weakened.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	In both cases, we generally adjusted pricing to our customers to reflect the changes in commodity costs.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S2	In late 2009 and early 2010, steel costs increased, and again we implemented price increases to recover the majority of the higher costs.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S3	By the end of 2010, we were facing further inflation in steel costs, and announced and began implementing additional price increases in early 2011.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S4	The degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs, should they occur, could influence our future earnings.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S5	Also, if raw material costs decrease there may be downward pressure on selling prices, temporarily resulting in lower segment margins, as we consume higher cost inventories.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S6	Higher raw material costs in recent years have led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S7	In some cases, higher cost components have been replaced with lower cost components, causing us to shift production accordingly.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S8	This has primarily impacted profit margins in our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials segments.
58492_11_ITEM15_P41_S9	We are responding by developing new products (including new types of innersprings, box springs and reclining chair mechanisms) that enable our customers to reduce their total costs, and in certain instances, provide higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.
58492_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	Customer Concentration We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	In 2010, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations.
58492_11_ITEM15_P42_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 22% of these consolidated revenues.
58492_11_ITEM15_P42_S3	The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing Components and Specialized Products segments.
58492_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	PART I Patents and Trademarks The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations.
58492_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our continuing operations.
58492_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities.
58492_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	However, we estimate the cost of research and development associated with continuing operations ranged from $20 to $30 million per year in each of the last three years.
58492_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 19,000 employees, of which roughly 13,600 were engaged in production.
58492_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	Of the 19,000, approximately 8,700 were international employees (5,000 in China).
58492_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	Labor unions represented roughly 11% of our employees.
58492_11_ITEM15_P46_S3	We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2010.
58492_11_ITEM15_P46_S4	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2011.
58492_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.
58492_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately 18,500 employees.
58492_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Competition Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_11_ITEM15_P49_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_11_ITEM15_P49_S4	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	I We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates related to safety and environmental matters.
58492_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_11_ITEM15_P52_S2	In instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas, our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently.
58492_11_ITEM15_P52_S3	We currently operate 10 facilities in China.
58492_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam.
58492_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	We saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began.
58492_11_ITEM15_P53_S2	As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved.
58492_11_ITEM15_P53_S3	The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009.
58492_11_ITEM15_P53_S4	The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014.
58492_11_ITEM15_P53_S5	Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin.
58492_11_ITEM15_P53_S6	Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	We experienced a temporary loss of market share during the last half of 2010 as certain of our customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from European suppliers.
58492_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	The opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted from a combination of factors that benefited European suppliers in the early summer: i) the weaker Euro, ii) temporarily lower raw material costs in Europe, and iii) greater excess capacity as a result of last summer s economic turmoil in Europe.
58492_11_ITEM15_P54_S2	Because of the slowing of consumer demand for mattresses in the last half of 2010, it took longer for these imported products to be consumed, but by year-end, we had regained the majority of the volume.
58492_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	Seasonality As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses.
58492_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.
58492_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	However, in 2010, sales in the first and second quarters were higher on strength in our Residential Furnishings and Commercial Fixturing Components segments.
58492_11_ITEM15_P56_S2	Consumer demand for bedding and furniture was stronger during the first half of the year, we believe in part due to larger income tax refunds and home purchasing incentives.
58492_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	stronger in the first half of the year, as retailers increased store remodeling activity (a larger portion of which occurred in the earlier part of the year) and decreased new store construction.
58492_11_ITEM15_P57_S1	Notwithstanding 2010, our four segments tend to experience seasonality as follows:
58492_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	Residential Furnishings: typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during those periods.
58492_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Commercial Fixturing Components: generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the first and fourth quarters normally lower.
58492_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	This aligns with the retail industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.
58492_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	Industrial Materials: minimal variation in sales throughout the year.
58492_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	Specialized Products: relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.
58492_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	Backlog Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	Working Capital Items For further information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of Cash from Operations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 48.
58492_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_11_ITEM15_P63_S2	While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
58492_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	The U.S. Congress has considered legislation to address climate change that is intended to reduce overall green house gas emissions, including carbon dioxide.
58492_11_ITEM15_P64_S1	Similar initiatives have also been pursued at the state level.
58492_11_ITEM15_P64_S2	In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a determination that green house gas emissions may be a threat to human health and the environment.
58492_11_ITEM15_P64_S3	It is uncertain if, when, and in what form, a mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be enacted either through legislation or regulation.
58492_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	increase our operating costs, including costs of raw materials, transportation and electricity.
58492_11_ITEM15_P65_S1	In that event, our intent would be to raise prices in order to cover the cost increases.
58492_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	Internet Access to Information We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section.
58492_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
58492_11_ITEM15_P66_S2	In addition to these reports, the Company s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for its Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors can be found on our website.
58492_11_ITEM15_P66_S3	Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Discontinued Operations Several of our prior businesses are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses.
58492_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	We divested this segment in July 2008.
58492_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	It produced and sold non-automotive aluminum, zinc and magnesium die castings, and new and refurbished dies (also known as molds or tools) for all types and sizes of die casting machines.
58492_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	It also provided machining, coating, finishing, sub-assembly and other value-added services for die cast components.
58492_11_ITEM15_P68_S2	These products and services were sold into various end markets.
58492_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	Wood Products unit, Fibers unit and the Coated Fabrics unit (each previously reported in the Residential Furnishings segment).
58492_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	We divested the Wood Products unit in the third quarter of 2008.
58492_11_ITEM15_P70_S1	It sold wood frames and cut-to-size dimension lumber to bedding manufacturers.
58492_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	We divested the Fibers unit in the fourth quarter of 2008.
58492_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	It sold fiber cushioning material primarily to bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers.
58492_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	We divested the Coated Fabrics unit in the third quarter of 2009.
58492_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	It sold non-slip rug underlay and shelf liners primarily to retailers and distributors.
58492_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	Plastics unit and the Storage Products unit (each previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment).
58492_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	(i) The Plastics unit, which was divested in the third quarter of 2008, sold injection molded plastic components primarily for manufacturers of lawn care equipment and power tools.
58492_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Storage Products unit was divested in the third quarter of 2010.
58492_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	It sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and healthcare industries.
58492_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	An automotive seating components operation and the dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit (each previously reported in the Specialized Products segment) .
58492_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	The automotive seating components operation, which we divested in the first quarter of 2008, sold welded assemblies, and wire and tubular frames for automotive seating.
58492_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	We divested the dealer portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products unit in the third quarter of 2008.
58492_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	It sold truck bodies for cargo vans, flatbed trucks, service trucks and dump trucks primarily to end-users of light-to-medium duty commercial trucks.
58492_11_ITEM15_P78_S2	For further information on discontinued operations, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores and automobiles.
58492_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	As discussed below, our operations are organized into 20 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.
58492_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Residential Furnishings segment began with an 1885 patent of the steel coil bedspring.
58492_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves.
58492_12_ITEM1_P1_S4	In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.
58492_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Customers Most of our Residential Furnishings customers are manufacturers of finished bedding products (mattresses and foundations) or upholstered furniture for residential use.
58492_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	We also sell many products, including ornamental beds, bed frames, adjustable beds, carpet underlay, and top-of-bed accessories, directly to retailers and distributors.
58492_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	We sell Geo Components products primarily to dealers, contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies.
58492_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Fixture Display group designs, produces, installs and manages our customers store fixtures projects.
58492_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our Office Furniture Components group designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of engineered components targeted for the office seating market.
58492_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Bases, columns, back rests, casters and frames for office chairs, and control devices that allow office chairs to tilt, swivel and elevate Customers Customers of the Commercial Fixturing Components segment include:
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe that the quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing.
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	We have five wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	Our Steel Tubing business unit operates two major plants that also supply nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing.
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we also supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western).
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S6	Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the new Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.
58492_12_ITEM1_P6_S7	Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	Titanium and nickel tubing for the aerospace industry Customers We use about half of our wire output and about one-quarter of our steel tubing output to manufacture our own products.
58492_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	For example, we use our wire and steel tubing to make:
58492_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	Automotive seat components and frames The Industrial Materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers, including:
58492_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, produces and sells components for automotive seating, specialized machinery and equipment, and service van interiors.
58492_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our established design capability and focus on product development have made us a leader in innovation.
58492_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	We also benefit from our broad geographic presence and our internal production of key raw materials and components.
58492_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Specialty trailers used by telephone, cable and utility companies Customers Our primary customers for the Specialized Products segment include:
58492_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Telecom, cable, home service and delivery companies Strategic Direction Key Financial Metric Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends Received)/Beginning Stock Price.
58492_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S P 500 over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S P 500) on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2011 we generated TSR of 21% per year, on average, which places us in the top 38% of the S P 500.
58492_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition, our TSR has exceeded that of the S P 500 index for four consecutive years.
58492_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	I Our incentive programs reward return generation.
58492_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	More Cash to Shareholders During the past three years, we generated approximately $1.26 billion of cash flow from operations.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S2	Capital expenditures were $75 million in 2011, compared to $68 million in 2010, and $83 million in 2009.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S3	Since late 2007, we have raised quarterly dividends by 56%, from $.18 per share to $.28 per share currently.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S4	During the past three years, we have also repurchased roughly 27 million shares of our stock (and issued approximately 11 million shares through employee benefit plans), which reduced the net outstanding shares by approximately 11%.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S5	In 2011, we repurchased approximately 10 million shares at an average per share price of $22.86 (and issued approximately 3 million shares through employee benefit plans).
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S6	As discussed in more detail below under Acquisitions, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million in January 2012.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S7	As such, we do not anticipate repurchasing a significant number of shares in 2012.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S8	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S9	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest).
58492_12_ITEM1_P15_S10	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as EBIT and EBITDA growth, operating cash flows, and return on assets.
58492_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets.
58492_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Disciplined Growth Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually.
58492_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity.
58492_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions.
58492_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.
58492_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	We seek acquisitions within our growth businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, and a strong fit with the Company; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return, have an internal rate of return in excess of 10% and have positive discounted cash flow; (c) for stand-alone companies: generally, revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on companies: generally, revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
58492_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	We had no significant acquisitions in 2009, 2010 or 2011.
58492_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	In January 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube, which produces thin-walled, larger diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products for aerospace applications.
58492_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Western specializes in fabricating products from specialty materials, such as titanium and other refractory alloys, nickel-based alloys, stainless steel and other high strength metals.
58492_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Western supplies its products primarily to the commercial aerospace market, but also to the defense and industrial markets.
58492_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	Western s products are utilized in aircraft systems and aircraft engine systems, including fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, life support, stability and cooling systems.
58492_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Western operates two facilities: one in Kirkland, Washington, and another near San Diego, California.
58492_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	Western had 2011 sales of $57 million and is part of our Industrial Materials segment.
58492_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	The cash purchase price of $188 million was financed with proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes under our existing commercial paper program, as discussed in Note U on page 122 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 115 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Divestitures 2011 Divestiture There were no significant divestitures in 2011.
58492_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	2010 Divestiture We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment) in the third quarter of 2010.
58492_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit.
58492_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.
58492_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	2009 Divestiture We divested the Coated Fabrics business unit (previously in the Residential Furnishings segment) in the third quarter of 2009.
58492_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	Coated Fabrics is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2009 revenue of approximately $12 million.
58492_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	I We also divested five other businesses in 2008 as part of our 2007 strategic alignment, including our former Aluminum Products segment.
58492_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	Segment Financial Information For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, earnings before interest and taxes, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 91 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	The percentages of our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our international operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico.
58492_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Shafts for the appliance industry Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for components is growing.
58492_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.
58492_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Political instability in certain countries Our Specialized Products segment, which derives 75% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	I Geographic Areas of Operation We have manufacturing facilities in countries around the world, as shown below.
58492_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	For further information concerning our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 91 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Sales by Product Line The following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales by classes of similar products for the last three years: Distribution of Products In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel.
58492_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
58492_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Raw Materials The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials.
58492_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	Automotive seating components We supply the majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.
58492_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	PART I Customer Concentration We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	In 2011, our largest customer accounted for less than 6% of our consolidated revenues.
58492_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 22% of these consolidated revenues.
58492_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing Components and Specialized Products segments.
58492_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Patents and Trademarks The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2011.
58492_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
58492_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.
58492_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities.
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	However, we estimate the cost of research and development to be approximately $20 million per year in each of the last three years.
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S3	Employees As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 18,300 employees, of which roughly 12,900 were engaged in production.
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S4	Of the 18,300, approximately 8,600 were international employees (4,900 in China).
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S5	Labor unions represented roughly 15% of our employees.
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S6	We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2011.
58492_12_ITEM1_P40_S7	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2012.
58492_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.
58492_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 19,000 employees.
58492_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	PART I Competition Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_12_ITEM1_P43_S4	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	We expect these products to continue to grow.
58492_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	Some of our traditional bedding customers are beginning to offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel.
58492_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	These hybrid products allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring.
58492_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam.
58492_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	We saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began.
58492_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding Group improved.
58492_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009.
58492_12_ITEM1_P47_S4	The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014.
58492_12_ITEM1_P47_S5	Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin.
58492_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Seasonality As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses.
58492_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.
58492_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Residential Furnishings: typically does not exhibit any significant seasonality, except for a reduction in fourth quarter sales.
58492_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	Commercial Fixturing Components: generally has modestly stronger third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the fourth quarter significantly lower.
58492_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	This aligns with the retail industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.
58492_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	Industrial Materials: minimal variation in sales throughout the year.
58492_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Specialized Products: relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.
58492_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Backlog Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	Working Capital Items For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of Cash from Operations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 46.
58492_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Company does not have a significant amount of sales derived from Government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any Government.
58492_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section.
58492_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
58492_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	In addition to these reports, the Company s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section.
58492_12_ITEM1_P58_S4	Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Discontinued Operations Some of our prior businesses are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses.
58492_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Coated Fabrics unit (previously reported in the Residential Furnishings segment).
58492_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	We divested the Coated Fabrics unit in the third quarter of 2009.
58492_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	It sold non-slip rug underlay and shelf liners primarily to retailers and distributors.
58492_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Storage Products unit (previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment).
58492_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	The Storage Products unit was divested in the third quarter of 2010.
58492_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	It sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and healthcare industries.
58492_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	For further information on these discontinued operations and 2009 activity primarily related to the Aluminum Products Segment that was divested in 2008, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, energy costs and interest rates.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P1_S5	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our products.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In 2011, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We serve customers in a variety of industries, some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand due to a weak global economy.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	A sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could adversely impact our sales, net earnings, financial condition, cash flow and liquidity.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs move with the market.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	PART I Steel is our most significant raw material.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S6	This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S7	This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S8	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Competition could adversely affect our operating results.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S12	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S13	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S14	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S15	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P8_S16	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If sales of foam or air core mattresses continue to grow appreciably, it could reduce our market share in the U.S. bedding market, and negatively impact our sales and earnings.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P10_S5	At December 31, 2011, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $1.04 billion, or approximately 36% of our total assets.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled approximately $648 million, or approximately 22% of total assets.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2011 indicated no goodwill impairments, but fair market value for one of our ten reporting units (Fixture Display) only exceeded book value by approximately 15%.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	The fair market values of all other reporting units exceeded book value by more than 30%.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	The goodwill associated with the Fixture Display reporting unit was $112 million at December 31, 2011.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The unit is dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Retailer activity was moderately lower in 2011, and the unit did not meet expectations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels, future goodwill impairments could be possible.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In December 2011, management approved a restructuring plan which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming plants.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	This resulted in long-lived asset impairment of $31 million.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Prior to that event, our last material asset impairment occurred in 2007.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In 2011, 29% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of, and collections from, our customers, and manage the accounting for, and payment to, our vendors.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems.
58492_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.
58492_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We currently have 132 manufacturing locations, of which 89 are located across the United States and 43 are located in 17 foreign countries.
58492_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	Manufacturing Locations by Segment Manufacturing facilities that we own produced approximately 70% of our sales in 2011.
58492_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_12_ITEM2_P0_S5	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 99 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	In the opinion of management the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_12_ITEM2_P1_S3	With our current utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate over $4 billion in revenue (assuming current sales mix).
58492_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	To trim unproductive capacity and reduce overhead costs, management, in December 2011, approved a restructuring plan which included the closure of four underperforming branches.
58492_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	Of the closed branches, one was in the Residential Furnishings segment, one was in Commercial Fixturing Components and two were in the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.

58492_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	We are targeting a dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by earnings per share) of 50-60%, though it has been and will likely be higher for the near term.
58492_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	Our dividend payout percentage was 146%, 92% and 106% in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.
58492_12_ITEM5_P1_S3	See the discussion of the Company s targeted dividend payout under Pay Dividends in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 44.
58492_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	The table below is a listing of our repurchases of the Company s common stock during the fourth quarter of 2011.
58492_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	(1) This number includes 9,740 shares which were not repurchased as part of a publicly announced plan or program, all of which were shares surrendered in transactions permitted under the Company s benefit plans.
58492_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	It does not include shares withheld for taxes in net option exercises and net stock unit conversions during the quarter.
58492_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	(2) On August 4, 2004, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year beginning January 1, 2005.
58492_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	This standing authorization was first reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, filed August 5, 2004, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors.
58492_12_ITEM5_P4_S2	As such, effective January 1, 2012, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2012.
58492_12_ITEM5_P4_S3	No specific repurchase schedule has been established.
58492_12_ITEM5_P4_S4	Moreover, with the $188 million cash acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube in January 2012, the Company does not expect to purchase a significant number of shares under this authority in 2012.
58492_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The Company incurred asset impairment charges and restructuring-related charges totaling $44 million in 2011.
58492_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	All of these charges were recognized in continuing operations.
58492_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	The Company incurred asset impairment and restructuring-related charges totaling $84 million in 2008.
58492_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	Of these charges, approximately $33 million were associated with continuing operations and $51 million related to discontinued operations.
58492_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	The Company incurred asset impairment and restructuring-related charges totaling $305 million in 2007.
58492_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	Of these charges, approximately $159 million were associated with continuing operations and $146 million related to discontinued operations.
58492_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	Amounts for 2007 and 2008 were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of noncontrolling interests from Other expense (income), net to (Earnings) attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011, with automotive and office furniture leading the way.
58492_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness.
58492_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Sales growth in 2011 was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The main revenue catalyst was raw material-related price inflation, but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade) also contributed to the year-over-year increase.
58492_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was up slightly.
58492_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Earnings decreased in 2011, largely due to restructuring-related charges associated with the decision to close manufacturing facilities in certain businesses facing persistently weak market demand.
58492_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	With concerns about weak markets, we continued to closely monitor working capital levels, and ended the year with working capital as a percent of annualized sales well below our target.
58492_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Operating cash for the full year once again exceeded the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	In August, we raised the quarterly dividend to $.28 per share and extended to 40 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases at a 14% compound annual growth rate.
58492_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	We also repurchased 10 million shares of our stock during 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	We ended 2011 with net debt to net capital below our long-term targeted range and over $500 million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility.
58492_12_ITEM7_P2_S6	The revolving credit agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five-year term ending in 2016.
58492_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Late in the year, we announced our plan to purchase Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems.
58492_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	This acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	We completed the acquisition in early 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR), on a rolling three-year basis, to that of peer companies.
58492_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We target TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long-term.
58492_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	For the three years ended December 31, 2011, we generated TSR of 21% per year on average.
58492_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	That places us in the top 38% of the S P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.
58492_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	INTRODUCTION Total Shareholder Return Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price].
58492_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	We seek to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S P 500) on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2011, we generated TSR of 21% per year on average, while the S P 500 index generated average TSR of 14% per year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	That places us in the top 38% of the S P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.
58492_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our incentive programs reward return generation.
58492_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control.
58492_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Customers We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing less than 6% of our sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.
58492_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	Major Factors That Impact Our Business Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Market Demand Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	All these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011, with automotive and office furniture leading the way.
58492_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness.
58492_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	PART II It is our belief that the U.S. economy will face headwinds for longer than we previously expected.
58492_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	We are no longer willing to wait for an economic recovery to bolster earnings, and as a result, we have taken further steps to improve ongoing profitability.
58492_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	We have closed some production facilities and reduced overhead costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	While these activities improve our cost structure, capacity utilization levels in the majority of our operations remain low.
58492_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	Our current productive capacity should readily accommodate sales of over $4 billion (assuming current sales mix).
58492_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	Until our spare capacity is fully utilized, each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume is expected to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Raw Material Costs In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	This purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S6	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S7	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S8	Steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_12_ITEM7_P13_S9	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	In late 2009 and early 2010, steel costs increased, and we raised our selling prices to recover the majority of the higher costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	By the end of 2010, we were facing further inflation in steel costs, and we implemented additional price increases in early 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	By mid-year, market prices for certain types of steel had begun to decrease.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	The margin pressure we experienced in the last half of 2011 resulted in part from lowering our selling prices (selectively) in advance of our average cost of steel declining, in order to maintain market share and minimize deterioration in product mix.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S4	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S5	Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S6	As a result, metal margins within the steel industry (and in our rod producing operation) were lower during 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S7	Scrap costs increased further in early 2011 but market prices for steel rod also increased.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S8	Metal margins for the full year 2011 were slightly improved.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S9	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S10	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_12_ITEM7_P14_S11	In late 2010 these costs began increasing, and in early 2011, we implemented price increases to recover the majority of the higher costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	We experienced this de-contenting effect in our Residential Furnishings segment in the last half of 2011 (however selective selling price reductions helped contain this activity).
58492_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	As our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address commodity inflation, our profit margins were negatively impacted.
58492_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	We must continue to find ways to assist our customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Competition Many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.
58492_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_12_ITEM7_P16_S5	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P16_S6	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	We experienced a temporary loss of market share during the last half of 2010 as certain of our bedding customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from European suppliers.
58492_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	The opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted from a combination of factors: i) the weaker Euro; ii) temporarily lower wire costs; and iii) greater excess capacity as a result of economic turmoil in Europe.
58492_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	By the end of 2010, we had regained the majority of the lost volume.
58492_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	The margin pressure we experienced in the last half of 2011 resulted in part from price competition in other of our businesses as we reduced prices (selectively) to maintain market share in light of depressed industry volume.
58492_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	We expect these products to continue to grow.
58492_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	Some of our traditional bedding customers are beginning to offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel.
58492_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	These hybrid products allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring.
58492_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam.
58492_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding group improved.
58492_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	The investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014.
58492_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin.
58492_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	2011 Restructuring Plan In December 2011, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our overhead costs and improve ongoing profitability.
58492_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	The activities primarily entailed the closure of four underperforming facilities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	We incurred a $37 million pre-tax (largely non-cash) charge in the 4 th quarter of 2011 primarily related to this plan, which included $31 million of long-lived asset impairments and $6 million of other restructuring-related costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	We expect an additional $2 million of restructuring costs in 2012, with these plant closures complete by mid-year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P22_S3	Earnings should benefit in 2012 from the cost savings associated with the 2011 Restructuring Plan and other restructuring activity initiated in the latter part of 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P22_S4	Our 2012 forecast anticipates an approximate $15-$20 million pre-tax earnings benefit ($.07-$.10 per share) from these activities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	We divested seven businesses as a part of the strategic realignment we announced in late 2007.
58492_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The bulk of this activity (five of the seven divestitures) was complete by the end of 2008.
58492_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	In 2009, we sold the Coated Fabrics business unit, and in 2010 we divested the Storage Products business unit.
58492_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	Results of operations for these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM7_P23_S4	For more information about discontinued operations and the divestitures, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 vs. 2010 Sales growth in 2011 was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The main revenue catalyst was raw material-related price inflation, but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade) also contributed to the year-over-year increase.
58492_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was up slightly.
58492_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	Full-year earnings decreased, from $177 million in 2010 to $153 million in 2011 primarily from higher restructuring-related costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2011, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Sales grew 8% in 2011, largely from inflation and currency rate changes.
58492_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Unit volumes grew 3% primarily due to a shift in the mix of sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade).
58492_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Across the bulk of our businesses, in aggregate, market demand increased slightly.
58492_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011, with automotive and office furniture leading the way.
58492_12_ITEM7_P26_S4	In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P26_S5	Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness.
58492_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	PART II Earnings decreased in 2011, largely due to restructuring-related costs associated with the decision (in the fourth quarter) to close manufacturing facilities in certain businesses facing persistently weak market demand.
58492_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Other factors, including slightly higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate, and higher selling, administrative, and other costs essentially offset during the year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	Impact All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	In both 2011 and 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense ($14 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2010).
58492_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Interest and Income Taxes Net interest expense in 2011 was roughly flat with 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The 2011 consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate of 24.2% was lower than the 28.1% incurred in 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Several factors contributed to the reduction, including changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions, one-time benefits from tax planning strategies, and tentative agreement reached with the IRS regarding the examination of our 2004 through 2008 tax years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	As a result of the tax planning strategies and audit, we recognized tax benefits of $5 million in 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P30_S4	This is comparable to a tax benefit realized in 2010 related to the IRS examination in that year of certain tax credit claims, which was substantially offset by incremental taxes from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings in that year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P30_S5	We also experienced other less significant, discrete tax items (both favorable and unfavorable) that substantially offset for the year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	Segment Results In the following section we discuss 2011 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for each of our segments.
58492_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 91.
58492_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Residential Furnishings Residential Furnishings sales increased in 2011, primarily from inflation and currency, which generated little profit.
58492_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Unit volume in the segment was flat.
58492_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Demand in most of our residential markets continued to be soft as consumers postponed spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of an ongoing weak economy.
58492_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	Full-year unit volumes were essentially flat in our U.S. Spring business but declined in International Spring and Furniture Hardware (from pronounced market weakness mid-year).
58492_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	The only business in the segment that posted meaningful unit growth was our Adjustable Bed business, where unit volumes grew 44% for the full year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	PART II EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, primarily due to higher restructuring-related costs (of $9 million), less favorable sales mix, inflation, and other operating cost increases.
58492_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	We initiated restructuring activities in the last half of 2011 in an effort to improve ongoing profitability, and part of that activity occurred in Residential Furnishings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We consolidated four operations in the segment, including two carpet underlay plants, a Canadian spring facility, and a fabric coating business.
58492_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	We expect segment margins to benefit in 2012 from the cost savings associated with these activities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	Commercial Fixturing Components Sales decreased in 2011, largely from lower demand in our Store Fixtures business, as some of the large, value-oriented retailers significantly curtailed both new store construction and remodeling activity during the year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	In contrast, market demand continued to improve in Office Furniture Components as that business posted strong growth for the full year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	EBIT and EBIT margins also decreased versus the prior year, primarily due to lower sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	Our efforts to improve ongoing profitability resulted in the decision late in 2011 to consolidate one of our six remaining store fixture locations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	The majority of the sales from this operation will be supplied through two of our remaining facilities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	In addition, consistent with our stated plan to continually assess our portfolio and exit non-core businesses, we divested our small, U.K.-based point-of-purchase display operation in January 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S6	Industrial Materials 2011 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill, both of which generated little incremental profit.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S7	Full-year unit volumes declined in both Wire Drawing and Steel Tubing, reflecting weak bedding, furniture, and store fixtures end markets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S8	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, mainly from higher restructuring-related costs (of $23 million).
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S9	EBIT margins also decreased during the year as a result of a change in sales from intra-segment to trade at our steel rod mill.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S10	These trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs, and have kept the mill running at full capacity while internal demand for steel rod has been down.
58492_12_ITEM7_P37_S11	However, this sales shift is dilutive to margins since it increases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels.
58492_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Restructuring activities in late 2011 involved the closure of two facilities in the segment.
58492_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	We closed one of our six domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into two of the remaining plants.
58492_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	We also announced the closing of a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks into the domestic appliance industry.
58492_12_ITEM7_P38_S3	These activities should improve capacity utilization within the segment in 2012 and benefit future earnings and margins.
58492_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Specialized Products In Specialized Products, sales increased in 2011, primarily reflecting improved demand across the major businesses in the segment.
58492_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Changes in currency exchange rates also added to year-over-year sales growth.
58492_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	Automotive growth continues to be driven by the recovery in global industry production levels.
58492_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	EBIT increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales partially offset by higher restructuring-related costs (of $7 million), raw material cost inflation, and currency impacts.
58492_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Results from Discontinued Operations Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, was not material in either year (2010 or 2011).
58492_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	PART II RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2010 vs. 2009 During 2010, sales increased 10%, reflecting improved market demand in several of our businesses.
58492_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Full-year earnings also increased, from $121 million in 2009 to $184 million in 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2010, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	In 2010, sales increased 10% versus 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Demand improved in many of our end markets during the year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	Retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong.
58492_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Our residential bedding and furniture markets started 2010 strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger-ticket items slowed.
58492_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	These earnings improvements were partially offset by lower metal margins.
58492_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Scrap costs increased in 2010, and while market prices for steel rod also increased, those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	As a result, metal margins within the steel industry (and in our rod producing operation) were lower during 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Impact All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_12_ITEM7_P47_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	We experienced a large swing in the LIFO impact in recent years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	In 2009, significant steel cost decreases resulted in a LIFO benefit of $67 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	In 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense of $15 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	The LIFO impact recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each year by FIFO impacts at the segment level.
58492_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Segment-level earnings in 2009 were significantly burdened (primarily in the first half of the year) as we consumed higher cost steel while selling prices decreased.
58492_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	In 2010, segment-level earnings benefitted under the FIFO method from the effect of rising commodity costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	Interest and Income Taxes Net interest expense in 2010 was roughly flat with 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for 2010 was lower, at 28.1%, versus 39.0% in 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	In 2010, the tax rate benefitted from the higher level of earnings, changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, and tentative settlements of tax examinations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S3	During 2010, we reached tentative agreement with the IRS on their examination of certain tax credit claims, and recognized tax benefits of $5 million associated with those claims.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S4	These benefits were partially offset by incremental taxes resulting from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S5	During 2010, we repatriated $108 million of foreign earnings, which resulted in a net tax charge of $5 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S6	In 2009, the higher tax rate reflected unfavorable tax adjustments resulting from Mexican tax law changes, which caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction.
58492_12_ITEM7_P51_S7	As a result, we recorded a $6 million tax charge to earnings related to 2009 and prior year losses that might expire before they could be utilized to reduce taxable earnings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	PART II Segment Results In the following section we discuss 2010 sales and EBIT for each of our segments.
58492_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 91.
58492_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Residential Furnishings Residential Furnishings sales increased in 2010, primarily due to market share gains in our furniture components business.
58492_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Demand in most of our residential markets was relatively strong during the first half of the year but weakened noticeably in the last half as consumer demand for large ticket items (such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture) slowed.
58492_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus 2009, with the earnings impact from higher unit volumes augmented by pricing discipline, significantly reduced bad debt expense, and a benefit associated with the sale of a building.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Commercial Fixturing Components Sales increased in 2010 due to relatively strong demand in our Store Fixtures business by value-oriented retailers, and improved market demand in Office Furniture Components.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	EBIT and EBIT margins also increased versus the prior year, largely due to higher sales.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	Industrial Materials 2010 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and improved market demand.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2009, as higher sales were more than offset by lower metal margins within the steel industry.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S4	Specialized Products Sales increased in 2010, reflecting improved demand across all the major businesses in the segment.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S5	EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales bolstered by cost reductions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S6	Results from Discontinued Operations Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased $5 million, from a loss of $6 million in 2009 to a loss of $1 million in 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P56_S7	This earnings increase was primarily due to the non-recurrence of $3 million (net of tax) of environmental charges related to an aluminum property and lower long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges associated with the divestitures (which were complete by late 2010).
58492_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	In this section, we provide details, reflecting both continuing and discontinued operations, about our:
58492_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	Debt position and total capitalization We use cash for the following:
58492_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Repurchase our stock Our operations provide most of the cash we require, but debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	For more than 20 years, our operations have provided more than sufficient cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments.
58492_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	In 2009, we generated the second highest level of cash from operations in our history, at $565 million, which included a significant reduction in working capital as sales contracted.
58492_12_ITEM7_P59_S3	With a slight increase in working capital in 2010 (due to sales growth), operating cash was $363 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P59_S4	In 2011, cash flow from operations decreased to $329 million, but still readily exceeded our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_12_ITEM7_P59_S5	We expect 2012 cash flow from operations to again exceed $300 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P59_S6	We ended 2011 with net debt to net capital of 29%, below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of 30%-40%.
58492_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Page 49 presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	Uses of Cash Finance Capital Requirements Improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be a key focus.
58492_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	However, cash is available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).
58492_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand manufacturing capacity.
58492_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The chart above shows that capital expenditures have been relatively stable in recent years, although well below levels of the previous decade.
58492_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	We expect capital expenditures to approximate $100 million in 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P61_S3	In all of our businesses, we continue to invest in the maintenance of facilities and equipment.
58492_12_ITEM7_P61_S4	However, with excess productive capacity across our operations (from continued low demand levels), we have reduced spending on expansion projects.
58492_12_ITEM7_P61_S5	The anticipated increase in 2012 relates primarily to specific new automotive programs that we have been awarded, and that should contribute to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2013.
58492_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	In 2008, we began assigning each Business Unit a specific role (e.g. Grow, Core, Fix, Divest) within our portfolio of businesses.
58492_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	This changed our long-term priorities for allocating capital and reduced capital spending levels.
58492_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	We actively pursue disciplined growth within our Grow business units and earmark expansion capital for these opportunities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Operations designated as Core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	We are seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	During the past few years, acquisitions were a lower priority as we primarily focused on completing the divestitures and improving margins and returns of our existing businesses.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	As a result, no significant acquisitions were completed in 2009, 2010, and 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	We recently turned our focus onto acquisitions and have begun actively soliciting opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S5	On December 20, 2011, we announced our plan to purchase, for $188 million, Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S6	With 2011 sales of $57 million, these operations will constitute a new, stand-alone business unit within our Industrial Materials segment.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S7	This acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets and that make sense to be a part of Leggett Platt.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S8	We completed the acquisition on January 12, 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P64_S9	Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 115.
58492_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	We expect to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
58492_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	In 2011 we modestly increased the quarterly dividend, to $.28 per share, and extended to 40 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound growth rate of 14%.
58492_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	Our targeted dividend payout is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, but actual payout has been higher recently and will likely remain above targeted levels in the near term.
58492_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_12_ITEM7_P65_S4	We anticipate spending approximately $160 million on dividends in 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P65_S5	Cash from operations has been, and is expected to continue to be, more than sufficient to readily fund both capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	During the past three years, we repurchased a total of 27 million shares of our stock (and issued 11 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans), reducing outstanding shares by 11%.
58492_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	In 2011, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average per-share price of $22.86.
58492_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	During the year, we issued 3 million shares through employee benefit plans (including shares that were purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation).
58492_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	For the past few years, we have made few acquisitions; instead, we used excess cash (including divestiture proceeds) largely to repurchase shares.
58492_12_ITEM7_P66_S4	With the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube, the amount of stock repurchased during 2012 will likely be significantly lower.
58492_12_ITEM7_P66_S5	Although no specific repurchase schedule has been established, we have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	PART II Cash from Operations Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	As shown in the chart below (and discussed in the paragraph that follows), most of the variability in cash from operations in recent years has come from changes in working capital.
58492_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	In 2011, cash from operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P68_S1	The decrease in 2010 operating cash (versus 2009) was due to the change in working capital levels (as shown in the chart above).
58492_12_ITEM7_P68_S2	Cash from operations in 2009 benefitted from a $186 million reduction in working capital that occurred as a result of the economy-induced sales contraction.
58492_12_ITEM7_P68_S3	The following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	(1) The accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net accounts receivable (net sales number of days in the year).
58492_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	(2) The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	(3) The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Accounts Receivable and Days Sales Outstanding (DSO): The dollar amount of accounts receivable increased from year-end 2010 levels, primarily due to inflation-driven sales increases.
58492_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	We continue to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts are paid on time.
58492_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	As part of our accounts receivable review process, we evaluate individual customers payment histories, financial health, industry prospects, and current macroeconomic events in determining if outstanding amounts are collectible.
58492_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	In 2011, we incurred $9 million of bad debt expense as compared to $7 million in 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	Changes in the DSO reflected in the table above are consistent with our historical range, and are not indicative of changes in payment trends or credit worthiness of customers.
58492_12_ITEM7_P72_S5	Instead, DSO fluctuates from year to year with normal differences in the timing of sales and cash receipts.
58492_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Inventory and Days Inventory on Hand (DIO):
58492_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Although the unit volume of our inventories was down from year-end 2010 levels, the dollar value of inventories increased slightly due to inflation in raw material costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	During 2011, we recognized expense of $10 million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories; in 2010 this expense totaled $13 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	We do not expect significant changes in customer or industry trends that would materially increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence.
58492_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	Our DIO typically fluctuates within a reasonably narrow range as a result of differences in the timing of sales, production levels, and inventory purchases.
58492_12_ITEM7_P74_S4	Our DIO decreased compared to the prior year due to lower unit volumes of inventory.
58492_12_ITEM7_P74_S5	This improvement reflects a continued focus on optimizing returns and a reduction of inventory in response to persistent demand weakness in certain markets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Accounts Payable and Days Payable Outstanding (DPO): The dollar value of accounts payable increased in 2011 primarily due to inflation in raw material costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	We actively strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors, and over the last few years, have increased our DPO by approximately ten days.
58492_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Changes in the DPO reflected in the table above are the result of normal fluctuation in our operating activity.
58492_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Working capital levels vary by segment.
58492_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	The Commercial Fixturing Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the Fixture Display group.
58492_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	This business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.
58492_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	PART II Capitalization This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	(1) These calculations include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	(2) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2011 and 2010, calculated in two ways:
58492_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.
58492_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $72 million in 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	During the year, we increased our commercial paper borrowings by $70 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	In anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in 2010.
58492_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	The swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 million of potential future debt issuance, and mature in August 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0%.
58492_12_ITEM7_P86_S3	They do not hedge the credit spread over treasuries, our credit worthiness, or the market price of credit related to any future debt issuances.
58492_12_ITEM7_P86_S4	For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 117.
58492_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Short Term Borrowings We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 13 lenders.
58492_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	This agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five-year term ending in 2016.
58492_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P87_S3	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_12_ITEM7_P87_S4	Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	PART II The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2011 was $118 million and $195 million, respectively.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $131 million and $174 million respectively.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	Commercial paper amounts fluctuated during the year due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $74 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S4	On January 10, 2012, we increased the amount of commercial paper outstanding to $341 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S5	These proceeds were used primarily to finance the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube (cash purchase price of $188 million), but also for ordinary working capital needs and other general purposes.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S6	With anticipated operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our expected ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, repurchase stock, and repay maturing debt.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S7	Accessibility of Cash At December 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of $236 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S8	A substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S9	Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S10	However, if we had to bring all the foreign cash back immediately, we could incur incremental taxes of up to $53 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S11	In 2010, we brought back $121 million of foreign cash at an incremental tax cost of $5 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P88_S12	In 2011, we brought back an additional $89 million through payments on intercompany loans at no added tax cost.
58492_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011:
58492_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	PART II CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM7_P94_S3	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	In the past three years, no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews.
58492_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	Margins, sales levels, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	Fair market values for one of the 10 reporting units (Fixture Display) exceeded book value by approximately 15%.
58492_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The goodwill associated with this reporting unit is $112 million, and is dependent on capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	Retailer activity was moderately lower in 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Fixture Display reporting unit did not meet expectations for 2011, but is expected to recover to forecasted earnings levels over the next two years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	If actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels, future goodwill impairments could be possible.
58492_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	The remaining reporting units have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than 30%, and have goodwill of $815 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C on page 86.
58492_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	Impairments were $35 million in 2011, $2 million in 2010, and $3 million in 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	The 2011 impairments were largely the result of lowered future business expectations at several underperforming locations that resulted in the decision to exit some unprofitable lines of business.
58492_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	Prior forecasts assumed a recovery in business levels (primarily housing related industries) that did not materialize.
58492_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	We have several operations that are dependent on the housing and retail industries that could also experience future impairments if these operations cash flows do not improve from current levels.
58492_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e. not selling very quickly).
58492_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	At December 31, 2011, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $39 million (approximately 7% of FIFO inventories).
58492_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	If we have more than a one-year s supply of a product, we value that inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover).
58492_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving.
58492_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Additions to inventory reserves in 2011 were $10 million, which was comparable to the previous year.
58492_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	These additions in 2011 were incurred generally among all segments and considered to be a normal level of obsolescence.
58492_12_ITEM7_P112_S2	We incurred write-downs of $2 million related to the 2011 restructuring plan.
58492_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay (since we are self-insured).
58492_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $11 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $2 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	At December 31, 2011, we had accrued $37 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	We expect worker compensation costs to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future.
58492_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	The average annual amount of customer-related credit losses was $11 million (less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	At December 31, 2011, our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled $23 million (about 5% of our accounts and customer-related notes receivable of $467 million).
58492_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	In 2011 and 2010, bad debt expense averaged $8 million, which is a return to more normal levels compared to 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	We did not experience any significant individual customer bankruptcies during the past two years.
58492_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	We believe the financial health of our major customers is stable, but some are highly leveraged, and this could cause circumstances to change in the future.
58492_12_ITEM7_P121_S3	We recognized an $11 million loss in 2009 related to the Aluminum divestiture note.
58492_12_ITEM7_P121_S4	At December 31, 2011, we had $20 million of non-customer notes outstanding, primarily related to divested businesses, and have recorded reserves of $3 million for these notes.
58492_12_ITEM7_P121_S5	Most of these notes are held by highly leveraged entities, which could result in the need for additional reserves in the future.
58492_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid, which also impacts current year pension expense.
58492_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	Determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities).
58492_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	The discount rates used to calculate the pension liability and pension expense for our most significant plans decreased approximately 85 basis points in 2011 due to lower corporate bond yields.
58492_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.4 million and increases the plans benefit obligation by $8.3 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	Other assumptions include rates of compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates, and retirement ages.
58492_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	These estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	The expected return on assets in 2011 decreased to 6.7%, compared to 6.8% in 2010 and 6.9% in 2009.
58492_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.5 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM7_P129_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_12_ITEM7_P129_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	We adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	Potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_12_ITEM7_P132_S1	If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed, we would incur additional taxes of approximately $53 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P132_S2	Tax audits by various taxing authorities are expected to increase as governments continue to look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_12_ITEM7_P132_S3	Based upon past experience, we do not expect any major changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $14 million and $13 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
58492_12_ITEM7_P133_S1	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_12_ITEM7_P133_S2	Valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a 50% probability of being realized.
58492_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	The recovery of net operating losses (NOL s) has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_12_ITEM7_P135_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_12_ITEM7_P136_S1	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred, we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss.
58492_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.
58492_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	We have several environmental clean-up activities related to current and closed facilities that mostly involve soil and groundwater contamination.
58492_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	Based upon facts available at this time, we believe reserves are adequate, however cost estimates could change as we determine more about the severity and cost of remediation.
58492_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in Note T on page 119.
58492_12_ITEM7_P139_S1	Over the past five years, the largest annual cost for litigation claims was $8 million (excluding legal fees).
58492_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	Historically, actual settlements have been reasonably close to original loss estimates.
58492_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	PART II CONTINGENCIES Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.
58492_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	NPI Lawsuit On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc. ( NPI ) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC ( Gamber ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements.
58492_12_ITEM7_P142_S1	NPI and Gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems.
58492_12_ITEM7_P142_S2	NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its alleged lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber s profits in an unspecified amount.
58492_12_ITEM7_P142_S3	Although part of the claims were dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 million in disgorgement damages against Gamber.
58492_12_ITEM7_P142_S4	On August 16, 2010, the Court: (a) reduced the jury verdict to approximately $0.5 million; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict.
58492_12_ITEM7_P142_S5	The Court subsequently awarded NPI $2.0 million in attorney fees and costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	On September 17, 2010, NPI filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_12_ITEM7_P143_S1	On September 7, 2011, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court s decision.
58492_12_ITEM7_P143_S2	Each party filed a request for rehearing en banc (a rehearing by the full court), which was denied on October 24, 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P143_S3	On November 22, 2011, our insurance carrier paid the judgment and attorney fee awards in full (roughly $2.5 million).
58492_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284 ( 2010 Suit ).
58492_12_ITEM7_P144_S1	The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 ( 2009 Suit ).
58492_12_ITEM7_P144_S2	The 2009 Suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff s failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders.
58492_12_ITEM7_P144_S3	As before, the plaintiff did not make such demand.
58492_12_ITEM7_P144_S4	On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice.
58492_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
58492_12_ITEM7_P145_S1	The briefing process began January 2012.
58492_12_ITEM7_P145_S2	We do not expect a ruling from the Court of Appeals for several months.
58492_12_ITEM7_P145_S3	The 2010 Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_12_ITEM7_P146_S1	The plaintiff was seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P146_S2	The plaintiff was not seeking monetary relief from us.
58492_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P147_S1	We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the 2010 Suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the Court s ruling in the 2009 Suit, this failure to make demand should not be excused; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the 2010 Suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_12_ITEM7_P147_S2	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_12_ITEM7_P147_S3	We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.
58492_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	December 6, 19 and 30, respectively.
58492_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	All of the pending U.S. cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-02196.
58492_12_ITEM7_P150_S1	In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_12_ITEM7_P150_S2	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim.
58492_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss.
58492_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P152_S1	Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.
58492_12_ITEM7_P152_S2	in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 and CV-11-17279.
58492_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 15 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100 million, punitive damages of $10 million, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the action.
58492_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	We have not yet filed our defenses in the Canadian actions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P153_S2	We deny all of the allegations in these actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	This contingency is subject to many uncertainties.
58492_12_ITEM7_P154_S1	Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.
58492_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	( L P Brazil ) in the amount of approximately $4 million, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innersprings in Brazil.
58492_12_ITEM7_P156_S1	The Brazilian Revenue Office has communicated that it will likely expand the audit to the tax years 2008 through January 2011.
58492_12_ITEM7_P156_S2	As a result, it is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation on the same subject matter.
58492_12_ITEM7_P156_S3	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.
58492_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	L P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking approximately $3.3 million for the tax years 2006 and 2007.
58492_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	The State of Sao Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on mattress innerspring sales in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_12_ITEM7_P157_S2	On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment.
58492_12_ITEM7_P157_S3	The State filed an appeal, which is currently pending.
58492_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	We deny all of the allegations in these actions.
58492_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_12_ITEM7_P158_S2	However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_12_ITEM7_P158_S3	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	Patent Infringement Claim On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 million based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-07416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S3	At trial, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 million.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S4	We disputed each patent s validity; the methodology used to calculate damages; and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S5	The plaintiff has also requested pre-judgment interest and royalties for future use of the machines and attorneys fees and costs.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S6	We intend to object to all of these claims.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S7	We intend to appeal the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and believe we have valid bases upon which to appeal.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S8	We do not believe that it is probable that the judgment will be upheld on appeal in its current form.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S9	We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011) challenging the validity of each patent at issue.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S10	The Patent Office ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of two of the three patents.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S11	With respect to the third patent, we intend to appeal the Patent Office s decision upholding validity; however, due to a change made to all of the machines we do not believe that the machines are currently using the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S12	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S13	We adopted new accounting guidance in 2011 as discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_12_ITEM7_P159_S14	The Financial Accounting Standards Board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	(Dollar amounts in millions) Interest Rates The table below provides information about the Company s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates.

58492_12_ITEM15_P7_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P8_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
58492_12_ITEM15_P9_S0	being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P10_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P10_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

58492_12_ITEM15_P16_S0	December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 A Summary of Significant Accounting Policies PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION:
58492_12_ITEM15_P17_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries ( we or our ).
58492_12_ITEM15_P18_S0	Prior to 2010, many subsidiaries outside of the United States were consolidated as of and for a fiscal year ended November 30.
58492_12_ITEM15_P18_S1	As of December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries converted to a calendar reporting year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P18_S2	The net impact of the change in fiscal years of these subsidiaries was immaterial, and is presented as an adjustment to January 1, 2010 retained earnings.
58492_12_ITEM15_P18_S3	Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States.
58492_12_ITEM15_P19_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_12_ITEM15_P20_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies.
58492_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	Legal costs are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
58492_12_ITEM15_P21_S1	If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable.
58492_12_ITEM15_P22_S1	Legal fees are accrued when incurred.
58492_12_ITEM15_P22_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
58492_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_12_ITEM15_P23_S1	ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_12_ITEM15_P23_S2	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a trade note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_12_ITEM15_P23_S3	Nontrade notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business.
58492_12_ITEM15_P23_S4	Notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	Interest income is not recognized for accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
58492_12_ITEM15_P27_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_12_ITEM15_P27_S2	The cost for approximately 60% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_12_ITEM15_P27_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P27_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory on a FIFO basis were as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	A business is classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_12_ITEM15_P29_S3	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P29_S4	Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_12_ITEM15_P31_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, in a held for use business, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Property is tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	Reporting units are business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.
58492_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group.
58492_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the business groups.
58492_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price-to-earnings ratios.
58492_12_ITEM15_P44_S2	Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, internal sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P44_S3	Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_12_ITEM15_P45_S2	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_12_ITEM15_P47_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_12_ITEM15_P47_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_12_ITEM15_P47_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers nor is it our practice to replace goods damaged or lost in transit.
58492_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_12_ITEM15_P55_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F.
58492_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Europe, China, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.
58492_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_12_ITEM15_P56_S3	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_12_ITEM15_P56_S4	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of noncustomer receivables.
58492_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Noncustomer receivables primarily consist of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business.
58492_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S3	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S4	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S5	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S6	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P63_S7	Derivatives are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value in Other current or Sundry assets or Other current or Other long-term liabilities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_12_ITEM15_P65_S2	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	Cash flow hedges are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Fair value hedges are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	The hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is designated as a net investment hedge.
58492_12_ITEM15_P69_S1	The effective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives, based upon spot rates, used as a net investment hedge of a foreign operation is recorded in other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.
58492_12_ITEM15_P69_S2	Any ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a net investment hedge is recorded as Other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	Net investment hedges are presented as investing cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2011 presentation:
58492_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	In the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Footnote I Non-current assets held for sale have been consolidated into Sundry assets, as all material divestiture activity is complete.
58492_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Activity related to the purchase and sale of short-term investments previously included in the Other line item within Investing Activities is now presented separately.
58492_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	Activities related to the acquisition of noncontrolling interest and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation previously included in the Other line item within Financing Activities are now presented separately.
58492_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	We adopted guidance issued in June 2011 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that removes the current presentation options for comprehensive income and requires presentation in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	Although the amendment is effective for first quarter 2012 reporting, we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011.
58492_12_ITEM15_P75_S2	As a result, the presentation for 2010 and 2009 has been retrospectively adjusted.
58492_12_ITEM15_P75_S3	Because the new guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income, its adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P75_S4	The FASB has issued other accounting guidance effective for current and future periods (that we have not yet adopted), but we do not believe any of the other new guidance will have a material impact on our current or future financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P75_S5	B Discontinued Operations We had no discontinued operations activity in 2011.
58492_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	The following divestitures were completed in 2010 and 2009 and were part of a broader strategic change that occurred in 2007.
58492_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	2010: Storage Products unit No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	2009: Coated Fabrics unit No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	The table below details the segments in which these operations were previously reported and includes activity related to these divestitures, as well as a small amount of subsequent activity directly related to divestitures completed prior to 2009:
58492_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	(1) Goodwill and other impairment charges were recorded to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as discussed in Note C.
58492_12_ITEM15_P80_S0	(2) 2009 activity was primarily related to the Aluminum Products segment that was divested in 2008, and represents charges for an environmental issue related to an aluminum property that was sold prior to the divestiture of this business.
58492_12_ITEM15_P80_S1	The Aluminum Products segment was sold in 2008 for $300.0 in cash, a $25.0 subordinated promissory note (fair value of $14.1), and shares of preferred stock (no book value, with face value not to exceed $25.0, dependent upon future performance of the divested business).
58492_12_ITEM15_P80_S2	In 2009, we learned that this business needed a capital infusion due to deterioration in business conditions and determined that the collectability of the promissory note was not reasonably assured.
58492_12_ITEM15_P80_S3	We recorded a $10.6 non-cash reduction in the value of the promissory note that is reported in Other expense (income), net on the Statements of Operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P80_S4	On June 30, 2009, we surrendered the promissory note, and in exchange, received $15.0 face amount (fair value of $3.5) of redeemable preferred stock.
58492_12_ITEM15_P81_S0	The fair value estimate incorporated various inputs related to the aluminum operations including: historical financial information, assumptions about future revenue, earnings, and cash flows and earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics.
58492_12_ITEM15_P82_S0	Management believes it was in our best interest to accept the preferred stock in exchange for the promissory note due to the higher likelihood of recovery resulting from the modification to the buyer s capital structure.
58492_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	C Impairment Charges Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.
58492_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	Asset impairments associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Other expense (income), net.
58492_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	Other Long-Lived Assets As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	In December 2011, management approved the 2011 Restructuring Plan which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming facilities and resulted in impairment charges of $31.2 ($19.0 for intangibles and $12.2 for fixed assets) during 2011 s fourth quarter.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S1	These impairment charges were largely the result of lowered expectations of future cash flows in certain operations, including those that produce fabricated wire components used in home appliances.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S2	We also incurred restructuring charges associated with this plan as discussed in Note D. Businesses Held for Sale In November 2007, we determined that we would exit certain of our business activities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S3	As presented in the table above, asset impairment charges were recorded as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell for the targeted divestitures became more certain.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S4	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S5	Goodwill Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year or as triggering events may occur.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S6	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year as discussed in Note A. Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S7	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S8	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_12_ITEM15_P85_S9	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years.
58492_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium.
58492_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_12_ITEM15_P86_S4	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_12_ITEM15_P86_S5	Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	The goodwill impairment reviews performed in each year presented indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	we concluded that a formal goodwill impairment review at December 31, 2011 was not necessary.
58492_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	Reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in these reviews are presented in the tables below.
58492_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.
58492_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	Reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values were:
58492_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	D Restructuring We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended December 31 were comprised of:
58492_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	In December 2011, we adopted the 2011 Restructuring Plan which included the closure of four underperforming manufacturing facilities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	The following table contains information, by segment, regarding the amount of each major type of restructuring-related cost incurred in connection with the exit activities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	The portion of the total restructuring charges in the above table that represents cash charges is $1.2.
58492_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	(1) Restructuring charges are reported on the Statements of Operations in Other expense (income), net.
58492_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	(2) Inventory obsolescence is reported in Cost of goods sold .
58492_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	The accrued liability associated with the 2011 Restructuring Plan consisted of the following: We also incurred impairment costs associated with this plan as discussed in Note C.
58492_12_ITEM15_P97_S2	We anticipate that these exit activities will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2012.
58492_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	Other Initiatives Apart from the 2011 Restructuring Plan, we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives over the last three years to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	None of these actions have individually resulted in a material charge to earnings.
58492_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	Total costs associated with these other initiatives have had the following impact on our financial statements: Restructuring and restructuring-related charges (income) associated with continuing operations by segment were as follows: The accrued liability associated with Other Initiatives consisted of the following:
58492_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	E Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:

58492_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	F Segment Information We have four operating segments that are generally focused on broad end-user markets for our diversified products:
58492_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	Specialized Products automotive seating components, specialized machinery and equipment, and commercial vehicle interiors Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_12_ITEM15_P102_S1	Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating decision maker.
58492_12_ITEM15_P102_S2	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_12_ITEM15_P102_S3	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory.
58492_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	We evaluate performance based on earnings from operations before interest and income taxes (EBIT).
58492_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices.
58492_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales and EBIT.
58492_12_ITEM15_P106_S2	These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.
58492_12_ITEM15_P106_S3	A summary of segment results for the periods presented are shown in the following tables.
58492_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance.
58492_12_ITEM15_P107_S1	These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	Segment assets for all years are reflected at their estimated average for the year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	Acquired companies long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.
58492_12_ITEM15_P109_S0	* Primarily goodwill, other intangibles, cash and long-term notes receivable.

58492_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	The geographic information that follows is based on the area of manufacture.
58492_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	G Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	H Accounts and Other Receivables Accounts and other receivables at December 31 consisted of the following: Notes are evaluated individually for impairment, and we had no significant impaired notes for the periods presented.
58492_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	Our investment in notes that were past due more than 90 days was less than $5.0 at December 31, 2011, of which approximately $4.0 had been placed on non-accrual status.
58492_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is reflected below:

58492_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	J Long-Term Debt Long-term debt, weighted average interest rates and due dates at December 31 are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 of commercial paper through a program backed by our five-year $600 revolving credit agreement dated August 19, 2011 with a syndicate of 13 lenders.
58492_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	Based on the information currently available to us, we believe the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement.
58492_12_ITEM15_P118_S2	The Company s ability to borrow under the 2011 Agreement is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the 2011 Agreement.
58492_12_ITEM15_P118_S3	The amount of letters of credit is limited to $250.
58492_12_ITEM15_P118_S4	The Company currently has no outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 Agreement.
58492_12_ITEM15_P118_S5	Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_12_ITEM15_P119_S0	* As discussed in Note U, the January 12, 2012 cash purchase price of $188 for Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC was financed with proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes under this program.
58492_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company may elect the type of borrowing under the 2011 Agreement, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance, as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	Under an ABR loan, the Company will pay interest at the Alternate Base Rate, which is the greater of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by JPMorgan; (b) the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus 1 / 2 of 1%; or (c) the rate appearing on Reuters Screen LIBOR01 for dollar deposits with one month maturity multiplied by a fraction (the numerator being 1, and the denominator being 1 minus the aggregate of the maximum reserve percentage to which JPMorgan is subject for eurocurrency funding) plus 1%.
58492_12_ITEM15_P122_S0	Under a Fixed Rate loan, the Company will pay interest at (a) the rate published on a designated reference page of the Reuters Group service (for the available currency and interest period chosen for the loan by the Company) equal to the rate published for deposits denominated in such currency with a maturity comparable to such interest period, plus (b) a fixed spread percentage (based upon the S P and Moody s ratings of the Company s senior unsecured debt).
58492_12_ITEM15_P123_S0	Under a Dollar Swingline loan (which is initially made by JPMorgan for short-term administrative convenience on same day notice) the Company will pay interest at a rate equal to the weighted average rate on overnight Federal funds transactions, plus 1.5%.
58492_12_ITEM15_P124_S0	Under a Competitive loan, the Company will pay interest at a rate equal to a competitive variable or fixed rate accepted by the Company.
58492_12_ITEM15_P124_S1	The Company is required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the 2011 Agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period.
58492_12_ITEM15_P124_S2	Any outstanding principal under the 2011 Agreement will be due upon the maturity date.
58492_12_ITEM15_P124_S3	The Company may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under the 2011 Agreement, in whole or in part, upon three business days notice.
58492_12_ITEM15_P125_S0	Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P126_S0	We lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets.
58492_12_ITEM15_P126_S1	Lease terms, including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs, vary by lease.
58492_12_ITEM15_P126_S2	Total rental expense for the periods presented was as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P126_S3	Future minimum rental commitments for all long-term non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: The above lease obligations expire at various dates through 2019.
58492_12_ITEM15_P126_S4	Aggregate rental commitments above include renewal amounts where it is our intention to renew the lease.
58492_12_ITEM15_P127_S0	We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.
58492_12_ITEM15_P128_S0	One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.
58492_12_ITEM15_P129_S0	Shares are issued from treasury for our stock plans activity.
58492_12_ITEM15_P129_S1	Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan.
58492_12_ITEM15_P129_S2	At December 31, 2011, the following shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:
58492_12_ITEM15_P130_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on the results of operations for each of the years ended December 31: When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a windfall tax benefit is created.
58492_12_ITEM15_P130_S1	The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital.
58492_12_ITEM15_P131_S0	When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax shortfall is created.
58492_12_ITEM15_P131_S1	To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital.
58492_12_ITEM15_P132_S0	(1) Stock Option Grants We grant stock options in the following areas:
58492_12_ITEM15_P133_S0	In conjunction with our Deferred Compensation Program Options granted to a broad group of employees on a discretionary basis We grant stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_12_ITEM15_P133_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months, 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P133_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_12_ITEM15_P133_S3	Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and will be amortized by the straight-line method over the options total vesting period, except for employees who terminate due to retirement.
58492_12_ITEM15_P134_S0	A retirement termination occurs if the employee is age 65, or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination.
58492_12_ITEM15_P134_S1	For retirement terminations, options continue to vest and remain exercisable for 3 years and 6 months after termination of employment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P134_S2	Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.
58492_12_ITEM15_P135_S0	Other employees participate in option choice programs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P135_S1	In connection with the January 2010 grant, we gave most participants the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options.
58492_12_ITEM15_P135_S2	The value of the cash alternative (paid in the first quarter) was equal to approximately one-half of the Black Scholes value of the option grant the employee would have otherwise received.
58492_12_ITEM15_P136_S0	In connection with the January 2011 grant, we offered two different option choice programs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P136_S1	One group of employees was offered the same option/cash choice as in 2010, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone.
58492_12_ITEM15_P136_S2	Another group of employees, generally higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of four options foregone for every one RSU offered.
58492_12_ITEM15_P136_S3	The stock units vest in one-third increments at 12 months, 24 months and 36 months after the date of grant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P137_S0	Deferred Compensation Program We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_12_ITEM15_P138_S0	Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_12_ITEM15_P138_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five, divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P138_S2	The option has a 10-year term.
58492_12_ITEM15_P138_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_12_ITEM15_P139_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_12_ITEM15_P140_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on the acquisition date and they vest immediately.
58492_12_ITEM15_P141_S0	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_12_ITEM15_P141_S1	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_12_ITEM15_P141_S2	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_12_ITEM15_P141_S3	Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.
58492_12_ITEM15_P141_S4	Beginning in 2010, stock units may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_12_ITEM15_P141_S5	Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.
58492_12_ITEM15_P142_S0	Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.
58492_12_ITEM15_P143_S0	STOCK OPTIONS SUMMARY Stock option information for the plans discussed above (including discontinued operations) for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P144_S0	Additional information related to stock option activity for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P145_S0	The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
58492_12_ITEM15_P146_S0	The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option.
58492_12_ITEM15_P147_S0	The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees.
58492_12_ITEM15_P148_S0	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility, measured daily for a time period equal to the option s expected life, ending on the day of grant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P148_S1	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P149_S0	(2) Stock-Based Retirement Plans We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_12_ITEM15_P149_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_12_ITEM15_P149_S2	In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.
58492_12_ITEM15_P150_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_12_ITEM15_P150_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P150_S2	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service.
58492_12_ITEM15_P151_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_12_ITEM15_P152_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_12_ITEM15_P152_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S0	Company contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S1	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S2	Beginning in 2010, units from the ESUP may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S3	The ESUP offered no diversification opportunity for contributions through March 31, 2011.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S4	Beginning April 1, 2011, participant contributions were credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we made premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S5	A participant s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S6	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units in these accounts.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S7	The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are a component of Other current assets and Sundry long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S8	Participant s diversified investment accounts are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company, and are presented as a component of Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet and will be settled in cash.
58492_12_ITEM15_P153_S9	Both the asset and liabilities associated with this program are presented in Note Q and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_12_ITEM15_P154_S0	Company matching contributions are in the form of stock units.
58492_12_ITEM15_P154_S1	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P154_S2	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.

58492_12_ITEM15_P156_S0	Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.
58492_12_ITEM15_P157_S0	(3) Performance Stock Unit Awards We also grant Performance Stock Unit (PSU) awards in the first quarter of each year to selected officers and other key managers.
58492_12_ITEM15_P157_S1	These awards contain the following conditions:
58492_12_ITEM15_P158_S0	Beginning Stock Price] as compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies.
58492_12_ITEM15_P159_S0	The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S P 500 and S P Midcap 400 (approximately 320 companies).
58492_12_ITEM15_P159_S1	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3-year performance period.
58492_12_ITEM15_P160_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies and are based upon assumptions similar to those used for stock options.
58492_12_ITEM15_P160_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three-year vesting period.
58492_12_ITEM15_P160_S2	Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU s for the periods presented:
58492_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	Beginning with the 2010 award (that will be settled in 2013), thirty-five percent (35%) of awards will be paid out in cash.
58492_12_ITEM15_P161_S1	We intend to pay out the remaining sixty-five percent (65%) in shares of our common stock, although we reserve the right to pay up to one hundred percent (100%) in cash.
58492_12_ITEM15_P161_S2	The 35% portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	(4) Restricted Stock Unit Awards RSU awards are generally granted as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P163_S0	As compensation for outside directors, who have a choice to receive RSUs or restricted stock The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.
58492_12_ITEM15_P164_S0	As discussed above, beginning in 2011 selected employees can elect to receive RSUs in lieu of option awards.
58492_12_ITEM15_P164_S1	STOCK UNITS SUMMARY Stock unit information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P165_S0	* PSU awards are presented at 175% (i.e. maximum) payout STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST NOT YET RECOGNIZED As of December 31, 2011, the unrecognized cost of non-vested stock options and units was as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P166_S0	(5) Discount Stock Plan Under the Discount Stock Plan (DSP), a tax-qualified 423 stock purchase plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of Leggett common stock at 85% of the closing market price on the last business day of each month.
58492_12_ITEM15_P166_S1	Shares are purchased and issued on the last business day of each month and generally cannot be sold or transferred for one year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P167_S0	M Employee Benefit Plans The accompanying balance sheets reflect an asset or liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
58492_12_ITEM15_P167_S1	Our most significant plans are in the U.S. and represent 88% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.
58492_12_ITEM15_P167_S2	A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P168_S0	Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below: Included in the above plans is a subsidiary s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.
58492_12_ITEM15_P168_S1	This is a non-qualified plan, and the subsidiary owns insurance policies for the participants that are not included in the plan s assets with cash surrender values at December 31 as follows: Comprehensive Income Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions is reflected below: Of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2011, the portions expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in 2012 are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	Net Pension (Expense) Income Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.
58492_12_ITEM15_P170_S1	We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points).
58492_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_12_ITEM15_P171_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	The table below presents the discount rate used for the benefit obligation for our most significant pension plans.
58492_12_ITEM15_P172_S1	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings, as discussed below.
58492_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P179_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows: Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_12_ITEM15_P179_S2	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P179_S3	In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_12_ITEM15_P179_S4	Approximately 60% of our significant plans (the frozen plans) are employing a Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% bonds and 40% equities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P179_S5	The remaining significant plans (the active plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% bonds, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to six different investments: four mutual funds and two separate accounts.
58492_12_ITEM15_P180_S1	The mutual funds, all passively managed low-cost index funds, include:
58492_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	Total Stock Market Index: Large, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles; using index sampling.
58492_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world; using index sampling.
58492_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market; index sampling.
58492_12_ITEM15_P184_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market; using index sampling.
58492_12_ITEM15_P184_S1	The separate accounts are invested as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P185_S0	Small cap U.S. equities: Portfolio of small capitalization U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2000 Value Index.
58492_12_ITEM15_P186_S0	U.S. equities: Broad portfolio of U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index.
58492_12_ITEM15_P187_S0	Future Contributions and Benefit Payments We expect to contribute $7 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012.
58492_12_ITEM15_P187_S1	Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P187_S2	Other Benefit Plans Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows: We have limited participation in one union sponsored, defined benefit, multiemployer pension plan.
58492_12_ITEM15_P187_S3	This plan is not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_12_ITEM15_P187_S4	Contributions to this plan were less than $.1 for each of the years presented, and we do not believe there is a material withdrawal liability associated with this plan.
58492_12_ITEM15_P188_S0	The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P189_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
58492_12_ITEM15_P190_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P191_S0	In 2011, 2010, and 2009 the tax rate benefitted from income earned in certain foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate.
58492_12_ITEM15_P191_S1	In 2011, the tax rate also benefitted from the release of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax audit settlements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S0	In 2009, tax law changes in Mexico caused us to re-evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S1	As a result of our analysis, we recorded a $6.0 tax charge to earnings related to current and prior year tax losses that may expire before they can be utilized.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S2	We recognized net excess tax benefits of approximately $6.1, $0.1, and $1.4 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to stock plan activity, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S3	These amounts include net windfall tax benefits as discussed in Note L. We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S4	In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S5	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S6	In addition, we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S7	The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011, is $34.8, of which $21.4 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_12_ITEM15_P192_S8	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P193_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_12_ITEM15_P194_S0	As of December 31, 2011, three tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2009 through 2011.
58492_12_ITEM15_P194_S1	In 2011, IRS examinations of the 2004 through 2008 tax returns were completed, and a final audit report was issued.
58492_12_ITEM15_P194_S2	We are now waiting on review and final sign-off by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
58492_12_ITEM15_P194_S3	Refunds aggregating $15.6 are expected for all years associated with the audit.
58492_12_ITEM15_P194_S4	In addition, in 2011 we adjusted our reserve for uncertain tax positions with respect to the largest issue in connection with this examination, related to worthless stock deductions, which had a favorable impact on our tax provision of $3.6.
58492_12_ITEM15_P195_S0	Five tax years were undergoing (or subject to) audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2005 through 2009.
58492_12_ITEM15_P195_S1	Examinations are in progress for each of these years and are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments.
58492_12_ITEM15_P195_S2	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination as well, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P195_S3	We are not aware of any changes that would materially impact our tax expense for an increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
58492_12_ITEM15_P196_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P196_S1	The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P197_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_12_ITEM15_P197_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_12_ITEM15_P197_S2	These loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, but no significant amounts expire in any one year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P198_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_12_ITEM15_P199_S0	The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.
58492_12_ITEM15_P200_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested.
58492_12_ITEM15_P200_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2011, which are indefinitely reinvested, are approximately $270.9.
58492_12_ITEM15_P200_S2	If such earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental taxes would be approximately $53.2 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.
58492_12_ITEM15_P201_S0	In 2010, we repatriated $108 of foreign earnings, resulting in a net tax charge of $4.7.
58492_12_ITEM15_P202_S0	Deferred tax assets and (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P203_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_12_ITEM15_P204_S0	Q Fair Value We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P204_S1	The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets for potential impairment as discussed in Notes B and C. The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.
58492_12_ITEM15_P205_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_12_ITEM15_P206_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_12_ITEM15_P207_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_12_ITEM15_P207_S1	Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_12_ITEM15_P207_S2	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_12_ITEM15_P207_S3	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_12_ITEM15_P207_S4	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_12_ITEM15_P208_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_12_ITEM15_P209_S0	The following tables present assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
58492_12_ITEM15_P210_S0	The fair value for fixed rate debt was greater than its $730 carrying value by $29.2 at December 31, 2011 and greater than its $730 carrying value by $6.0 at December 31, 2010.
58492_12_ITEM15_P210_S1	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions:
58492_12_ITEM15_P211_S0	See the table below for acquisitions during the periods presented.
58492_12_ITEM15_P212_S0	We are finalizing all the information required to complete purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_12_ITEM15_P213_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_12_ITEM15_P213_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2011 and 2010 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P214_S0	Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash, at a later date and, are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date.
58492_12_ITEM15_P214_S1	At December 31, 2011, there is no substantial remaining consideration payable.
58492_12_ITEM15_P214_S2	We also increased our ownership portion to 100% in the following businesses that were previously not wholly owned:
58492_12_ITEM15_P215_S0	S Derivative Financial Instruments Risk Management Strategy Objectives We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P215_S1	In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks.
58492_12_ITEM15_P215_S2	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P215_S3	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_12_ITEM15_P215_S4	We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments for the periods presented below.
58492_12_ITEM15_P215_S5	The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.
58492_12_ITEM15_P216_S0	Cash Flow Hedges Derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:
58492_12_ITEM15_P217_S0	The commodity cash flow hedges manage natural gas commodity price risk.
58492_12_ITEM15_P217_S1	All commodity hedges at December 31, 2011 had maturities of less than two years.
58492_12_ITEM15_P217_S2	We routinely hedge commodity price risk up to 36 months.
58492_12_ITEM15_P218_S0	The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_12_ITEM15_P218_S1	The foreign currency cash flow hedges outstanding at December 31, 2011 had maturity dates within one year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P218_S2	In general, foreign currency cash flow hedges have maturities within two years.
58492_12_ITEM15_P219_S0	In anticipation of long-term debt maturing in April 2013, we entered into forward starting interest swaps in 2010.
58492_12_ITEM15_P219_S1	The swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with $200 of planned debt issuance in August 2012.
58492_12_ITEM15_P219_S2	The swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 4.0% and hedge the benchmark rate of an expected issuance of $200 of debt.
58492_12_ITEM15_P219_S3	The credit spread over the benchmark bonds will continue to fluctuate until the time of issuance.
58492_12_ITEM15_P219_S4	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_12_ITEM15_P220_S0	Our fair value hedges manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries inter-company assets and liabilities.
58492_12_ITEM15_P220_S1	Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings and are presented as operating cash flows when the contracts are settled.
58492_12_ITEM15_P220_S2	These fair value hedges generally have a maturity date within one year.
58492_12_ITEM15_P221_S0	Hedge Effectiveness We have deemed all ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness.
58492_12_ITEM15_P221_S1	If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated condensed statements of operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P222_S0	Derivatives Not Qualifying for Hedge Accounting Treatment At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had derivative transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P222_S1	Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded directly to income and expense in the period impacted, and offset the majority of gains and losses on the underlying Euro inter-company debt.
58492_12_ITEM15_P222_S2	The following table sets forth the pre-tax gains (losses) from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented.
58492_12_ITEM15_P223_S0	This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.
58492_12_ITEM15_P224_S0	T Contingencies We are a defendant in various proceedings involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
58492_12_ITEM15_P224_S1	When it is probable, in management s judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_12_ITEM15_P224_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings, and the total liabilities recorded are not material to our financial position.
58492_12_ITEM15_P225_S0	NPI Lawsuit On January 18, 2008, National Products, Inc. ( NPI ) sued Gamber-Johnson, LLC ( Gamber ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, in Case C08-0049C-JLR, in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, alleging that portions of a Gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements.
58492_12_ITEM15_P225_S1	NPI and Gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems.
58492_12_ITEM15_P225_S2	NPI sought: (a) injunctive relief requiring Gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers; (b) damages for its alleged lost profits; and (c) disgorgement of Gamber s profits in an unspecified amount.
58492_12_ITEM15_P225_S3	Although part of the claims were dismissed by the Court before and during trial, a jury, on April 12, 2010, found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded $10 in disgorgement damages against Gamber.
58492_12_ITEM15_P225_S4	On August 16, 2010, the Court: (a) reduced the jury verdict to approximately $0.5; (b) granted NPI attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined; and (c) granted an injunction requiring Gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict.
58492_12_ITEM15_P225_S5	The Court subsequently awarded NPI $2.0 in attorney fees and costs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P226_S0	On September 17, 2010, NPI filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_12_ITEM15_P226_S1	On September 7, 2011, a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court s decision.
58492_12_ITEM15_P226_S2	Each party filed a request for rehearing en banc (a rehearing by the full court), which was denied on October 24, 2011.
58492_12_ITEM15_P226_S3	On November 22, 2011, our insurance carrier paid the judgment and attorney fee awards in full (roughly $2.5).
58492_12_ITEM15_P227_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC00284 ( 2010 Suit ).
58492_12_ITEM15_P227_S1	The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 ( 2009 Suit ).
58492_12_ITEM15_P227_S2	The 2009 Suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff s failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders.
58492_12_ITEM15_P227_S3	As before, the plaintiff did not make such demand.
58492_12_ITEM15_P227_S4	On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice.
58492_12_ITEM15_P228_S0	On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
58492_12_ITEM15_P228_S1	The briefing process began January 2012.
58492_12_ITEM15_P228_S2	We do not expect a ruling from the Court of Appeals for several months.
58492_12_ITEM15_P228_S3	The 2010 Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_12_ITEM15_P228_S4	The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_12_ITEM15_P228_S5	The plaintiff was seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P228_S6	The plaintiff was not seeking monetary relief from us.
58492_12_ITEM15_P229_S0	We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P230_S0	prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_12_ITEM15_P230_S1	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_12_ITEM15_P230_S2	We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P231_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_12_ITEM15_P231_S1	A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice.
58492_12_ITEM15_P231_S2	Of the U.S. cases remaining, we have been named as a defendant in (a) three direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) and a consolidated amended class action complaint filed on February 28, 2011 on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products; (b) an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 (although the underlying lawsuits do not name us as a defendant); and an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011; and (c) eleven individual direct purchaser cases, one filed March 22, 2011, another amended August 24, 2011 to remove class allegations, one amended August 25, 2011 to name us as a defendant, four others filed October 31, 2011, one filed November 4, 2011 and three filed December 6, 19 and 30, respectively.
58492_12_ITEM15_P231_S3	All of the pending U.S. cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-02196.
58492_12_ITEM15_P231_S4	In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_12_ITEM15_P231_S5	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P232_S0	On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim.
58492_12_ITEM15_P232_S1	On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss.
58492_12_ITEM15_P233_S0	Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P233_S1	Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.
58492_12_ITEM15_P233_S2	in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 and CV-11-17279.
58492_12_ITEM15_P234_S0	In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 15 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100, punitive damages of $10, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the action.
58492_12_ITEM15_P234_S1	We have not yet filed our defenses in the Canadian actions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P234_S2	We deny all of the allegations in these actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_12_ITEM15_P235_S0	This contingency is subject to many uncertainties.
58492_12_ITEM15_P235_S1	Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.
58492_12_ITEM15_P236_S0	Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_12_ITEM15_P237_S0	approximately $4, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_12_ITEM15_P238_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innersprings in Brazil.
58492_12_ITEM15_P238_S1	The Brazilian Revenue Office has communicated that it will likely expand the audit to the tax years 2008 through January 2011.
58492_12_ITEM15_P238_S2	As a result, it is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation on the same subject matter.
58492_12_ITEM15_P238_S3	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S0	L P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking approximately $3.3 for the tax years 2006 and 2007.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S1	The State of Sao Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on mattress innerspring sales in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S2	On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S3	The State filed an appeal, which is currently pending.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S4	We deny all of the allegations in these actions.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S5	We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S6	However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_12_ITEM15_P239_S7	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P240_S0	Patent Infringement Claim On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P240_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-07416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_12_ITEM15_P240_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S0	At trial, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S1	We disputed each patent s validity; the methodology used to calculate damages; and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S2	The plaintiff has also requested pre-judgment interest and royalties for future use of the machines and attorneys fees and costs.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S3	We intend to object to all of these claims.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S4	We intend to appeal the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and believe we have valid bases upon which to appeal.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S5	We do not believe that it is probable that the judgment will be upheld on appeal in its current form.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S6	We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S7	The Patent Office ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of two of the three patents.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S8	With respect to the third patent, we intend to appeal the Patent Office s decision upholding validity; however, due to a change made to all of the machines we do not believe that the machines are currently using the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.
58492_12_ITEM15_P241_S9	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_12_ITEM15_P242_S0	On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC ( Western ).

58492_12_ITEM15_P311_S0	Life Insurance and Disability Benefits To the extent the level of benefits is based upon a Participant s compensation, Deferred Compensation will be included when it would have otherwise become payable but for the deferral.
58492_12_ITEM15_P311_S1	Except as provided in Section 6.1, the Participant must make contributions and payments under all Employer benefit plans in which he is participating in the amounts required as if no deferral had occurred.
58492_12_ITEM15_P311_S2	If there is not sufficient Compensation after deferral from which to withhold required contributions and payments, the Participant must make arrangements suitable to the Company for payment of the required amounts.

58492_12_ITEM15_P317_S4	To the extent permitted by Section 409A, the Committee retains the right to delay a Participant distribution if the payment of such distribution would violate securities laws, eliminate or reduce the Company s tax deduction by application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, violate loan covenants or other contractual terms to which the Company is a party, or otherwise result in material harm to the Company.

58492_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores, automobiles and commercial aircraft.
58492_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	As discussed below, our operations are organized into 20 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.
58492_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.
58492_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves.
58492_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.
58492_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Residential Furnishings groups include:
58492_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Most of our Residential Furnishings customers are manufacturers of finished bedding products (mattresses and foundations) or upholstered furniture for residential use.
58492_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	We also sell many products, including ornamental beds, bed frames, adjustable beds, carpet underlay, and top-of-bed accessories, directly to retailers and distributors.
58492_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	We sell Geo Components products primarily to dealers, contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies.
58492_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our Store Fixtures group designs, produces, installs and manages our customers store fixtures projects.
58492_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Our Office Furniture Components group designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of engineered components targeted for the office seating market.
58492_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Commercial Fixturing Components groups include:
58492_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Customers of the Commercial Fixturing Components segment include:
58492_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe that the quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing.
58492_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	We have four wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	Our Steel Tubing business unit also supplies nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing.
58492_13_ITEM1_P9_S4	In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.
58492_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western).
58492_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.
58492_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 104 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Industrial Materials groups include:
58492_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	We use about half of our wire output and about one-quarter of our steel tubing output to manufacture our own products.
58492_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	For example, we use our wire and steel tubing to make:
58492_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Industrial Materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers, including:
58492_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, produces and sells components for automotive seating, specialized machinery and equipment, and service van interiors.
58492_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	development have made us a leader in innovation.
58492_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	We also benefit from our broad geographic presence and our internal production of key raw materials and components.
58492_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Specialized Products groups include:
58492_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our primary customers for the Specialized Products segment include:
58492_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price).
58492_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S P 500 over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S P 500) on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2012 we generated TSR of 16% per year, on average, which places us in the top 37% of the S P 500.
58492_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	In addition, our TSR has exceeded that of the S P 500 index for five consecutive years.
58492_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our incentive programs reward return generation.
58492_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control.
58492_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	During the past three years, we generated $1.14 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
58492_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR.
58492_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Since late 2007, we have raised quarterly dividends by 61%, from $.18 per share to $.29 per share currently.
58492_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	Our dividend payout target is 50-60% of earnings; however we have been above that target in recent years.
58492_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Our dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) was 92%,106% and 67% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
58492_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	As our markets recover, we expect to move back into our target payout range.
58492_13_ITEM1_P24_S4	In the meantime, we expect to generate enough cash to continue to pay and modestly grow the dividend.
58492_13_ITEM1_P24_S5	The Company has consistently (for over 20 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	We expect to use cash (after funding capital expenditures, dividends, and growth opportunities) for share repurchases.
58492_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	During the past three years, we have repurchased 18.3 million shares of our stock (and issued 11.6 million shares through employee benefit plans), which reduced the net outstanding shares by 4.5%.
58492_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	In 2012, we repurchased 2.0 million shares (which includes shares withheld for taxes in option exercises and stock unit conversions; and forfeited stock units) at an average per share price of $25.35 (and issued 4.7 million shares through employee benefit plans).
58492_13_ITEM1_P25_S3	As discussed in more detail below under Acquisitions, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million in January 2012.
58492_13_ITEM1_P25_S4	As such, the level of share repurchases was lower in 2012 than in recent years and our shares outstanding rose by 2% to roughly 142 million at year-end.
58492_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest).
58492_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), operating cash flows, and return on assets.
58492_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets.
58492_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually.
58492_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity.
58492_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions.
58492_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.
58492_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	We seek acquisitions within our growth businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	competitive advantage, and a strong fit with the Company; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return and have an internal rate of return in excess of 10%; (c) for stand-alone companies: generally, revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on companies: generally, revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
58492_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	In January 2012, we acquired for a cash purchase price of $188 million, Western Pneumatic Tube, which produces thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products for aerospace applications.
58492_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Western fabricates products from specialty materials, such as titanium, nickel, stainless steel, and other high strength metals for use in aircraft systems and aircraft engine systems, including fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, life support, stability, and cooling systems.
58492_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Western operates two facilities, one in Kirkland, Washington, and another in Poway, California, and is part of our Industrial Materials segment.
58492_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 104 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	We had no significant acquisitions in 2010 and 2011.
58492_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	There were no significant divestitures in 2011 or 2012.
58492_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment) in the third quarter of 2010.
58492_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit.
58492_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.
58492_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	This unit sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and health care industries.
58492_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 75 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 80 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	The percentages of our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our international operations are principally located in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.
58492_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	The products we make in these countries primarily consist of:
58492_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for components is growing.
58492_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.
58492_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 75% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	We have manufacturing facilities in countries around the world, as shown below.
58492_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	For further information concerning our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 80 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	The following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales by classes of similar products for the last three years:
58492_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel.
58492_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
58492_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials.
58492_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	We supply the majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.
58492_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	In 2012, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues.
58492_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 24% of these consolidated revenues.
58492_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing Components and Specialized Products segments.
58492_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2012.
58492_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
58492_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.
58492_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities.
58492_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	However, we estimate the cost of research and development to be approximately $20 million per year in each of the last three years.
58492_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 18,300 employees, of which roughly 12,900 were engaged in production.
58492_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	Of the 18,300, approximately 8,600 were international employees (5,000 in China).
58492_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	Labor unions represented roughly 14% of our employees.
58492_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2012.
58492_13_ITEM1_P57_S4	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2013.
58492_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.
58492_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 18,300 employees.
58492_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-15%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	We expect these products to continue to grow.
58492_13_ITEM1_P64_S3	Some of our traditional bedding customers are now offering mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel.
58492_13_ITEM1_P64_S4	These hybrid products, which allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring, are being well received by consumers.
58492_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	Since early 2009, there have been antidumping duty rates on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	These rates are expected to remain in effect at least until early 2014.
58492_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin.
58492_13_ITEM1_P65_S3	Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses.
58492_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.
58492_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	Residential Furnishings: typically does not exhibit any significant seasonality, except for a reduction in fourth quarter sales.
58492_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Commercial Fixturing Components: generally has modestly stronger third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the fourth quarter significantly lower.
58492_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	This aligns with the retail industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.
58492_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	Industrial Materials: minimal variation in sales throughout the year.
58492_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Specialized Products: relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.
58492_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_13_ITEM1_P72_S1	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of Cash from Operations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 39.
58492_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from Government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any Government.
58492_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_13_ITEM1_P75_S2	While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section.
58492_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
58492_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	In addition to these reports, the Company s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section.
58492_13_ITEM1_P76_S3	Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
58492_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Two of our prior businesses (the Storage Products business unit, which was previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment and the Prime Foam Products business unit, which was previously reported in the Residential Furnishing segment) are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses.
58492_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	We divested the Storage Products business unit in the third quarter of 2010.
58492_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit.
58492_13_ITEM1_P78_S2	Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.
58492_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	This unit sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and health care industries.
58492_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	During the second quarter of 2012, we received a cash litigation settlement of $3.9 million related to our former Prime Foam Products unit, which was sold in March 2007.
58492_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	This business unit produced foam primarily used for cushioning by upholstered furniture and bedding manufacturers.
58492_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	For further information on these discontinued operations, see Note B on page 75 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves risk.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flow and earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, energy costs and interest rates.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our products.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Many consumers continue to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs move with the market.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If scrap costs raise more rapidly than the price of steel rod, the metal margins within our rod producing operation will be compressed.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Compressed metal margins could negatively impact our result of operations.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-15%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If sales of foam or air core mattresses continue to grow appreciably, it could reduce our market share in the U.S. bedding market, and negatively impact our sales and earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	At December 31, 2012, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $1.2 billion, or approximately 37% of our total assets.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled approximately $718 million, or approximately 22% of total assets.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2012 indicated no goodwill impairments, but fair market value for one of our ten reporting units (Store Fixtures) only exceeded book value by approximately 10%.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The fair market values of all other reporting units exceeded book value by more than 35%.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	The goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures reporting unit was $111 million at December 31, 2012.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The unit is dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although recent performance has met expectations, the predictability of future results is less certain than that of our other reporting units due to the project nature of this business.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If we are not able to maintain current performance levels, future impairments could be possible.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In 2012, 27% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of, and collections from, our customers, and manage the accounting for, and payment to, our vendors.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	New conflict minerals regulations may adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of conflict minerals or components which contain conflict minerals, and may result in loss of sales, additional expenses and reduced profitability.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	On August 22, 2012, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted new disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold, known as conflict minerals, if these minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of the company's products.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These regulations require such issuers to report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and in some cases to perform extensive due diligence on their supply chains for such minerals.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of certain electronic components, including those assembled into our products.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, we may incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Since our supply chain is complex, the due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are DRC conflict-free, which may harm our reputation.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict-free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of sales.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S6	These new requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our sales, earnings, cash flows and liquidity.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We serve customers in a variety of industries, some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	A sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers, or a group of less significant customers, could become insolvent, which could adversely impact our sales, earnings, cash flow and liquidity.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri.
58492_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	We currently have 135 manufacturing locations, of which 91 are located across the United States and 44 are located in 16 foreign countries.
58492_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Manufacturing locations that we own produced approximately 70% of our sales in 2012.
58492_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 88 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	In the opinion of management the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_13_ITEM2_P2_S3	With our current utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate over $4 billion in revenue (assuming current sales mix).
58492_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	To trim unproductive capacity and reduce overhead costs, management, in December 2011, approved a restructuring plan which included the closure of four underperforming branches.
58492_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	Of the closed branches, one was in the Residential Furnishings segment, one was in Commercial Fixturing Components and two were in the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	The information in Note T on page 108 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.
58492_13_ITEM4_P0_S0	The following information is included in accordance with the provisions of Part III, Item 10 of Form 10-K and Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.
58492_13_ITEM4_P1_S0	The table below sets forth the names, ages and positions of all executive officers of the Company.

58492_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol LEG).
58492_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below highlights quarterly and annual stock market information for the last two years.
58492_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Price and volume data reflect composite transactions; price range reflects intra-day prices; data source is Bloomberg.
58492_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 11, 2013, we had 9,533 shareholders of record.
58492_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	We expect to continue to pay dividends on our common stock and we are targeting a dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) of 50-60%, though it has been and will likely be higher for the near term.
58492_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	Our dividend payout ratio was 92%, 106% and 67% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
58492_13_ITEM5_P4_S2	See the discussion of the Company s targeted dividend payout under Pay Dividends in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 38.
58492_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	During 2012, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five of them, given its decision to accelerate the first quarter 2013 dividend payment into December 2012.
58492_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	For 2013, the Company expects to return to its typical dividend schedule, which is to declare four dividend payments.
58492_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	However, during 2013, we expect to pay only three dividends with the fourth payment to be made in January 2014.
58492_13_ITEM5_P5_S3	The five dividend payments in 2012 utilized approximately $200 million of cash while the three expected payments in 2013 are anticipated to utilize roughly $125 million of cash.
58492_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	The table below is a listing of our purchases of the Company s common stock during each calendar month of the fourth quarter of 2012.
58492_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	(1) This number includes 510,619 shares which were not repurchased as part of a publicly announced plan or program, all of which were shares surrendered in transactions permitted under the Company s benefit plans.
58492_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	It does not include shares withheld for taxes in option exercises and stock unit conversions; or forfeited stock units during the quarter.
58492_13_ITEM5_P7_S2	(2) On August 4, 2004, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year beginning January 1, 2005.
58492_13_ITEM5_P7_S3	This standing authorization was first reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, filed August 5, 2004, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors.
58492_13_ITEM5_P7_S4	As such, effective January 1, 2013, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2013.
58492_13_ITEM5_P7_S5	No specific repurchase schedule has been established.
58492_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	Net earnings for 2012 include a $33 million net tax benefit primarily related to the release of valuation allowances on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by deferred withholding taxes on earnings in China.
58492_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	The Company incurred asset impairment charges and restructuring-related charges totaling $44 million in 2011.
58492_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	All of these charges were recognized in continuing operations.
58492_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	The Company incurred asset impairment and restructuring-related charges totaling $84 million in 2008.
58492_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	Of these charges, approximately $33 million were associated with continuing operations and $51 million related to discontinued operations.
58492_13_ITEM6_P2_S2	Amounts for 2008 were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of noncontrolling interests from Other expense (income), net to (Earnings) attributable to noncontrolling interest, net of tax in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Demand continued to improve in several of our markets during 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Sales grew in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Adjustable Bed, Geo Components, Carpet Underlay, and parts of our home furniture components business.
58492_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Growth in unit volumes was partially offset by lower trade sales at our steel mill and changes in currency rates.
58492_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Higher unit volumes led to improved earnings and record earnings per share from continuing operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Earnings also benefited from cost improvements and the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.
58492_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	In January 2012 we purchased Western Pneumatic Tube, a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems.
58492_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	This was our first significant acquisition since 2007, and established for us a strong competitive position in a higher return, higher growth market.
58492_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Operating cash for the full year increased significantly on stronger earnings and improvements in working capital levels.
58492_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	We again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 20 years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	2012 marked the 41st consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period.
58492_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Only two other S P 500 companies can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	We ended 2012 with net debt to net capital slightly below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range.
58492_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	In August we issued $300 million of 10-year senior notes and used the proceeds to pay down commercial paper.
58492_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	We ended the year with the entire $600 million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility.
58492_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	We target TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long term.
58492_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	For the three years ended December 31, 2012, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average.
58492_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	That places us in the top 37% of the S P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.
58492_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price].
58492_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	We seek to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S P 500) on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2012, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, compared to 11% for the S P 500 index.
58492_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	That places us in the top 37% of the S P 500, just shy of our top one-third goal.
58492_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Our incentive programs reward improved return on investment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control.
58492_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 6% of our sales.
58492_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	All these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Demand improved in several of our markets during 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	As expected, we realized significant earnings leverage as unit volumes grew, and this led to improved margins.
58492_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Over the last few years we have significantly reduced our fixed cost structure, but purposely retained spare production capacity.
58492_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Accordingly, unit sales can increase appreciably without the need for large capital investment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	We have meaningful operating leverage that should further benefit earnings as market demand continues to improve.
58492_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	With our current utilization levels, we should be able to readily accommodate over $4 billion in revenue (assuming current sales mix).
58492_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	Until our spare capacity is fully utilized, each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume is expected to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	This purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have.
58492_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.
58492_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	In late 2010, steel costs began increasing, and we raised our selling prices in early 2011 to recover the majority of the higher costs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	By mid-year 2011, market prices for certain types of steel had begun to decrease.
58492_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	The margin pressure we experienced in the last half of 2011 resulted in part from lowering our selling prices (selectively) in advance of our average cost of steel declining, in order to maintain market share and minimize deterioration in product mix.
58492_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	The alignment of costs and pricing improved in 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	During the year, we experienced month-to-month variability in steel costs, but overall for 2012, costs decreased slightly.
58492_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	Steel scrap costs (and metal margins) were relatively stable for the majority of 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	As mentioned above, in 2012 we experienced month-to-month variability in steel scrap costs and steel rod pricing, however for the full year, metal margins were comparable to 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	We experienced this de-contenting effect in our Residential Furnishings segment in the back half of 2011 (however selective selling price reductions helped contain this activity).
58492_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	As our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address commodity inflation, our profit margins were negatively impacted.
58492_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	We must continue to find ways to assist our customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.
58492_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	The margin pressure we experienced in the last half of 2011 resulted in part from price competition in certain of our businesses as we reduced prices (selectively) to maintain market share in light of depressed industry volume.
58492_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-15%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	We expect these products to continue to grow.
58492_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Some of our traditional bedding customers are now offering mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel.
58492_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	These hybrid products, which allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring, are being well received by consumers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	We filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam which was brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009.
58492_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014.
58492_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin.
58492_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	In 2009, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	In December 2011, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our overhead costs and improve ongoing profitability.
58492_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The activities primarily entailed the closure of four underperforming facilities.
58492_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	We incurred a $37 million pre-tax (largely non-cash) charge in the 4 th quarter of 2011 primarily related to this plan, which included $31 million of long-lived asset impairments and $6 million of other restructuring-related costs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	During 2012, we incurred an additional $2 million of restructuring-related costs and $1 million of long-lived asset impairments related to this plan.
58492_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	These activities were substantially complete by the end of 2012 and no significant additional costs related to the plan are expected.
58492_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	Demand improved in many of our markets during 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Growth in unit volumes was partially offset by lower trade sales at our steel mill (sales shifted from trade to intra-segment) and changes in currency rates.
58492_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Earnings increased significantly, from $153 million in 2011 to $248 million in 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	This improvement reflects several factors, including lower restructuring-related costs, higher unit volumes, benefits from special tax items, cost improvements, and earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.
58492_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2012, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Improved demand in several of our markets led to higher sales in 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Same location sales increased 1%, with 3% unit volume growth partially offset by a 2% revenue decline from lower trade sales at our steel mill and changes in currency rates.
58492_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	Unit volumes grew during the year in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Adjustable Bed, Geo Components, Carpet Underlay, and certain parts of our home furniture components business.
58492_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2012 was largely offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Earnings increased significantly in 2012 due to several factors.
58492_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Operationally, these included higher unit volumes, cost improvements, and earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.
58492_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	The other items detailed in the table above also collectively contributed to the earnings increase.
58492_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	In 2011, earnings were reduced by restructuring-related costs primarily associated with the December 2011 Plan discussed on page 28.
58492_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	In 2012, earnings benefited from special tax items, which included the elimination of a valuation allowance on Canadian deferred tax assets.
58492_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Moderate inflation resulted in LIFO expense of $14 million in 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	In 2012, lower commodity costs led to a LIFO benefit of $15 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.
58492_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Net interest expense in 2012 was $5 million higher than in 2011, primarily due to the issuance in August 2012 of $300 million of long-term notes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The 2012 effective income tax rate of 18.5% on continuing operations was lower than the 24.2% incurred in 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	The 2012 tax rate benefited from the fourth quarter release of a $38 million valuation allowance on certain Canadian deferred tax assets (primarily tax loss carryforwards).
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	As a result of an increase in operating earnings in Canada, the amalgamation of two Canadian subsidiaries, and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in Canadian tax law, we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	The 2012 tax rate also benefited from the second quarter recording of a $6 million deferred tax asset for the tax basis of a subsidiary which is likely to be realized in 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	These benefits were partially offset by the fourth quarter accrual of $11 million of withholding taxes on earnings in China, which was required since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all these earnings within China.
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S5	We also experienced other, less significant, discrete tax items (both favorable and unfavorable) that substantially offset for the year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S6	Excluding the net impact of all these items, our 2012 effective tax rate would have been approximately 30%.
58492_13_ITEM7_P42_S7	We expect an ongoing cash flow benefit of $3 million to $4 million per year for the next 10 to 15 years as the Canadian tax loss carryforwards are utilized.
58492_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The 2011 tax rate benefited from changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions, one-time tax planning strategies, and the settlement of our 2004 through 2008 IRS examination.
58492_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	As a result of the tax planning strategies and tax audit, we recognized tax benefits of $5 million in 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which retroactively extended certain corporate tax provisions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Although several of these provisions will benefit our 2013 tax rate, we do not expect a material impact as a result of this legislation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	In the following section we discuss 2012 sales and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for each of our segments.
58492_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 80.
58492_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 4% in 2012, entirely from higher unit volumes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Demand improved in several of our residential markets during the year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 4%, in large part from growth of Comfort Core , which is our pocketed coil product offering.
58492_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	Strong market reception of hybrid mattresses is helping to drive growth in this category.
58492_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	We again had significant growth in adjustable beds, with unit volumes up 27% in 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	Sales also grew in geo components, carpet underlay, seating components, and sofa sleepers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	These improvements were partially offset by a 4% decrease in furniture hardware unit volumes and declines in our International Spring business.
58492_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012, primarily due to higher sales and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $7 million).
58492_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Sales in Commercial Fixturing Components decreased 5% in 2012, due to the divestiture of our U.K.-based point-of-purchase display operation in January 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Apart from the divestiture, sales in the segment were flat with 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P49_S2	Volumes in the Store Fixtures business were roughly flat for the year, with significantly lower spending by certain retailers offset by large programs (in the third quarter) associated with a major customer's re-branding initiative.
58492_13_ITEM7_P49_S3	Sales in our Office Furniture Components business were also essentially unchanged, which we believe was consistent with 2012 demand trends in the office seating market.
58492_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012, primarily benefiting from prior cost improvement initiatives and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $3 million).
58492_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Sales in the segment increased 3% in 2012, with revenue from acquisitions partially offset by lower trade sales from our steel mill.
58492_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2012 was largely offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	The rod mill continues to operate at full capacity.
58492_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	Despite the negative sales comparisons they create, lower trade sales of rod are generally neutral to earnings if production levels are stable and we're consuming the rod in our own wire mills.
58492_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus 2011, primarily due to the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $22 million), cost improvements, and earnings from acquisitions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	EBIT margins also increased during the year as a result of the change in sales from trade to intra-segment at our steel rod mill.
58492_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	This sales shift is beneficial to margins since it decreases our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels.
58492_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Segment sales and EBIT benefited from the acquisition (in January 2012) of Western Pneumatic Tube.
58492_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	That business, which resides in the Industrial Materials segment, exceeded our initial first year forecast, and as expected, generated EBIT margins greater than the company average.
58492_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 3% in 2012, with growth in Automotive partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates.
58492_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	Sales also increased slightly in Commercial Vehicle Products, but Machinery volumes were down versus the prior year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth during 2012 in North America and Asia, but sales declined in Europe from currency impacts and ongoing economic weakness.
58492_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012 primarily from higher sales and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $5 million).
58492_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, was not material in either year (2011 or 2012).
58492_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Sales growth in 2011 was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The main revenue catalyst was raw material-related price inflation, but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade) also contributed to the year-over-year increase.
58492_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Across the remainder of the company as a whole, unit volume was up slightly.
58492_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	Full-year earnings decreased, from $177 million in 2010 to $153 million in 2011 primarily from higher restructuring-related costs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2011, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Sales grew 8% in 2011, largely from inflation and currency rate changes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	Unit volumes grew 3% primarily due to a shift in the mix of sales at our steel mill (from intra-segment to trade).
58492_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	Across the bulk of our businesses, in aggregate, market demand increased slightly.
58492_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	Demand improved in certain of our markets during 2011, with automotive and office furniture leading the way.
58492_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	In contrast, stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets.
58492_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness.
58492_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Earnings decreased in 2011, largely due to restructuring-related costs associated with the decision (in the fourth quarter) to close certain manufacturing facilities.
58492_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	Other factors, including slightly higher unit volume, a lower effective tax rate, and higher selling, administrative, and other costs essentially offset during the year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e. outside the segments) to convert about 60% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	In both 2011 and 2010, moderate inflation led to full-year LIFO expense ($14 million in 2011 and $15 million in 2010).
58492_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.
58492_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net interest expense in 2011 was roughly flat with 2010.
58492_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The 2011 consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate of 24.2% was lower than the 28.1% incurred in 2010.
58492_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Several factors contributed to the reduction, including changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions, one-time benefits from tax planning strategies, and tentative agreement reached with the IRS regarding the examination of our 2004 through 2008 tax years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	As a result of the tax planning strategies and audit, we recognized tax benefits of $5 million in 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	This was comparable to a tax benefit realized in 2010 related to the IRS examination in that year of certain tax credit claims, which was substantially offset by incremental taxes from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings in that year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P67_S4	We also experienced other less significant, discrete tax items (both favorable and unfavorable) that substantially offset for the year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	In the following section we discuss 2011 sales and EBIT for each of our segments.
58492_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 80.
58492_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased in 2011, primarily from inflation and currency, which generated little profit.
58492_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Unit volume in the segment was flat.
58492_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	Demand in most of our residential markets continued to be soft as consumers postponed spending on larger-ticket items such as bedding and furniture.
58492_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Full-year 2011 unit volumes were essentially flat in our U.S. Spring business but declined in International Spring and Furniture Hardware (from pronounced market weakness mid-year).
58492_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	The only business in the segment that posted meaningful unit growth in 2011 was our Adjustable Bed business, where unit volumes grew 44% for the full year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, primarily due to higher restructuring-related costs (of $9 million), less favorable sales mix, inflation, and other operating cost increases.
58492_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	We initiated restructuring activities in the last half of 2011 in an effort to improve ongoing profitability, and part of that activity occurred in Residential Furnishings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	We consolidated four operations in the segment, including two carpet underlay plants, a Canadian spring facility, and a fabric coating business.
58492_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Sales decreased in 2011, largely from lower demand in our Store Fixtures business, as some of the large, value-oriented retailers significantly curtailed both new store construction and remodeling activity during the year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	In contrast, market demand continued to improve in Office Furniture Components as that business posted strong growth in 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	EBIT and EBIT margins in the segment decreased versus 2010, primarily due to lower sales in the Store Fixtures business.
58492_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	Our efforts to improve ongoing profitability resulted in the decision late in 2011 to consolidate one of our six remaining store fixture locations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	2011 sales increased, reflecting steel-related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill, both of which generated little incremental profit.
58492_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Full-year unit volumes declined in both Wire Drawing and Steel Tubing, reflecting weak bedding, furniture, and store fixtures end markets.
58492_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased versus 2010, mainly from higher restructuring-related costs (of $23 million).
58492_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	EBIT margins also decreased during 2011 as a result of a change in sales from intra-segment to trade at our steel rod mill.
58492_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	This sales shift is dilutive to margins since it results in a higher level of reported sales without increasing the level of reported EBIT.
58492_13_ITEM7_P77_S3	Reported earnings are roughly comparable despite whether rod is sold to our wire mills (intra-segment) or to trade customers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	Restructuring activities in late 2011 involved the closure of two facilities in the segment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	We closed one of our six domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into two of the remaining plants.
58492_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	We also announced the closing of a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks into the domestic appliance industry.
58492_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased in 2011, primarily reflecting improved demand across the major businesses in the segment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	Changes in currency exchange rates also added to year-over-year sales growth.
58492_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	Automotive growth continued to benefit from the recovery in global industry production.
58492_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	EBIT increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales partially offset by higher restructuring-related costs (of $7 million), raw material cost inflation, and currency impacts.
58492_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, was not material in either year (2010 or 2011).
58492_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Our operations provide most of the cash we require.
58492_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	Debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2012, cash from operations increased significantly from higher earnings and improvements in working capital levels.
58492_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	For over 20 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments.
58492_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	We expect this once again to be the case in 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	We ended 2012 with net debt to net capital at 29%, slightly below the conservative end of our long-term targeted range of 30-40%, and consistent with year-end 2011 levels.
58492_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 43.
58492_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	In August 2012, we issued $300 million of 10-year notes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	With the proceeds, we reduced our use of commercial paper and ended the year with our entire $600 million commercial paper program and revolving credit agreement fully available.
58492_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Cash is readily available to fund growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).
58492_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand manufacturing capacity.
58492_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	As shown in the chart above, capital expenditures have been stable in recent years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P89_S2	In all of our businesses, we invest to maintain facilities and equipment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P89_S3	We also invest to support new product introductions and specific product categories that are rapidly growing.
58492_13_ITEM7_P89_S4	However, with excess productive capacity across our operations (from continued low demand levels), we have had relatively low spending on expansion projects.
58492_13_ITEM7_P89_S5	We expect capital expenditures of less than $100 million in 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P89_S6	The expected increase versus 2012 primarily relates to new programs that we have been awarded, and that should contribute to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2014.
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Our strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	We are seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	During 2008 through 2010, acquisitions were a lower priority as we primarily focused on improving margins and returns of our existing businesses.
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	As a result, no significant acquisitions were completed in 2010 or 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S4	In 2011, we again turned our focus to acquisitions and began actively soliciting opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline.
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S5	In January 2012, we purchased Western Pneumatic Tube for $188 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S6	This acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.
58492_13_ITEM7_P90_S7	Western established for us a strong competitive position in the higher return, higher growth aerospace market.
58492_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 104.
58492_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Dividends are the primary means by which we return cash to shareholders.
58492_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	During 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of individual tax rate increases.
58492_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	The chart above reflects that accelerated dividend payment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	In 2013, we expect to return to our typical dividend schedule (and pay the fourth quarter dividend in 2014), therefore the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 will be lower, at approximately $125 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	In 2012, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.29 per share and extended to 41 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound growth rate of 13%.
58492_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	Our targeted dividend payout is approximately 50-60% of net earnings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	Actual payout has been higher in recent years, but as earnings continue to grow, we expect to move into that target range.
58492_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Stock repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders.
58492_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	During the past three years, we repurchased a total of 18 million shares of our stock and issued 12 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans, reducing outstanding shares by 5%.
58492_13_ITEM7_P94_S2	Given the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube early in the year, our share repurchases in 2012 were below those of recent years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P94_S3	During 2012, we repurchased 2 million shares (at an average of $25.35) and issued 5 million shares (at an average of $18.30).
58492_13_ITEM7_P94_S4	Two-thirds of the issuances related to employee stock option exercises, which increased notably in 2012 with the significant share price appreciation during the year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Consistent with our stated priorities, we expect to use remaining operating cash (after funding capital expenditures, dividends, and acquisitions) to prudently buy back our stock, subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation, and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company.
58492_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.
58492_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	Cash from operations increased 37%, to $450 million during 2012, on stronger earnings and improvements in working capital levels (largely from reductions in accounts receivable).
58492_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	In 2011, cash from operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	We continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended the year with adjusted working capital at 13.2% of annualized sales 1 , notably better than our 15% target.
58492_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	The table below shows this calculation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement.
58492_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($853 million in 2012 and $854 million in 2011) multiplied by 4.
58492_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.
58492_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	The increase in adjusted working capital relates primarily to the accelerated payment of the fourth quarter 2012 dividend ($41 million).
58492_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	The following table presents dollar amounts related to key working capital components at the end of the past two years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Trade receivables decreased from year-end 2011 levels, primarily due to lower trade sales late in the year in certain businesses and improved credit terms with certain customers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	Inventory increased from year-end 2011, primarily due to: i) acquisitions; ii) decisions to take advantage of temporarily lower commodity costs near the end of 2012 in certain businesses, and iii) higher production in late 2012 for programs that ship in early 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	Accounts Payable also increased primarily due to the opportunistic purchases of raw materials and higher production in late 2012, both of which also impacted inventory levels.
58492_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	The next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).
58492_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables (quarterly net sales number of days in the quarter).
58492_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Changes in the quarterly Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) reflect normal seasonal fluctuations due to the timing of cash collection and other factors.
58492_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	The decrease in the fourth quarter DSO was driven by improved payment patterns with several large customers, and some customers taking advantage of cash discounts and other incentives for early payment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	In 2012, we incurred $4 million of customer bad debt expense as compared to $6 million in 2011, which is largely a reflection of a modest improvement in the financial stability of customers in the majority of our markets.
58492_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	We expect DSO in 2013 to follow our normal seasonal pattern.
58492_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	Our Days Inventory on Hand (DIO) increased compared to the prior year primarily due to decisions to take advantage of temporarily lower commodity costs near the end of 2012 in certain businesses and higher production in late 2012 for programs that ship in early 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	We do not expect that either of these situations will increase our exposure to obsolete and slow moving inventory.
58492_13_ITEM7_P109_S2	During both 2012 and 2011, we recognized expense of $10 million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories.
58492_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	We actively strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors, and over the last few years, have increased our Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) by more than ten days.
58492_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	We expect that we will be able to continue this favorable trend going forward.
58492_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	Working capital levels vary by segment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Commercial Fixturing Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the Store Fixtures group.
58492_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	This business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.
58492_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	___________________________________________ (1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps.
58492_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	(2) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2012 and 2011, calculated in two ways:
58492_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.
58492_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $220 million in 2012, in part from the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube.
58492_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	In August 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal of notes that mature in 2022 unless redeemed earlier.
58492_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	The notes bear interest at a rate of 3.4% per year, with interest payable semi-annually beginning on February 15, 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P122_S2	The net proceeds of the notes were used to pay down commercial paper, which in turn provided borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, the repayment of existing indebtedness, the funding of possible future acquisitions, and stock repurchases.
58492_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	As a part of the above issuance, we also unwound the $200 million forward starting interest swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of approximately $43 million, which will be amortized over the life of the notes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P123_S1	This results in a fully weighted effective interest rate of 5.0% associated with the notes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 13 lenders.
58492_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	This agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five-year term ending in 2016.
58492_13_ITEM7_P124_S2	The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to $250 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P124_S3	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_13_ITEM7_P124_S4	Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2012 was $200 million and $382 million, respectively.
58492_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $4 million and $27 million respectively.
58492_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	Commercial paper amounts increased in January 2012 from the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube.
58492_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	Subsequently, borrowing levels fluctuated due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements.
58492_13_ITEM7_P126_S2	As discussed on the prior page, we used the proceeds from the notes we issued in August to pay down commercial paper, and ended the year with the entire $600 million program available.
58492_13_ITEM7_P126_S3	At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $68 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.
58492_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	On April 1, 2013, we have $200 million of 4.7% notes that mature.
58492_13_ITEM7_P127_S1	With anticipated operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our expected ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have more than sufficient funds available to repay this maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.
58492_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of $359 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	A substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost.
58492_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	However, if we had to bring all the foreign cash back immediately, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to $42 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P129_S3	In 2011 we brought back $89 million of cash, and in 2012 we brought back $50 million, in each case at no added tax cost.
58492_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2012:
58492_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2012 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_13_ITEM7_P134_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_13_ITEM7_P134_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71.
58492_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	In the past three years, no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews.
58492_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	Fair market value for one of the 10 reporting units (Store Fixtures) exceeded book value by approximately 10%.
58492_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	The goodwill associated with this reporting unit is $111 million, and is dependent on capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	Retailer activity was roughly flat in 2012, and the Store Fixtures reporting unit met full-year expectations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	However, due to the project nature of this business, the predictability of future results is less certain than that of other reporting units.
58492_13_ITEM7_P141_S4	If we are not able to maintain current performance levels, future impairments could be possible.
58492_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	The remaining reporting units have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than 35%, and have goodwill of $880 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C on page 75.
58492_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	Impairments were $2 million in 2012, $35 million in 2011, and $2 million in 2010.
58492_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	The 2011 impairments were largely the result of lowered future business expectations at several underperforming locations that resulted in the decision to exit some unprofitable lines of business.
58492_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	Prior forecasts assumed a recovery in business levels (primarily housing related industries) that had not materialized by late 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e. not selling very quickly).
58492_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	At December 31, 2012, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $36 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories).
58492_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	If we have more than a one-year s supply of a product, we value that inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover).
58492_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving.
58492_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	Additions to inventory reserves in 2012 were $10 million, which were comparable to the previous year.
58492_13_ITEM7_P160_S1	We do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels.
58492_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay (since we are self-insured).
58492_13_ITEM7_P162_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $10 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P163_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P163_S2	At December 31, 2012, we had accrued $33 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	Internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P164_S1	We expect worker compensation costs to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future.
58492_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	The average annual amount of customer-related credit losses was $6 million (less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P169_S1	At December 31, 2012, our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled $20 million (about 5% of our accounts and customer-related notes receivable of $434 million).
58492_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_13_ITEM7_P170_S1	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	In 2012 and 2011, bad debt expense averaged $7 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	We have not experienced any significant individual customer bankruptcies in the past two years.
58492_13_ITEM7_P172_S1	We believe the financial health of our major customers has modestly improved, but some are highly leveraged, and this could cause circumstances to change in the future.
58492_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had $11 million of non-customer notes receivable, primarily related to divested businesses, and have recorded reserves of $1 million for these notes.
58492_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	Most of these notes are to be paid by highly leveraged entities, which could result in the need for additional reserves in the future.
58492_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid, which also impacts current year pension expense.
58492_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	Determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities).
58492_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	The discount rates used to calculate the pension liability for our most significant plans decreased approximately 50 basis points in 2012 due to lower corporate bond yields.
58492_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.5 million and increases the plans benefit obligation by $9.6 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	Other assumptions include rates of compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates, and retirement ages.
58492_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	These estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	The expected return on assets in 2012 decreased to 6.6%, compared to 6.7% in 2011 and 6.8% in 2010.
58492_13_ITEM7_P179_S1	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.5 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_13_ITEM7_P181_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM7_P181_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_13_ITEM7_P181_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	We adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	Potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P185_S1	In 2012, we accrued $11 million for taxes on earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested in China.
58492_13_ITEM7_P185_S2	If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed, we would incur additional taxes of approximately $42 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	Tax audits by various taxing authorities are expected to increase as governments continue to look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_13_ITEM7_P186_S1	Based upon past experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $39 million and $14 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
58492_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_13_ITEM7_P187_S2	Valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a 50% probability of being realized.
58492_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_13_ITEM7_P188_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	The recovery of net operating losses (NOL s) has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P189_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_13_ITEM7_P189_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	We assessed our ability to recover Canadian NOL's and other deferred tax assets, and determined that previously recorded valuation allowances were no longer necessary.
58492_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	Therefore, we recorded income of $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to this reversal.
58492_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred, we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss.
58492_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_13_ITEM7_P192_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.
58492_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	We have several environmental clean-up activities related to current and closed facilities that mostly involve soil and groundwater contamination.
58492_13_ITEM7_P193_S1	Based upon facts available at this time, we believe reserves are adequate, however cost estimates could change as we determine more about the severity and cost of remediation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described beginning on page 52.
58492_13_ITEM7_P194_S1	Over the past five years, the largest annual cost for litigation claims was $6 million (excluding legal fees).
58492_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the probability that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost.
58492_13_ITEM7_P195_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.
58492_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC284 ( 2010 Suit ).
58492_13_ITEM7_P196_S1	The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 ( 2009 Suit ).
58492_13_ITEM7_P196_S2	The 2009 Suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff's failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders.
58492_13_ITEM7_P196_S3	As before, the plaintiff did not make such demand.
58492_13_ITEM7_P196_S4	On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice.
58492_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM7_P197_S1	On November 28, 2012, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal, and remanded the case back to the trial court finding that plaintiff sufficiently pled demand on the Board and shareholders.
58492_13_ITEM7_P197_S2	We filed a request for transfer to the Missouri Supreme Court on December 12, 2012, which was denied by the Court of Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM7_P197_S3	On January 3, 2013, we filed a transfer petition to the Missouri Supreme Court.
58492_13_ITEM7_P197_S4	On February 26, 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court denied our request.
58492_13_ITEM7_P197_S5	The case will be sent back to Jasper County, Missouri for further proceedings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	The 2010 Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S1	The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S2	The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants' stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S3	The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from us.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S4	We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S5	We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the 2010 Suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the Court's ruling in the 2009 Suit, this failure to make demand should not be excused; the dismissal of the 2009 Suit precludes the 2010 Suit; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the 2010 Suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S6	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_13_ITEM7_P198_S7	We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P199_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_13_ITEM7_P199_S1	A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed, most without prejudice.
58492_13_ITEM7_P199_S2	Of the U.S. cases remaining, we have been named as a defendant in (a) three direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) and a consolidated amended class action complaint filed on February 28, 2011 on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products; (b) an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 (although the underlying lawsuits do not name us as a defendant); and an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011; (c) 36 individual direct purchaser cases, (i) one filed March 22, 2011, (ii) another amended August 24, 2011 to remove class allegations, (iii) one amended August 25, 2011 to name us as a defendant, (iv) three others filed October 31, 2011, (v) one filed November 4, 2011, (vi) three filed December 6, 19 and 30, 2011, respectively, (vii) one filed January 27, 2012, (viii) five filed March 19, 2012, (ix) one amended March 30, 2012 to name us as a defendant, (x) one filed April 27, 2012, (xi) two filed April 30, 2012, (xii) two filed May 11, 2012, (xiii) one filed May 17, 2012, (xiv) four filed May 25, 2012, (xv) one filed June 12, 2012, (xvi) four filed August 8, 2012, (xvii) one filed September 21, 2012, (xviii) one filed November 7, 2012 (which suit also makes indirect purchaser claims), and (xix) two filed January 9 and 15, 2013, respectively; and (d) a direct and indirect purchaser class action filed on November 29, 2012 asserting claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act.
58492_13_ITEM7_P199_S3	All of the pending U.S. federal cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_13_ITEM7_P199_S4	In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_13_ITEM7_P199_S5	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P200_S0	On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim.
58492_13_ITEM7_P200_S1	On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss.
58492_13_ITEM7_P201_S0	Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P201_S1	Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.
58492_13_ITEM7_P201_S2	in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 (amended November 2, 2011) and CV-11-17279 (issued December 30, 2011).
58492_13_ITEM7_P202_S0	In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 15 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100 million, punitive damages of $10 million, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the investigation and the action.
58492_13_ITEM7_P202_S1	We are not yet required to file our defenses in the Canadian actions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P202_S2	In addition, on July 10, 2012, plaintiff in a class action case (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products) styled Option Consommateurs and Karine Robillard v. Produits Vitafoam Canada Limit e, et.
58492_13_ITEM7_P202_S3	No. 500-6-524-104, filed an amended motion for authorization seeking to add us and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products as defendants in this case.
58492_13_ITEM7_P203_S0	On June 22, 2012, we were also made party to a lawsuit brought in the 16 th Judicial Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, Case Number 1216-CV15179 under the caption Dennis Baker, on Behalf of Himself and all Others Similarly Situated vs. Leggett Platt, Incorporated - Polyurethane Foam Class Action.
58492_13_ITEM7_P203_S1	The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and/or a class of indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products in the State of Missouri, alleged that we violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act based upon our alleged illegal price inflation of flexible polyurethane foam products.
58492_13_ITEM7_P203_S2	The plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages, punitive damages and the recovery of reasonable attorney fees.
58492_13_ITEM7_P203_S3	We filed a motion to dismiss this action, which was denied on November 5, 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P204_S0	We deny all of the allegations in all of the above actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_13_ITEM7_P205_S0	These contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_13_ITEM7_P205_S1	Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any, because, at this juncture of the proceedings, the damages sought by plaintiffs are unspecified, unsupported, and unexplained; discovery is incomplete (no depositions have been taken, class certification issues are not yet ripe, expert liability reports have not been exchanged); and because the litigation involves unsettled legal theories.
58492_13_ITEM7_P206_S0	Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_13_ITEM7_P206_S1	( L P Brazil ) in the amount of approximately $4 million, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S1	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S2	On December 17, 2012, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued an additional notice of violation in the amount of approximately $6.2 million under MPF Case No. 0811000.2011.00438 covering the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 on the same subject matter.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S3	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 17, 2013 denying the violation.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S4	It is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation for years 2011 and 2012.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S5	In addition, L P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012 from the Brazilian Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L P Brazil's use of certain tax credits in the years 2006 through 2010.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S6	Such credits are generated based upon the tariff classification and rate used by L P Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P207_S7	Combined with prior assessments, L P Brazil has received assessments totaling approximately $2.0 million on the same or similar denial of tax credit matters.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S0	L P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking approximately $3.3 million for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n .04-256.169/2009).
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S1	The State of Sao Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S2	On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S3	The State filed a special appeal and the Special Appeals court remanded the case back to the Court of Tax and Fees for further findings.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S4	On November 9, 2012, the Court of Tax and Fees again ruled in favor of L P Brazil and nullified the tax assessment.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S5	On November 28, 2012, the State filed another special appeal.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S6	The determination to accept the special appeal was made on December 26, 2012, and L P responded to this special appeal on January 24, 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S7	We were also informed on October 4, 2012 that the State of Sao Paulo issued an Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine dated May 29, 2012 under Procedure Number 4.003.484 against L P Brazil in the amount of approximately $2.3 million for the tax years 2009 through 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S8	Similar to the prior assessment, the State of Sao Paulo argues that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S9	On December 18, 2012, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil issued a tax assessment to L P Brazil relating to L P Brazil's classifications of innersprings for the collection and payment of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings in Minas Gerais from March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012 in the amount of approximately $.7 million, under PTA Case No. 01.000.182756-62.
58492_13_ITEM7_P208_S10	L P Brazil filed its response denying any violation on January 17, 2013.
58492_13_ITEM7_P209_S0	We deny all of the allegations in these actions.
58492_13_ITEM7_P209_S1	We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_13_ITEM7_P209_S2	However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_13_ITEM7_P209_S3	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P210_S0	Patent Infringement Claim On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 million based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs.
58492_13_ITEM7_P210_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_13_ITEM7_P210_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_13_ITEM7_P210_S3	On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent's validity and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S0	At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 million.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S1	The court denied plaintiff's attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S2	On April 9, 2012 we appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S3	Oral argument was held on February 6, 2013 before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C. On February 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 million verdict against us.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S4	We intend to request a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S5	If a rehearing is not granted, we have the right to request further review to the U.S. Supreme Court.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S6	If the case is finally affirmed and remanded to the trial court, the plaintiff might also request royalties for post-verdict use of the machines.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S7	If so, we intend to object to such request.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S8	We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S9	The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of one of the three patents.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S10	The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second patent, but subsequently reversed that decision.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S11	With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S12	All three of these proceedings are currently on appeal before the Board of Patent Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S13	Due to a change made to all of the machines, we do not believe that the machines currently use the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.
58492_13_ITEM7_P211_S14	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM7_P212_S0	We adopted new accounting guidance in 2012, as discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71, which did not have a material impact on our current financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM7_P212_S1	The Financial Accounting Standards Board has also issued accounting guidance effective for future periods, but we do not believe this new guidance will materially impact our future financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The table below provides information about the Company s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its $1,030 carrying value by $45.7 at December 31, 2012, and greater than its $730 carrying value by $29.2 at December 31, 2011.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The increase in the fair market value of the Company s debt is primarily due to the issuance of $300 of new notes in 2012, and the decrease in credit spreads as compared to the prior year end.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2012 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Company s interest costs for its medium-term notes.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	These rates exclude the amortization of interest rate swap.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	It is the Company s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair value hedges is provided in Note S on page 105 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long-term commitment, and does not hedge translation exposures.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes.
58492_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company s net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to translation exposure) in foreign subsidiaries at December 31 is as follows:
58492_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Consolidated Financial Statements, Financial Statement Schedule and supplementary financial information included in this Report are listed and included in Item 15, and are incorporated by reference into this item.
58492_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation as of December 31, 2012, was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
58492_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2012, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
58492_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
58492_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting can be found on page 64, and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting can be found on page 65 of this Form 10-K. Each is incorporated by reference into this Item 9A.
58492_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
58492_13_ITEM10_P0_S0	The subsections entitled Proposal 1 Election of Directors, Corporate Governance, Board and Committee Composition and Meetings, Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity, Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance and Director Independence in the Company s definitive Proxy Statement for the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 9, 2013, are incorporated by reference.
58492_13_ITEM10_P1_S0	Directors are normally elected annually at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified.

58492_13_ITEM10_P1_S2	Mr. Purnell will retire from the Board on the date of the Annual Shareholder Meeting.
58492_13_ITEM10_P2_S0	In order to be nominated for election as a director, a nominee must submit a contingent resignation to the Nominating Corporate Governance Committee (N CG Committee).
58492_13_ITEM10_P2_S1	The resignation will become effective only if (i) the director nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in the director election; and (ii) the Board accepts the resignation.
58492_13_ITEM10_P2_S2	If a nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in the director election, the N CG Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the director s resignation and whether any other action should be taken.
58492_13_ITEM10_P2_S3	If a director s resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company s next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.
58492_13_ITEM10_P2_S4	If the Board accepts the director s resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy.
58492_13_ITEM10_P3_S0	The Company s Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines set the director retirement age at 72; however, the Board Chair, CEO or President may request a waiver for any director.
58492_13_ITEM10_P3_S1	At the request of Leggett s CEO, the N CG Committee recommended, and the full Board granted, retirement age waivers for Directors Clark, Enloe and Fisher so they may stand for re-election at the 2013 annual meeting.
58492_13_ITEM10_P4_S0	Brief biographies of the Company s Board of Directors are provided below.
58492_13_ITEM10_P5_S0	Our employment agreements with Mr. Haffner and Mr. Glassman provide that they may terminate the agreement if not re-elected as a director.

58492_13_ITEM15_P4_S0	We did not file other long-term debt instruments because the total amount of securities authorized under any of these instruments does not exceed ten percent of the total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

58492_13_ITEM15_P5_S0	Management of Leggett Platt, Incorporated is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
58492_13_ITEM15_P5_S1	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_13_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
58492_13_ITEM15_P6_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett Platt assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2012 , based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
58492_13_ITEM15_P8_S1	Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2012 , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 65 of this Form 10-K.
58492_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Leggett Platt, Incorporated:
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
58492_13_ITEM15_P11_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
58492_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

58492_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	Prior to 2010, many subsidiaries outside of the United States were consolidated as of and for a fiscal year ended November 30.
58492_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	As of December 31, 2010, these subsidiaries converted to a calendar reporting year.
58492_13_ITEM15_P20_S2	The net impact of the change in fiscal years of these subsidiaries was immaterial, and is presented as an adjustment to January 1, 2010 retained earnings.
58492_13_ITEM15_P20_S3	Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States.
58492_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies.
58492_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Legal costs are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
58492_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs.
58492_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable.
58492_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	Legal fees are accrued when incurred.
58492_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a trade note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	Nontrade notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business.
58492_13_ITEM15_P26_S3	Notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	Interest income is not recognized for accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
58492_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_13_ITEM15_P30_S2	The cost for approximately 60% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_13_ITEM15_P30_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_13_ITEM15_P30_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	We have had no material changes in inventory writedowns or slow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves in any of the years presented.
58492_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:
58492_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	A business is classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_13_ITEM15_P36_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell.
58492_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, in a held for use business, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_13_ITEM15_P41_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	Property is tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Our reporting units are the 10 business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.
58492_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group.
58492_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the business groups.
58492_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price-to-earnings ratios.
58492_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, internal sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P50_S3	Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P51_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P53_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_13_ITEM15_P54_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers nor is it our practice to replace goods damaged or lost in transit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_13_ITEM15_P61_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_13_ITEM15_P61_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_13_ITEM15_P61_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_13_ITEM15_P63_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_13_ITEM15_P63_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_13_ITEM15_P63_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F.
58492_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.
58492_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of noncustomer receivables.
58492_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	Noncustomer receivables primarily consist of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business.
58492_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_13_ITEM15_P69_S0	institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_13_ITEM15_P69_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P70_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P71_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_13_ITEM15_P71_S1	Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.
58492_13_ITEM15_P71_S2	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon reasonable estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_13_ITEM15_P72_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P72_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P72_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P73_S0	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_13_ITEM15_P73_S1	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P73_S2	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_13_ITEM15_P73_S3	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.
58492_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_13_ITEM15_P81_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2012 presentation:
58492_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	In the Consolidated Balance Sheets "Accounts and other receivables, net" is now presented separately as "Trade receivables, net" and "Other receivables, net".
58492_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Activity related to the change in commercial paper and short-term debt previously included in the Additions to/Payments on debt line items within Financing Activities is now presented separately.
58492_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	The FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods.
58492_13_ITEM15_P84_S1	The new guidance did not have a material impact on our current financial statements, and we do not believe any of the new guidance will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	Businesses divested in prior years and subsequent activity directly related to these divestitures have been reported as discontinued operations as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	2012 - We received a cash litigation settlement in the second quarter of 2012 associated with our former Prime Foam Products unit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	This unit was sold in March 2007 and was previously part of the Residential Furnishings segment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	2010 - The Storage Products unit was sold in 2010 as part of a broad strategic change that occurred in 2007 and was previously part of the Commercial Fixturing Components Segment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	The table below includes activity related to these divestitures, as well as a small amount of subsequent activity directly related to divestitures completed prior to 2010:
58492_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	(1) Impairment charges were recorded to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, as discussed in Note C.
58492_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.
58492_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	Asset impairments associated with continuing operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Other expense (income), net.
58492_13_ITEM15_P92_S1	Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	In December 2011, management approved the 2011 Restructuring Plan which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming facilities and resulted in impairment charges of $31.2 ( $19.0 for intangibles and $12.2 for fixed assets) during 2011 s fourth quarter.
58492_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	In 2012, approximately $1.2 of fixed asset impairments were related to this plan.
58492_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	These impairment charges were largely the result of lowered expectations of future cash flows in certain operations, including those that produce fabricated wire components used in home appliances.
58492_13_ITEM15_P94_S3	We also incurred restructuring charges associated with this plan as discussed in Note D.
58492_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Storage Products unit was sold in 2010 as part of a broad strategic change that occurred in 2007.
58492_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	As presented in the table above, asset impairment charges were recorded as updated estimates of fair value less costs to sell for this business became more certain.
58492_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers.
58492_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year or as triggering events may occur.
58492_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year as discussed in Note A.
58492_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_13_ITEM15_P98_S2	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P98_S3	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price-to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years.
58492_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium.
58492_13_ITEM15_P99_S3	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_13_ITEM15_P99_S4	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_13_ITEM15_P99_S5	Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10 -year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	The goodwill impairment reviews performed in each year presented indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P102_S1	Due to the limited nature and scope of changes to operations expected as a result of the 2011 Restructuring Plan, we concluded that a formal goodwill impairment review at December 31, 2011 was not necessary.
58492_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	Reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in the June 2012 review are presented in the table below.
58492_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	The 10-25% category below includes information for one reporting unit (Store Fixtures).
58492_13_ITEM15_P104_S1	The fair value of this unit exceeded its book value by 10% at the June 30, 2012 impairment review date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P104_S2	If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.
58492_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P105_S2	Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended December 31 were comprised of:
58492_13_ITEM15_P106_S0	In December 2011, we adopted the 2011 Restructuring Plan which included the closure of four underperforming manufacturing facilities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P107_S0	The following table contains information, by segment, regarding the amount of each major type of restructuring-related cost incurred in connection with the exit activities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P108_S0	______________________________ The portion of the total restructuring charges in the above table that represents cash charges is $3.7 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P109_S0	(1) Restructuring charges are reported on the Statements of Operations in Other expense (income), net.
58492_13_ITEM15_P110_S0	The accrued liability associated with the 2011 Restructuring Plan consisted of the following:
58492_13_ITEM15_P111_S0	We also incurred impairment costs associated with this plan as discussed in Note C.
58492_13_ITEM15_P111_S1	These exit activities were substantially complete by the end of 2012 and no additional significant costs related to the plan are expected.
58492_13_ITEM15_P112_S0	Apart from the 2011 Restructuring Plan, we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives over the last three years to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_13_ITEM15_P112_S1	None of these actions have individually resulted in a material charge to earnings.
58492_13_ITEM15_P112_S2	Total costs associated with these other initiatives have had the following impact on our financial statements:
58492_13_ITEM15_P113_S0	Restructuring and restructuring-related charges (income) associated with continuing operations by segment for the other initiatives were as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P114_S0	The accrued liability associated with Other Initiatives consisted of the following:
58492_13_ITEM15_P115_S0	The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P116_S0	The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset class and intangible assets acquired during the period presented included in "Other intangibles" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P117_S0	Estimated amortization expense for items included in our December 31, 2012 balance sheet in each of the next five years is as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P118_S0	We have four operating segments that are generally focused on broad end-user markets for our diversified products:
58492_13_ITEM15_P119_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_13_ITEM15_P119_S1	Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating decision maker.
58492_13_ITEM15_P119_S2	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_13_ITEM15_P120_S0	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_13_ITEM15_P121_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory.
58492_13_ITEM15_P121_S1	Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P122_S0	We evaluate performance based on earnings from operations before interest and income taxes (EBIT).
58492_13_ITEM15_P123_S0	Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices.
58492_13_ITEM15_P124_S0	Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P124_S1	Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales.
58492_13_ITEM15_P124_S2	These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P125_S0	A summary of segment results for the periods presented are shown in the following tables.
58492_13_ITEM15_P126_S0	Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance.
58492_13_ITEM15_P126_S1	These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P126_S2	Segment assets for all years are reflected at their estimated average for the year.
58492_13_ITEM15_P127_S0	Acquired companies long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P128_S0	______________________________ * Primarily goodwill, other intangibles, cash and deferred tax assets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P129_S0	Revenues from external customers, by product line, are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P130_S0	Our principal operations outside of the United States are presented in the following geographic information, based on the area of manufacture.
58492_13_ITEM15_P131_S0	Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:

58492_13_ITEM15_P138_S0	Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P139_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 of commercial paper through a program backed by our five -year $600 revolving credit agreement dated August 19, 2011 with a syndicate of 13 lenders.
58492_13_ITEM15_P139_S1	Based on the information currently available to us, we believe the participating banks continue to have the ability to meet their obligations under the agreement.
58492_13_ITEM15_P139_S2	The Company s ability to borrow under the 2011 Agreement is reduced by the amount of outstanding letters of credit issued pursuant to the 2011 Agreement.
58492_13_ITEM15_P139_S3	The amount of letters of credit is limited to $250 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P139_S4	The Company currently has no outstanding letters of credit under the 2011 Agreement.
58492_13_ITEM15_P140_S0	Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_13_ITEM15_P141_S0	disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 20% of total consolidated assets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P141_S1	We have remained well within compliance with all such covenants.
58492_13_ITEM15_P142_S0	We may elect one of four types of borrowing under the 2011 Agreement, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance.
58492_13_ITEM15_P142_S1	various published rates plus a pre-defined spread.
58492_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	The Company is required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the 2011 Agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P143_S1	Any outstanding principal under the 2011 Agreement will be due upon the maturity date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P143_S2	The Company may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under the 2011 Agreement, in whole or in part, upon three business days notice.
58492_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	We lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P144_S1	Lease terms, including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs, vary by lease.
58492_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	Total rental expense for the periods presented was as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	Future minimum rental commitments for all long-term non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	The above lease obligations expire at various dates through 2019.
58492_13_ITEM15_P147_S1	Aggregate rental commitments above include renewal amounts where it is our intention to renew the lease.
58492_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.
58492_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.
58492_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	Shares are issued from treasury for the majority of our stock plans activity.
58492_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan.
58492_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	On May 10, 2012 the Flexible Stock Plan changed the way awards granted under the Plan are charged against the number of available shares.
58492_13_ITEM15_P152_S1	Under the 2012 Plan modification, each option counts as one share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as three shares against the Plan.
58492_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	At December 31, 2012, the following common shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:
58492_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on the results of operations for each of the years ended December 31:
58492_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a windfall tax benefit is created.
58492_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital.
58492_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax shortfall is created.
58492_13_ITEM15_P156_S1	To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls, the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital.
58492_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	We have granted stock options in the following areas:
58492_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	We have historically granted stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_13_ITEM15_P158_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months , 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P158_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P159_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are amortized by the straight-line method over the options total vesting period, except for employees who terminate due to retirement.
58492_13_ITEM15_P160_S0	A retirement termination occurs if the employee is age 65 , or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination.
58492_13_ITEM15_P160_S1	For retirement terminations, options continue to vest and remain exercisable for three years, six months after termination of employment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P160_S2	Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.
58492_13_ITEM15_P161_S0	In connection with the January 2010 grant, officers received stock option awards.
58492_13_ITEM15_P161_S1	We gave other participants the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options.
58492_13_ITEM15_P161_S2	The value of the cash alternative (paid in the first quarter) was equal to approximately one-half of the Black Scholes value of the option grant the employee would have otherwise received.
58492_13_ITEM15_P162_S0	In connection with the January 2011 and 2012 grants, we offered two different option choice programs.
58492_13_ITEM15_P162_S1	One group of employees was offered the same option/cash choice as in 2010, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone.
58492_13_ITEM15_P162_S2	Another group of employees, generally higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of four options foregone for every one RSU offered.
58492_13_ITEM15_P162_S3	The stock units vest in one-third increments at 12 months , 24 months and 36 months after the date of grant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P163_S0	Starting in 2013, options will only be offered in conjunction with the Deferred Compensation Program discussed below.
58492_13_ITEM15_P163_S1	Options will be replaced with either cash awards or RSUs as offered in 2011 and 2012.
58492_13_ITEM15_P164_S0	Certain key management employees will participate in a new Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI) program.
58492_13_ITEM15_P164_S1	The PGI awards will be issued as growth performance stock units (GPSUs).
58492_13_ITEM15_P164_S2	The number of GPSUs that will ultimately vest will depend upon the Revenue Growth and EBITDA Margin of the Company or applicable profit center at the end of a two -year performance period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P165_S0	We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_13_ITEM15_P166_S0	Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_13_ITEM15_P166_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five , divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P166_S2	The option has a 10 -year term.
58492_13_ITEM15_P166_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P167_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_13_ITEM15_P168_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on the acquisition date and they vest immediately.
58492_13_ITEM15_P169_S0	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_13_ITEM15_P169_S1	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_13_ITEM15_P169_S2	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_13_ITEM15_P169_S3	Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.
58492_13_ITEM15_P169_S4	Beginning in 2010, stock units may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_13_ITEM15_P169_S5	Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.
58492_13_ITEM15_P170_S0	Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.
58492_13_ITEM15_P171_S0	Stock option information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P172_S0	Additional information related to stock option activity for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P173_S0	The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
58492_13_ITEM15_P174_S0	The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option.
58492_13_ITEM15_P175_S0	The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees.
58492_13_ITEM15_P176_S0	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility, measured daily for a time period equal to the option s expected life, ending on the day of grant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P176_S1	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P177_S0	We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_13_ITEM15_P177_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_13_ITEM15_P177_S2	In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.
58492_13_ITEM15_P178_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_13_ITEM15_P178_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P178_S2	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service.
58492_13_ITEM15_P179_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_13_ITEM15_P180_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_13_ITEM15_P180_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	Company contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S1	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S2	Beginning in 2010, units from the ESUP may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S3	The ESUP offered no diversification opportunity for contributions through March 31, 2011.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S4	Beginning April 1, 2011, participant contributions were credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we made premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S5	A participant s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S6	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units in these accounts.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S7	The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are a component of Other current assets and Sundry long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S8	Participant s diversified investment accounts are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company, and are presented as a component of Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet and will be settled in cash.
58492_13_ITEM15_P181_S9	Both the asset and liabilities associated with this program are presented in Note Q and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	Company matching contributions are in the form of stock units.
58492_13_ITEM15_P183_S0	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P183_S1	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.
58492_13_ITEM15_P184_S0	Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P185_S0	Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.
58492_13_ITEM15_P186_S0	We also grant Performance Stock Unit (PSU) awards in the first quarter of each year to selected officers and other key managers.
58492_13_ITEM15_P186_S1	These awards contain the following conditions:
58492_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	Beginning Stock Price] as compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies.
58492_13_ITEM15_P188_S0	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3 -year performance period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P189_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies and are based upon assumptions similar to those used for stock options.
58492_13_ITEM15_P189_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three -year vesting period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P190_S0	Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU s for the periods presented:
58492_13_ITEM15_P191_S0	Beginning with the 2010 award (that was settled in January 2013), thirty-five percent ( 35% ) of awards will be paid out in cash.
58492_13_ITEM15_P191_S1	We intend to pay out the remaining sixty-five percent ( 65% ) in shares of our common stock, although we reserve the right to pay up to one hundred percent ( 100% ) in cash.
58492_13_ITEM15_P191_S2	The 35% portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P192_S0	RSU awards are generally granted as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P193_S0	The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P194_S0	As discussed above, beginning in 2013, RSUs are awarded on a discretionary basis.
58492_13_ITEM15_P194_S1	In 2011 and 2012, selected employees could elect to receive RSUs in lieu of option awards.
58492_13_ITEM15_P195_S0	Stock unit information for the plans discussed above is presented in the table below.
58492_13_ITEM15_P196_S0	Prior to May 10, 2012, one stock unit was equivalent to one common share for authorized share usage.
58492_13_ITEM15_P197_S0	On May 10, 2012 the Flexible Stock Plan changed the way awards granted under the Plan are charged against the number of available shares.
58492_13_ITEM15_P197_S1	Under the 2012 Plan modification, each option counts as one share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as three shares against the Plan.
58492_13_ITEM15_P198_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the unrecognized cost of non-vested stock options and units was as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P199_S0	Under the Discount Stock Plan (DSP), a tax-qualified 423 stock purchase plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of Leggett common stock at 85% of the closing market price on the last business day of each month.
58492_13_ITEM15_P199_S1	Shares are purchased and issued on the last business day of each month and generally cannot be sold or transferred for one year.
58492_13_ITEM15_P200_S0	The accompanying balance sheets reflect a net liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
58492_13_ITEM15_P200_S1	Our U.S. plans (comprised primarily of three significant plans) represent 88% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.
58492_13_ITEM15_P200_S2	Participants in one of the significant domestic plans have stopped earning benefits; this plan is referred to as "frozen" in the following narrative.
58492_13_ITEM15_P201_S0	A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P202_S0	Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below:
58492_13_ITEM15_P203_S0	Included in the above plans is a subsidiary s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.
58492_13_ITEM15_P203_S1	This is a non-qualified plan, and the subsidiary owns insurance policies for the participants that are not included in the plan s assets with cash surrender values at December 31 as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P204_S0	Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions are reflected below:
58492_13_ITEM15_P205_S0	Of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2012, the portions expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in 2013 are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P206_S0	Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P207_S0	Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.
58492_13_ITEM15_P208_S0	We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points).
58492_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P209_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_13_ITEM15_P210_S0	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P211_S0	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings, as discussed below.
58492_13_ITEM15_P212_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_13_ITEM15_P213_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P214_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_13_ITEM15_P215_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_13_ITEM15_P216_S0	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_13_ITEM15_P217_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P217_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P218_S0	Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_13_ITEM15_P218_S1	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P218_S2	In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_13_ITEM15_P219_S0	Of our three significant domestic plans, the frozen plan (representing approximately 60% of the total benefit obligation) employs a Liability Driven Investment strategy and has a target allocation of 60% bonds and 40% equities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P219_S1	The remaining significant plans have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% bonds, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_13_ITEM15_P220_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to six different investments: four mutual funds and two separate accounts.
58492_13_ITEM15_P221_S0	The mutual funds, all passively managed low-cost index funds, include:
58492_13_ITEM15_P222_S0	Total Stock Market Index: Large, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_13_ITEM15_P223_S0	FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world.
58492_13_ITEM15_P224_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market.
58492_13_ITEM15_P225_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market.
58492_13_ITEM15_P226_S0	The separate accounts are invested as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P227_S0	Small cap U.S. equities: Portfolio of small capitalization U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 2000 Value Index.
58492_13_ITEM15_P228_S0	U.S. equities: Broad portfolio of U.S. stocks benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Index.
58492_13_ITEM15_P229_S0	We expect to contribute $1.5 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013.
58492_13_ITEM15_P230_S0	Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P231_S0	Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P232_S0	We have limited participation in two union-sponsored, defined benefit, multi-employer pension plans.
58492_13_ITEM15_P232_S1	We participated in one multi-employer plan in 2010 and 2011, and added one additional plan with the Western Pneumatic acquisition in 2012 (as discussed in Note R).
58492_13_ITEM15_P233_S0	These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provision of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_13_ITEM15_P233_S1	Aggregate contributions to these plans were less than $.5 for each of the years presented.
58492_13_ITEM15_P234_S0	In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if a plan has unfunded vested benefits.
58492_13_ITEM15_P234_S1	Factors that could impact the funded status of these plans include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P235_S0	We have a very small share of the liability among the participants of these plans.
58492_13_ITEM15_P235_S1	Based upon the information available from plan administrators, both of the multi-employer plans in which we participate are underfunded and estimate our aggregate share of potential withdrawal liability for both plans to be approximately $17.0 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P235_S2	We have not recorded any material withdrawal liabilities for the years presented.
58492_13_ITEM15_P236_S0	The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P237_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
58492_13_ITEM15_P238_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P239_S0	In 2012, the tax rate benefited from the elimination of a $36.9 valuation allowance ( $38.1 in the fourth quarter) on our Canadian net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P239_S1	As a result of an increase in operating earnings in Canada, the amalgamation of two Canadian subsidiaries, and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in Canadian tax law, we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years.
58492_13_ITEM15_P239_S2	We also recorded a $6.0 deferred tax asset associated with the excess outside tax basis of a subsidiary which is likely to be realized in the foreseeable future.
58492_13_ITEM15_P239_S3	These 2012 benefits were partially offset by the accrual of $11.2 of deferred withholding taxes in China on earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested in China.
58492_13_ITEM15_P240_S0	In 2012, 2011, and 2010 the tax rate benefited from income earned in various foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate.
58492_13_ITEM15_P240_S1	In 2011, the tax rate also benefited by a total of $5.2 from the release of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax audit settlements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P241_S0	In 2010 and 2011, we incurred $4.7 and $1.7 , respectively, of incremental tax on the 2010 repatriation of $112.6 of earnings from foreign subsidiaries.
58492_13_ITEM15_P242_S0	We recognized net excess tax benefits of approximately $5.5 , $6.1 , and $.1 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to stock plan activity, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital.
58492_13_ITEM15_P242_S1	These amounts include net windfall tax benefits as discussed in Note L.
58492_13_ITEM15_P243_S0	We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_13_ITEM15_P243_S1	In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_13_ITEM15_P243_S2	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_13_ITEM15_P243_S3	In addition, we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_13_ITEM15_P244_S0	The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012, is $35.5 , of which $23.4 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_13_ITEM15_P244_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2012, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P245_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_13_ITEM15_P246_S0	As of December 31, 2012, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2009 through 2012.
58492_13_ITEM15_P246_S1	In 2011, IRS examinations of the 2004 through 2008 tax returns were completed, and in 2012 refunds aggregating $15.6 were received for all years associated with the audit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P246_S2	In 2011, we adjusted our reserve for uncertain tax positions with respect to the largest issue in connection with the examination, related to worthless stock deductions, which had a favorable impact on our tax provision of $3.6 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P247_S0	Additionally, at December 31, 2012, four tax years were undergoing audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2005 through 2008.
58492_13_ITEM15_P247_S1	These examinations are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P247_S2	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years also remain open to examination, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P248_S0	It is reasonably possible that resolution of certain tax audits could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, as certain tax positions may be sustained on audit, or we may agree to certain adjustments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P248_S1	It is not expected that any change would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P249_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P249_S1	The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P250_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_13_ITEM15_P250_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_13_ITEM15_P251_S0	The large decrease in 2012 primarily stems from the reversal of a valuation allowance in Canada as discussed above.
58492_13_ITEM15_P252_S0	These loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, but no significant amounts expire in any one year.
58492_13_ITEM15_P253_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_13_ITEM15_P254_S0	The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.
58492_13_ITEM15_P254_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we have accrued $11.2 of deferred taxes associated with the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
58492_13_ITEM15_P255_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested.
58492_13_ITEM15_P255_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings which are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2012, are approximately $349.1 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P255_S2	If such earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental tax expense would be approximately $42.0 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.
58492_13_ITEM15_P256_S0	In 2010, we repatriated $112.6 of foreign earnings, resulting in net tax charges of $4.7 and $1.7 in 2010 and 2011, respectively.
58492_13_ITEM15_P256_S1	Although we have not changed our assertion with respect to amounts permanently reinvested outside the U.S., in 2012 we recorded $11.2 for withholding taxes in China, since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all of our Chinese earnings within China.
58492_13_ITEM15_P256_S2	These taxes would be due on dividends from certain of our China subsidiaries to their foreign parent, a subsidiary of the U.S. company.
58492_13_ITEM15_P256_S3	These earnings are still permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and are included in the undistributed earnings and incremental taxes discussed above.
58492_13_ITEM15_P257_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P258_S0	The components of other expense (income) from continuing operations were as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P259_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_13_ITEM15_P260_S0	We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P261_S0	The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets for potential impairment as discussed in Note C.
58492_13_ITEM15_P262_S0	The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.
58492_13_ITEM15_P263_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_13_ITEM15_P264_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P265_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_13_ITEM15_P265_S1	Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_13_ITEM15_P265_S2	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_13_ITEM15_P265_S3	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_13_ITEM15_P265_S4	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_13_ITEM15_P266_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_13_ITEM15_P267_S0	The following tables present assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
58492_13_ITEM15_P268_S0	* - Includes both current and long-term amounts combined.
58492_13_ITEM15_P269_S0	The fair value for fixed rate debt (Level 2) was greater than its $1,030.0 carrying value by $45.7 at December 31, 2012 and greater than its $730.0 carrying value by $29.2 at December 31, 2011.
58492_13_ITEM15_P269_S1	We value this debt using discounted cash flow and secondary market rates provided by Bloomberg.
58492_13_ITEM15_P270_S0	The following table contains the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P270_S1	All goodwill included in the table below is expected to provide an income tax benefit.
58492_13_ITEM15_P271_S0	The following table summarizes acquisitions for the periods presented.
58492_13_ITEM15_P272_S0	We are finalizing all of the information required to complete the purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_13_ITEM15_P272_S1	Preliminary information used in the fair value assessments in these acquisitions is primarily related to certain accruals and contingencies and the tax basis of assets acquired.
58492_13_ITEM15_P273_S0	On January 12, 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western) for a cash purchase price of $188 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P273_S1	Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the new Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.
58492_13_ITEM15_P273_S2	Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_13_ITEM15_P274_S0	Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included Western's competitive position, and its fit with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.
58492_13_ITEM15_P275_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_13_ITEM15_P275_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2012 and 2011 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_13_ITEM15_P275_S2	However, Western's activity is incremental to the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P276_S0	Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash, at a later date and, are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P276_S1	At December 31, 2012, there was no substantial remaining consideration payable.
58492_13_ITEM15_P277_S0	We also increased our ownership portion to 100% for the following businesses that were previously not wholly owned:
58492_13_ITEM15_P278_S0	In addition, in the third quarter of 2012, we invested $22.4 to acquire an interest in an unconsolidated entity related to a potential acquisition.
58492_13_ITEM15_P278_S1	This amount is included in "Sundry" long-term assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
58492_13_ITEM15_P278_S2	We have no contractual right or obligation to make any additional investment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P278_S3	At the time of the investment, we secured certain rights that allow us to liquidate our position without loss if we decide to no longer pursue this business as an acquisition.
58492_13_ITEM15_P279_S0	We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P279_S1	In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks.
58492_13_ITEM15_P279_S2	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P279_S3	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P280_S0	Derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:
58492_13_ITEM15_P281_S0	The commodity cash flow hedges primarily manage natural gas commodity price risk.
58492_13_ITEM15_P282_S0	Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges On August 12, 2012, we issued $300 of 10 -year notes with a coupon rate of 3.40% .
58492_13_ITEM15_P282_S1	As a part of this transaction, we settled our $200 forward starting interest rate swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of $42.7 , which will be amortized over the life of the notes.
58492_13_ITEM15_P283_S0	The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_13_ITEM15_P283_S1	The currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various foreign currencies.
58492_13_ITEM15_P284_S0	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted.
58492_13_ITEM15_P285_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_13_ITEM15_P286_S0	Our fair value hedges typically manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries inter-company assets and liabilities.
58492_13_ITEM15_P287_S0	Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings.
58492_13_ITEM15_P287_S1	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_13_ITEM15_P288_S0	We have deemed ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness.
58492_13_ITEM15_P288_S1	If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of operations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P289_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had derivative transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P289_S1	Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded directly to income and expense in the period impacted, and offset the majority of gains and losses on the underlying hedged item.
58492_13_ITEM15_P289_S2	Our most significant transaction and hedge outstanding at December 31, 2011 was liquidated in the second quarter of 2012.
58492_13_ITEM15_P290_S0	We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments.
58492_13_ITEM15_P290_S1	The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.
58492_13_ITEM15_P291_S0	The following table sets forth the pre-tax (gains) losses from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented.
58492_13_ITEM15_P292_S0	This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.
58492_13_ITEM15_P293_S0	We are a defendant in various proceedings involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
58492_13_ITEM15_P293_S1	When it is probable, in management's judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_13_ITEM15_P293_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings, and the total liabilities recorded are not material to our financial position.
58492_13_ITEM15_P294_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC284 ( 2010 Suit ).
58492_13_ITEM15_P294_S1	The 2010 Suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff, in the same court, on February 5, 2009 ( 2009 Suit ).
58492_13_ITEM15_P294_S2	The 2009 Suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff's failure to make demand on our Board and shareholders.
58492_13_ITEM15_P294_S3	As before, the plaintiff did not make such demand.
58492_13_ITEM15_P294_S4	On April 6, 2011, the 2010 Suit was dismissed without prejudice.
58492_13_ITEM15_P295_S0	On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM15_P295_S1	On November 28, 2012, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal, and remanded the case back to the trial court finding that plaintiff sufficiently pled demand on the Board and shareholders.
58492_13_ITEM15_P295_S2	We filed a request for transfer to the Missouri Supreme Court on December 12, 2012, which was denied by the Court of Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM15_P295_S3	On January 3, 2013, we filed a transfer petition to the Missouri Supreme Court.
58492_13_ITEM15_P295_S4	On February 26, 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court denied our request.
58492_13_ITEM15_P295_S5	The case will be sent back to Jasper County, Missouri for further proceedings.
58492_13_ITEM15_P296_S0	The 2010 Suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_13_ITEM15_P297_S0	The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_13_ITEM15_P297_S1	The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants' stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_13_ITEM15_P297_S2	The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from us.
58492_13_ITEM15_P297_S3	We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P297_S4	We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the 2010 Suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and, consistent with the Court's ruling in the 2009 Suit, this failure to make demand should not be excused; the dismissal of the 2009 Suit precludes the 2010 Suit; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the 2010 Suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_13_ITEM15_P297_S5	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_13_ITEM15_P297_S6	We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P298_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_13_ITEM15_P298_S1	A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed, most without prejudice.

58492_13_ITEM15_P298_S4	In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_13_ITEM15_P298_S5	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P299_S0	On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim.
58492_13_ITEM15_P299_S1	On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss.
58492_13_ITEM15_P300_S0	Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.

58492_13_ITEM15_P301_S0	In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 15 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100 , punitive damages of $10 , pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the investigation and the action.
58492_13_ITEM15_P302_S0	are not yet required to file our defenses in the Canadian actions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P302_S1	In addition, on July 10, 2012, plaintiff in a class action case (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products) styled Option Consommateurs and Karine Robillard v. Produits Vitafoam Canada Limit e, et.
58492_13_ITEM15_P302_S2	No. 500-6-524-104, filed an amended motion for authorization seeking to add us and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products as defendants in this case.
58492_13_ITEM15_P303_S0	On June 22, 2012, we were also made party to a lawsuit brought in the 16 th Judicial Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, Case Number 1216-CV15179 under the caption Dennis Baker, on Behalf of Himself and all Others Similarly Situated vs. Leggett Platt, Incorporated - Polyurethane Foam Class Action.
58492_13_ITEM15_P303_S1	The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and/or a class of indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products in the State of Missouri, alleged that we violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act based upon our alleged illegal price inflation of flexible polyurethane foam products.
58492_13_ITEM15_P303_S2	The plaintiffs seek unspecified actual damages, punitive damages and the recovery of reasonable attorney fees.
58492_13_ITEM15_P303_S3	We filed a motion to dismiss this action, which was denied on November 5, 2012.
58492_13_ITEM15_P303_S4	We deny all of the allegations in all of the above actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_13_ITEM15_P304_S0	These contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_13_ITEM15_P304_S1	Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any, because, at this juncture of the proceedings, the damages sought by plaintiffs are unspecified, unsupported, and unexplained; discovery is incomplete (no depositions have been taken, class certification issues are not yet ripe, expert liability reports have not been exchanged); and because the litigation involves unsettled legal theories.
58492_13_ITEM15_P305_S0	Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_13_ITEM15_P305_S1	( L P Brazil ) in the amount of approximately $4 , under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S1	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S2	On December 17, 2012, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued an additional notice of violation in the amount of approximately $6.2 under MPF Case No. 0811000.2011.00438 covering the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 on the same subject matter.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S3	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 17, 2013 denying the violation.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S4	It is possible that we may receive an additional notice of violation for years 2011 and 2012.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S5	In addition, L P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012 from the Brazilian Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L P Brazil's use of certain tax credits in the years 2006 through 2010.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S6	Such credits are generated based upon the tariff classification and rate used by L P Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings.
58492_13_ITEM15_P306_S7	Combined with prior assessments, L P Brazil has received assessments totaling approximately $2.0 on the same or similar denial of tax credit matters.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S0	L P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking approximately $3.3 for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n .04-256.169/2009).
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S1	The State of Sao Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S2	On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S3	The State filed a special appeal and the Special Appeals court remanded the case back to the Court of Tax and Fees for further findings.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S4	On November 9, 2012, the Court of Tax and Fees again ruled in favor of L P Brazil and nullified the tax assessment.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S5	On November 28, 2012, the State filed another special appeal.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S6	The determination to accept the special appeal was made on December 26, 2012, and L P responded to this special appeal on January 24, 2013.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S7	We were also informed on October 4, 2012 that the State of Sao Paulo issued an Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine dated May 29, 2012 under Procedure Number 4.003.484 against L P Brazil in the amount of approximately $2.3 for the tax years 2009 through 2011.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S8	Similar to the prior assessment, the State of Sao Paulo argues that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S9	On December 18, 2012, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil issued a tax assessment to L P Brazil relating to L P Brazil's classifications of innersprings for the collection and payment of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings in Minas Gerais from March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012 in the amount of approximately $.7 , under PTA Case No. 01.000.182756-62.
58492_13_ITEM15_P307_S10	L P Brazil filed its response denying any violation on January 17, 2013.
58492_13_ITEM15_P308_S0	We deny all of the allegations in these actions.
58492_13_ITEM15_P308_S1	We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_13_ITEM15_P308_S2	However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_13_ITEM15_P308_S3	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P309_S0	Patent Infringement Claim On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs.
58492_13_ITEM15_P309_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_13_ITEM15_P309_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_13_ITEM15_P309_S3	On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent's validity and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S0	At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 .
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S1	The court denied plaintiff's attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S2	On April 9, 2012 we appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S3	Oral argument was held on February 6, 2013 before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C. On February 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 verdict against us.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S4	We intend to request a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S5	If a rehearing is not granted, we have the right to request further review to the U.S. Supreme Court.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S6	If the case is finally affirmed and remanded to the trial court, the plaintiff might also request royalties for post-verdict use of the machines.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S7	If so, we intend to object to such request.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S8	We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S9	The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of one of the three patents.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S10	The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second patent, but subsequently reversed that decision.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S11	With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S12	All three of these proceedings are currently on appeal before the Board of Patent Appeals.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S13	Due to a change made to all of the machines, we do not believe that the machines currently use the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.
58492_13_ITEM15_P310_S14	At this time, we do not believe it is probable that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_13_ITEM15_P311_S0	Net earnings for 2012 include a second quarter $6 tax benefit associated with the tax basis of a subsidiary, and a fourth quarter $27 net tax benefit primarily related to the release of valuation allowances on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by withholding taxes on earnings in China.

58492_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores, automobiles and commercial aircraft.
58492_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	As discussed below, our operations are organized into 20 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.
58492_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.
58492_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials and machinery, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves.
58492_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.
58492_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Residential Furnishings groups include:
58492_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our Store Fixtures group designs, produces, installs and manages our customers store fixtures projects.
58492_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our Office Furniture Components group designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of engineered components and products primarily for the office seating market.
58492_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Commercial Fixturing Components groups include:
58492_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Customers of the Commercial Fixturing Components segment include:
58492_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe that the quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire.
58492_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	We have four wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	Our Steel Tubing business unit also supplies a portion of our internal needs for welded steel tubing.
58492_14_ITEM1_P8_S4	In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.
58492_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	In 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube (Western).
58492_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and formed the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.
58492_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	In 2013, we expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	The first was a UK-based business that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio.
58492_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Industrial Materials groups include:
58492_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	We use about half of our wire output and roughly 15-20% of our steel tubing output to manufacture our own products.
58492_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	For example, we use our wire and steel tubing to make:
58492_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Industrial Materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers, including:
58492_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, produces and sells components for automotive seating, specialized machinery and equipment, and service van interiors.
58492_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our established design capability and focus on product development have made us a leader in innovation.
58492_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	We also benefit from our broad geographic presence and our internal production of key raw materials and components.
58492_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Products manufactured or distributed by our Specialized Products groups include:
58492_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our primary customers for the Specialized Products segment include:
58492_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price).
58492_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2013 we generated TSR of 56% (16% per year on average), which placed us in the top one half of the S P 500.
58492_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth.
58492_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control.
58492_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	During the past three years, we generated $1.2 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
58492_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR.
58492_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $.30 per share.
58492_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Our dividend payout target is 50-60% of earnings; however we have been above that target in recent years.
58492_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Our dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) was 106%, 67% and 88% in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
58492_14_ITEM1_P22_S3	As our markets recover, we expect to move into our target payout range.
58492_14_ITEM1_P22_S4	In the meantime, we expect to generate enough cash to continue to pay and modestly grow the dividend.
58492_14_ITEM1_P22_S5	The Company has consistently (for over 20 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	We expect to use cash (after repayment of debt and funding capital expenditures, dividends, and growth opportunities) for share repurchases.
58492_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	During the past three years, we have repurchased 18 million shares of our stock (and issued 11 million shares through employee benefit plans), which reduced the net outstanding shares by approximately 5%.
58492_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	In 2013, we repurchased 6 million shares at an average per share price of $30.81 (and issued 3 million shares through employee benefit plans).
58492_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	In 2013, our shares outstanding was reduced by approximately 2% to 139.4 million at year-end.
58492_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest).
58492_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), operating cash flows, and return on assets.
58492_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets.
58492_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Long-term, we aim to achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually.
58492_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity.
58492_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions.
58492_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms: opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.
58492_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	Our long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	We seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return; (c) for stand-alone companies: generally, revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on companies: generally, revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
58492_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	In 2013, we expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	The first was a UK-based business acquired in May that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	The second was a French-based company acquired in July that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio.
58492_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	With these acquisitions, our Aerospace Products business unit, which is part of the Industrial Materials segment, has an annual revenue run rate in excess of $120 million.
58492_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	In 2012, we acquired for a cash purchase price of $188 million, Western Pneumatic Tube, which produces thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products for aerospace applications.
58492_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Western fabricates products from specialty materials, such as titanium, nickel, stainless steel, and other high strength metals for use in aircraft systems, including fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, life support, stability, and cooling systems.
58492_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Western operates two facilities, one in Kirkland, Washington, and another in Poway, California, and is part of the Aerospace Products business unit.
58492_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	We had no significant acquisitions in 2011.
58492_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	There were no significant divestitures in 2011, 2012 or 2013.
58492_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 78 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The percentages of our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our international operations are principally located in China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.
58492_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	The products we make in these countries primarily consist of:
58492_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Shafts for the appliance industry Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for components is growing.
58492_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.
58492_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 76% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	We have manufacturing facilities in countries around the world, as shown below.
58492_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	For further information concerning our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	The following table shows our approximate percentage of external sales by classes of similar products for the last three years:
58492_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel.
58492_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_14_ITEM1_P46_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
58492_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials.
58492_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.
58492_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	In 2013, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues.
58492_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 23% of these consolidated revenues.
58492_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing Components and Specialized Products segments.
58492_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
58492_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.
58492_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	We maintain research, development and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and at many of our other facilities.
58492_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	However, we estimate the cost of research and development was $20 million in 2011, $22 million in 2012 and $24 million in 2013.
58492_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 18,800 employees, of which roughly 13,200 were engaged in production.
58492_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	Of the 18,800, approximately 9,100 were international employees (5,200 in China).
58492_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	Roughly 14% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues.
58492_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2013.
58492_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2014.
58492_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.
58492_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 18,300 employees.
58492_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_14_ITEM1_P60_S4	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	These products represent a relatively small portion of the bedding market in units (approximately 10%-12%), but comprise a larger portion of the market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	In 2013, non-innerspring mattress sales declined and the proportion of the total bedding market that they represent also decreased.
58492_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	Most traditional bedding manufacturers (who are our customers) now offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel.
58492_14_ITEM1_P64_S4	These hybrid products, which allow our customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring, have been well received by consumers.
58492_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	For the past five years, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_14_ITEM1_P65_S1	The orders remain in effect while t he Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) conduct separate reviews to determine whether to extend the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_14_ITEM1_P65_S2	If it is determined that the revocation of the duties would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping of innersprings (determined by the DOC) and material injury to the U.S. innerspring industry (determined by the ITC), the duties will be extended.
58492_14_ITEM1_P65_S3	We believe that, without the extension, it is likely that dumping will recur and the U.S. innerspring industry will be materially injured.
58492_14_ITEM1_P65_S4	As a result, we are actively participating in the DOC and ITC reviews.
58492_14_ITEM1_P65_S5	We expect the DOC and ITC to issue their respective determinations in March 2014.
58492_14_ITEM1_P65_S6	If the duties are not extended, they will be retroactively revoked to February 2014 (for China) and December 2013 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	In addition, because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by shipping of goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses.
58492_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.
58492_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Residential Furnishings: typically does not exhibit any significant seasonality, except for a reduction in fourth quarter sales.
58492_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	Commercial Fixturing Components: generally has stronger third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the fourth quarter significantly lower.
58492_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	This aligns with the retail industry s normal construction cycle the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.
58492_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Industrial Materials: minimal variation in sales throughout the year.
58492_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Specialized Products: relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.
58492_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of Cash from Operations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 39.
58492_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from Government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any Government.
58492_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section.
58492_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
58492_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	In addition to these reports, the Company s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section.
58492_14_ITEM1_P77_S3	Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
58492_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses after the disposal transactions.
58492_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	For information on discontinued operations, see Note B on page 78 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves risk.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flow and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover and interest rates.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our components and products.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-third of our sales.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, a depressed housing market, or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Many consumers continue to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In late 2013, steel costs increased unexpectedly, and the timing of the increase (late in the year) resulted in a concentration of LIFO expense in the fourth quarter.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We are implementing price increases in early 2014 to recover these higher costs.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the later half of 2013, metal margins within our rod production operation were compressed due to downward pressure on steel rod prices from Chinese imports.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	raise more rapidly than the price of steel rod, the metal margins will be compressed.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In either instance, compressed metal margins could negatively impact our result of operations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	This trend could further negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-12%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If sales of foam or air core mattresses continue to grow appreciably, it could reduce our market share in the U.S. bedding market, and negatively impact our sales and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The revocation of duties on imports of innersprings from China, South Africa and Vietnam could reduce our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	For the past five years, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The orders remain in effect while t he Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) conduct separate reviews to determine whether to extend the duties through early 2019 (for China) and late 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If it is determined that the revocation of the duties would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping of innersprings (determined by the DOC) and material injury to the U.S. innerspring industry (determined by the ITC), the duties will be extended.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We believe that, without the extension, it is likely that dumping will recur and the U.S. innerspring industry will be materially injured.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	As a result, we are actively participating in the DOC and ITC reviews.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We expect the DOC and ITC to issue their respective determinations in March 2014.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	If the DOC and ITC revoke the duties it could reduce our share in the innersprings market, our sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	At December 31, 2013, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately $1.1 billion, or approximately 36% of our total assets.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled approximately $696 million, or approximately 22% of total assets.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The annual goodwill impairment review performed in June 2013 indicated no goodwill impairments, but fair market value for one of our ten reporting units (Store Fixtures) exceeded book value by approximately 18%.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures reporting unit was approximately $109 million at December 31, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The unit is dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Although 2012 performance was better than expected, 2013 fell short of expectations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The predictability of future results is less certain than that of our other reporting units due to the project nature of this business.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels in Store Fixtures, future impairments could be possible, which would negatively impact our earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We had been reviewing the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) group, which is part of the Specialized Products segment, as part of our ongoing strategic planning process with one possible strategic alternative being to divest all or part of the group.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	During this process, an unexpected decline in CVP group sales, earnings and operating cash flows occurred.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Consequently, we received a lower than previously expected indication of value relating to the potential disposition of the business.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	As a result, we conducted an interim valuation of the CVP group goodwill and other long-lived assets and, in December, concluded that an impairment charge was required primarily relating to goodwill of the CVP group.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $63 million in the fourth quarter.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	A further decline in the CVP group business could result in future impairments which would negatively impact our earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In 2013, 28% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of, and collections from, our customers, and manage the accounting for, and payment to, our vendors.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are exposed to legal contingencies related to various lawsuits and other claims that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our earnings and cash flows.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are a defendant in various legal proceedings, including antitrust lawsuits related to the alleged price fixing of prime foam and carpet underlay products, and other proceedings and claims.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	When it is probable, in management's judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_14_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If our assumptions or analysis regarding these contingencies is incorrect, we could incur damages which could have a material negative impact on our earnings and cash flows.
58492_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri.
58492_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	We currently have 131 manufacturing locations, of which 85 are located across the United States and 46 are located in 17 foreign countries.
58492_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Manufacturing locations that we own produced approximately 70% of our sales in 2013.
58492_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_14_ITEM2_P1_S2	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 92 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	In the opinion of management, the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_14_ITEM2_P2_S2	Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_14_ITEM2_P2_S3	With our current utilization levels, we should be able to increase unit sales by approximately $400 million (based on current sales mix) without the need for large capital investment.
58492_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The information in Note T beginning on page 113 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.
58492_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Environmental Matter Involving Potential Monetary Sanctions of $100,000 or More On March 27, 2013, Region 5 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a Notice of Violation("NOV") alleging that our subsidiary, Sterling Steel Company, violated the Clean Air Act and the Illinois State Implementation Plan currently in place.
58492_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	Sterling operates a steel rod mill in Sterling, Illinois.
58492_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	The NOV alleges that Sterling, since 2008, has exceeded the allowable annual particulate matter and manganese emission limits for its arc furnace.
58492_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	Sterling requested a conference with the EPA to discuss the alleged violations.
58492_14_ITEM3_P3_S2	The conference was held on May 20, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	On July 23, 2013, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation alleging that Sterling violated the opacity limitations of its air permit and Federal and state regulations.
58492_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	A conference to discuss the Finding of Violation occurred in the third quarter.
58492_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	Sterling intends to vigorously defend these matters in any enforcement action that may be pursued by the EPA.
58492_14_ITEM3_P5_S1	The EPA did not specify any amount of penalty or injunctive relief being sought in the NOV, Finding of Violation or in any conference.
58492_14_ITEM3_P5_S2	Any settlement or adverse finding could result in the payment by Sterling of fines, penalties, capital expenditures, or some combination thereof.
58492_14_ITEM3_P5_S3	Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM3_P6_S0	For the past five years, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_14_ITEM3_P6_S1	The orders remain in effect while t he U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) each conduct separate reviews (one for each country) to determine whether to extend the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_14_ITEM3_P7_S0	A-570-928; A-791-821; and A-552-803) and ITC reviews (Investigation Nos.
58492_14_ITEM3_P7_S1	731-TA-1140; 731-TA-1141; and 731-TA-1142) were self-initiated on November 1, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM3_P8_S0	We filed three Statements of Intent to Participate in the DOC reviews on December 2, 2013 (one for each country).
58492_14_ITEM3_P8_S1	We also filed a Statement of Willingness to Participate in the ITC reviews on December 2, 2013 (one collective filing).
58492_14_ITEM3_P9_S0	If it is determined that the revocation of the duties would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping of innersprings (determined by the DOC) and material injury to the U.S. innerspring industry (determined by the ITC), the duties will be extended.
58492_14_ITEM3_P9_S1	We have argued that, without the extension, it is likely that dumping will recur, the U.S. innerspring industry will be materially injured, and, as such, the duty orders should be extended.
58492_14_ITEM3_P9_S2	If the orders are revoked, the revocation would occur retroactively to February 19, 2014 (for China) and December 10, 2013 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_14_ITEM3_P9_S3	We expect the DOC and ITC to issue their respective determinations in March 2014.
58492_14_ITEM4_P0_S0	The following information is included in accordance with the provisions of Part III, Item 10 of Form 10-K and Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.

58492_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Price and volume data reflect composite transactions; price range reflects intra-day prices; data source is Bloomberg.
58492_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 14, 2014, we had 9,196 shareholders of record.
58492_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	We expect to continue to pay dividends on our common stock and we are targeting a dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) of 50-60%, though it has been and will likely be higher for the near term.
58492_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	Our dividend payout ratio was 106%, 67% and 88% in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
58492_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	See the discussion of the Company s targeted dividend payout under Pay Dividends in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 43.
58492_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	During 2012, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five of them, given its decision to accelerate the first quarter 2013 dividend payment into December 2012 in anticipation of individual tax rate increases.
58492_14_ITEM5_P5_S1	For 2013, the Company returned to its typical dividend practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in 2014.
58492_14_ITEM5_P5_S2	The five dividend payments in 2012 utilized approximately $200 million of cash while the three payments in 2013 utilized roughly $125 million of cash.
58492_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The table below is a listing of our purchases of the Company s common stock during each calendar month of the fourth quarter of 2013.
58492_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	(1) This number includes 4,983 shares which were not repurchased as part of a publicly announced plan or program, all of which were shares surrendered in transactions permitted under the Company s benefit plans.
58492_14_ITEM5_P7_S1	It does not include shares withheld for taxes for option exercises and stock unit conversions.
58492_14_ITEM5_P7_S2	(2) On August 4, 2004, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year beginning January 1, 2005.
58492_14_ITEM5_P7_S3	This standing authorization was first reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, filed August 5, 2004, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors.
58492_14_ITEM5_P7_S4	As such, effective January 1, 2014, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2014.
58492_14_ITEM5_P7_S5	No specific repurchase schedule has been established.
58492_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	______________________________ In the fourth quarter of 2013, we incurred $67 million of charges related to the Commercial Vehicle Products group ($63 million goodwill impairment charge and $4 million accelerated amortization of a customer-related intangible asset).
58492_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	In the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a $9 million bargain purchase gain related to an acquisition.
58492_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	Amounts for 2012 through 2009 were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain businesses from continuing to discontinued operations in 2013.
58492_14_ITEM6_P1_S1	For information about discontinued operations, see Note B on page 78 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	Net earnings for 2012 include a $27 million net tax benefit primarily related to the release of valuation allowances on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by deferred withholding taxes on earnings in China.
58492_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company incurred asset impairment charges and restructuring-related charges totaling $44 million in 2011.
58492_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	Of these charges, $25 million were associated with continuing operations and $19 million were related to discontinued operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Acquisitions contributed to modest sales growth in 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Same location sales (excluding acquisitions) were essentially flat, with slightly higher unit volume offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill.
58492_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Sales growth continued in Automotive and Carpet Underlay but these gains were largely offset by declines in Store Fixtures, Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP), and Adjustable Bed.
58492_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	As discussed throughout the year, we have been considering strategic alternatives for our CVP business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Late in 2013, it became apparent that current market values for certain CVP assets had fallen below recorded book values, and we recognized non-cash impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of the business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	Earnings in 2013 decreased (versus 2012) as result of these charges and the non-recurrence of a significant tax benefit from 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	We expanded our Aerospace Products business unit in 2013 with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	These new European-based operations added small diameter, high pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio and extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Operating cash for the full year was strong, helped in part by improvements in working capital levels.
58492_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 20 years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	2013 marked the 42nd consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period.
58492_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Only one other S P 500 company can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	We ended 2013 with net debt to net capital below the conservative end of our long-standing targeted range.
58492_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	In April we repaid $200 million of notes that matured and ended the year with nearly all of our $600 million commercial paper program and revolver facility available.
58492_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	We target TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long term.
58492_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	For the three years ended December 31, 2013, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average.
58492_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	That places us in the top half of the S P 500, but shy of our top one-third goal.
58492_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price].
58492_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	We seek to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S P 500) on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2013, we generated TSR of 16% per year on average, matching the return of the S P 500 index.
58492_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	That performance placed us in the top half of the S P 500 companies, but shy of our goal to be in the top third.
58492_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 6% of our sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized; they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding, a variety of other manufacturers, and many major retailers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-third of our sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	We continue to retain more production capacity than we currently utilize.
58492_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	Accordingly, unit sales can increase by approximately $400 million (based on current sales mix) without the need for large capital investment.
58492_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	We have meaningful operating leverage that should benefit earnings as market demand improves.
58492_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Until our spare capacity is fully utilized, each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume is expected to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod.
58492_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	This is a benefit that our competitors do not have.
58492_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.
58492_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	At various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	In late 2013, steel costs increased unexpectedly, and the timing of the increase (late in the year) resulted in a concentration of LIFO expense in the fourth quarter.
58492_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	We are implementing price increases in early 2014, and expect to recover these higher costs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile during certain periods in recent years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	In the back half of 2013, metal margins decreased due to downward pressure on steel rod prices from Chinese imports.
58492_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	We must continue to find ways to assist our customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Many of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.
58492_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	These products represent a relatively small portion of the bedding market in units (approximately 10%-12%), but comprise a larger portion of the market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices.
58492_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	In 2013, non-innerspring mattress sales declined and the proportion of the total bedding market that they represent also decreased.
58492_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	Most traditional bedding manufacturers (who are our customers) now offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel.
58492_14_ITEM7_P25_S4	These hybrid products, which allow our customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring, have been well received by consumers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	For the past five years, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The orders remain in effect while the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) conduct separate reviews to determine whether to extend the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	If it is determined that the revocation of the duties would likely lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping of innersprings (determined by the DOC) and material injury to the U.S. innerspring industry (determined by the ITC), the duties will be extended.
58492_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	We have argued that, without the extension, it is likely that dumping will recur, the U.S. innerspring industry will be materially injured, and as such, the duty orders should be extended.
58492_14_ITEM7_P26_S4	If the orders are revoked, the revocation would occur retroactively to February 19, 2014 (for China) and December 10, 2013 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_14_ITEM7_P26_S5	We expect the DOC and ITC to issue their respective determinations in March 2014.
58492_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	In addition, because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by shipping of goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	In December 2011, we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our overhead costs and improve ongoing profitability.
58492_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The activities primarily entailed the closure of four underperforming facilities.
58492_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	We incurred a $37 million pre-tax (largely non-cash) charge in 2011 primarily related to this plan, of which $18 million related to continuing operations and $19 million was associated with discontinued operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	These activities were substantially complete by the end of 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Sales grew modestly in 2013 as a result of acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Same location sales were essentially flat with slightly higher unit volume offset by lower trade sales at our steel rod mill (sales shifted from trade to intra-segment).
58492_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	Earnings decreased in 2013 (versus 2012) as a result of impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and the non-recurrence of a significant tax benefit from 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2013, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	Same location sales were essentially flat, with 1% unit volume growth offset by a 1% revenue decline from lower trade sales at our rod mill.
58492_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Sales grew primarily from market strength and new program awards in Automotive and raw material-related price increases in Carpet Underlay.
58492_14_ITEM7_P34_S2	These improvements were partially offset by declines in Store Fixtures, CVP, and Adjustable Bed.
58492_14_ITEM7_P34_S3	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2013 was offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, and the rod mill continued to operate at full capacity.
58492_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Earnings decreased as a result of non-cash impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and the non-recurrence of a significant tax benefit from 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Operationally, the earnings benefit from modest unit volume growth and acquisitions was essentially offset by an increase in steel costs late in the year that resulted in higher LIFO expense.
58492_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	We are implementing price increases in early 2014, and expect to recover the higher costs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	The other items detailed in the table above also collectively contributed to the change in earnings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 55% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	In 2012, lower commodity costs led to a LIFO benefit of $15 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	Steel inflation in late 2013 resulted in a significant change in our full-year LIFO estimates (interim expectations for a full-year LIFO benefit of $13 million changed instead to a full year expense of $2 million as steel costs increased late in the year) and a concentration of LIFO expense in the fourth quarter.
58492_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74.
58492_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Net interest expense in 2013 was flat with 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The 2013 worldwide effective income tax rate on our continuing operations was 22%, compared to 21% for 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	In both years the tax rate reflects necessary tax reserve reductions and other tax benefits that lowered the overall rate.
58492_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	The 2013 tax rate includes $17 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state tax audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	The impact of these items on the tax rate was magnified by our fourth quarter CVP impairment.
58492_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	In 2012, the tax rate benefited from the release of a $38 million valuation allowance on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by the accrual of $11 million of China withholding taxes.
58492_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	In the following section we discuss 2013 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for each of our segments.
58492_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	2012 amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain operations to discontinued operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 78.
58492_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 3% in 2013 from unit volume growth in certain product categories and raw material-related price increases in carpet underlay.
58492_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Volume grew primarily in European spring, seating components, sofa sleepers, and carpet underlay.
58492_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	These gains were partially offset by lower adjustable bed volume.
58492_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	Within our U.S. Spring business, we experienced unit volume growth in box springs and Comfort Core (which is our pocketed coil innerspring), however total domestic innerspring units decreased modestly.
58492_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	Furniture hardware unit volumes also decreased for the full year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2013, primarily due to higher sales, cost improvements, and favorable product mix in U.S. Spring.
58492_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	Sales in Commercial Fixturing Components decreased 6% in 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Volumes in the Store Fixtures business were down 8% for the year, reflecting continued weak capital spending by retailers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Sales in our Office Furniture Components business decreased 3%, which we believe was consistent with demand trends in the office seating market.
58492_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased in 2013, primarily from lower sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Sales in the segment decreased 3% in 2013, with revenue from acquisitions more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill and steel-related price deflation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the year was more than offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, and the rod mill continued to operate at full capacity.
58492_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	A change in the mix of rod sales from trade to intra-segment is generally positive to earnings since that change tends to also shift the production mix to higher-value high carbon rods.
58492_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins improved versus 2012, primarily due to the absence of acquisition-related costs at Western Pneumatic Tube and earnings from acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	These gains were partially offset by lower metal margins in steel rod in the second half of 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	We expanded our Aerospace Products business unit in 2013 with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	The first was a U.K.-based business acquired in May that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	The second was a French-based company acquired in July that added small diameter, high pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio.
58492_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Aerospace Products business unit, which now has an annual revenue run rate in excess of $120 million, continues to perform very well and earnings should further benefit as we fully integrate these recent acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2013, with growth in Automotive partially offset by a decline in Commercial Vehicle Products.
58492_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth from a combination of factors, including market strength in North America and Asia, participation in additional vehicle platforms, and expanded component content (via upgraded features).
58492_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	EBIT decreased $60 million in 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	We recognized impairment and other charges (of $67 million) related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and this was partially offset by the positive impact from higher sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have been considering strategic alternatives for our CVP group, including possible divestiture of the business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Late in 2013, performance of the business deteriorated.
58492_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result, it became apparent that current market values for certain CVP assets had fallen below recorded book values, and impairment charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets were recognized.
58492_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	This decline in current market values of the assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and profitability, reflecting reduced market demand for the racks, shelving, and cabinets used in telecom, cable, and delivery vans.
58492_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $7 million in both 2013 and 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	Amounts in both years were primarily attributable to tax benefits.
58492_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	In addition, 2012 included a $2 million gain from a litigation settlement associated with a previously divested business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Demand improved in many of our markets during 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Growth in unit volumes was partially offset by lower trade sales at our steel mill (sales shifted from trade to intra-segment) and changes in currency rates.
58492_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Earnings increased significantly, from $153 million in 2011 to $248 million in 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	This improvement reflects several factors, including lower restructuring-related costs, higher unit volumes, significant net tax benefits, cost improvements, and earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.
58492_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during 2012, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Improved demand in several of our markets led to higher sales in 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	Same location sales increased 1%, with 3% unit volume growth partially offset by a 2% revenue decline from lower trade sales at our steel mill and changes in currency rates.
58492_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	Unit volumes grew during the year in Automotive, U.S. Spring, Adjustable Bed, Geo Components, Carpet Underlay, and certain parts of our home furniture components business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2012 was largely offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Earnings increased significantly in 2012 due to several factors.
58492_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	Operationally, these included higher unit volumes, cost improvements, and earnings from the Western Pneumatic Tube acquisition.
58492_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	The other items detailed in the table above also collectively contributed to the earnings increase.
58492_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	In 2011, earnings were reduced by restructuring-related costs primarily associated with the December 2011 Plan discussed on page 30.
58492_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	In 2012, earnings benefited from various tax items, including the elimination of a valuation allowance on Canadian deferred tax assets.
58492_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Moderate inflation resulted in LIFO expense of $14 million in 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	In 2012, lower commodity costs led to a LIFO benefit of $15 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74.
58492_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net interest expense in 2012 was $5 million higher than in 2011, primarily due to the issuance in August 2012 of $300 million of long-term notes.
58492_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	The 2012 effective income tax rate of 21% on continuing operations was lower than the 26% incurred in 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The 2012 tax rate benefited from the release of a $38 million valuation allowance on certain Canadian deferred tax assets (primarily tax loss carryforwards).
58492_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	As a result of an increase in operating earnings in Canada, the amalgamation of two Canadian subsidiaries, and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in Canadian tax law, we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	This benefit was partially offset by an accrual of $11 million of withholding taxes on earnings in China, which was required since we no longer had specific plans to reinvest all these earnings within China.
58492_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	We also experienced other, less significant, discrete tax items (both favorable and unfavorable) that substantially offset for the year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	The 2011 tax rate benefited from changes in our mix of earnings among taxing jurisdictions, one-time tax planning strategies, and the settlement of our 2004 through 2008 IRS examination.
58492_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	As a result of the tax planning strategies and tax audit, we recognized tax benefits of $5 million in 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	In the following section we discuss 2012 sales and EBIT for each of our segments.
58492_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	A mounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain operations to discontinued operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 78.
58492_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P71_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 4% in 2012, from higher unit volumes and small acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Demand improved in several of our residential markets during the year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P72_S2	In our U.S. Spring business, innerspring unit volumes increased 4%, in large part from growth of Comfort Core , which is our pocketed coil innerspring.
58492_14_ITEM7_P72_S3	Strong market reception of hybrid mattresses helped to drive growth in this category.
58492_14_ITEM7_P72_S4	We had significant growth in adjustable beds, with unit volumes up 27% in 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P72_S5	Sales also grew in geo components, carpet underlay, seating components, and sofa sleepers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P72_S6	These improvements were partially offset by a 4% decrease in furniture hardware unit volumes and declines in our International Spring business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012, primarily due to higher sales and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $7 million).
58492_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Sales in Commercial Fixturing Components decreased 5% in 2012, due to the divestiture of our U.K.-based point-of-purchase display operation in January 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Apart from the divestiture, sales in the segment were flat with 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	Volumes in the Store Fixtures business were roughly flat in 2012, with significantly lower spending by certain retailers offset by large programs associated with a major customer's re-branding initiative.
58492_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	Sales in our Office Furniture Components business were also essentially unchanged in 2012, which we believe was consistent with demand trends in the office seating market.
58492_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012, primarily benefiting from prior cost improvement initiatives and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $3 million).
58492_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Sales in the segment increased 3% in 2012, with revenue from acquisitions partially offset by lower trade sales from our steel mill.
58492_14_ITEM7_P76_S1	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2012 was largely offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, so total rod production for the year was roughly flat with 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	The rod mill continued to operate at full capacity.
58492_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Despite the negative sales comparisons they create, lower trade sales of rod are generally neutral to earnings if production levels are stable and we consume the rod in our own wire mills.
58492_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased versus 2011 primarily due to cost improvements, earnings from acquisitions, and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $3 million).
58492_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	EBIT margins also increased during the year as a result of the change in sales from trade to intra-segment at our steel rod mill.
58492_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	This sales shift was beneficial to margins since it decreased our reported sales while preserving comparable EBIT levels.
58492_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2012, with growth in Automotive partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates.
58492_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	Sales also increased slightly in Commercial Vehicle Products, but Machinery volumes were down versus the prior year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth during 2012 in North America and Asia, but sales declined in Europe from currency impacts and ongoing economic weakness.
58492_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2012 primarily from higher sales and the absence of the December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $5 million).
58492_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $7 million in 2012 versus a loss of $17 million in 2011, primarily due to the absence of December 2011 restructuring-related costs (of $12 million, net of tax) and a $6 million tax benefit in 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Our operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	Cash from operations was once again strong in 2013, however declined modestly versus 2012 due to less improvement in working capital.
58492_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	For over 20 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments.
58492_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	We expect this once again to be the case in 2014.
58492_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	With fewer acquisitions completed in 2013, share repurchases increased.
58492_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	We bought back 6 million shares of our stock during the year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	We ended 2013 with net debt to net capital at 27%, well below the conservative end of our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%.
58492_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 45.
58492_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	In April 2013, we repaid $200 million of 4.7% notes that matured.
58492_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	We ended the year with $584 million of our $600 million commercial paper program available.
58492_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Cash from operations was $417 million during 2013, down from $450 million in 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	Cash from operations in 2012 benefited from significant year-end reductions in working capital levels (primarily accounts receivable).
58492_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	We continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended 2013 with adjusted working capital at 10.1% of annualized sales 1 , notably better than our 15% target.
58492_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	The table below shows this non-GAAP calculation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our performance related to operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement.
58492_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($897 million in 2013 and $850 million in 2012) multiplied by 4.
58492_14_ITEM7_P90_S1	We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.
58492_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following table presents dollar amounts related to key working capital components at the end of the past two years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Accelerated payments by some of our large customers late in 2012 resulted in much lower levels of trade receivables at the end of that year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	In 2013, trade receivables were also seasonally low at year-end but increased versus 2012 in part from acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Accounts Payable also increased primarily due to the timing of raw material purchases, extended payment terms with vendors, and acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	The next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).
58492_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables (quarterly net sales number of days in the quarter).
58492_14_ITEM7_P95_S1	The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_14_ITEM7_P95_S2	The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Changes in the quarterly Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) reflect normal seasonal fluctuations due to the timing of cash collection and other factors.
58492_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	Changes in the DSO reflected in the table above are consistent with our historical range, and are not indicative of changes in payment trends or credit worthiness of customers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	We experienced reductions in our DSO over the last two years driven by improved payment patterns of several large customers, certain customers taking advantage of cash discounts, and other programs with incentives for early payment offered in conjunction with third parties.
58492_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Payment trends by major customers were stable during 2013, resulting in full-year bad debt expense that was similar to 2012 levels.
58492_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	Our Days Inventory on Hand (DIO) typically fluctuates within a reasonably narrow range as a result of differences in the timing of sales, production levels, and inventory purchases.
58492_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	After inventory increased at the end of 2012 primarily due to decisions to take advantage of temporarily lower commodity costs, inventory has since returned to more normal levels.
58492_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	Expense associated with slow moving and obsolete inventories in 2013 was generally in line with that of 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	We actively strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors, and we have also implemented various programs with our vendors and third parties that allow flexible payment options.
58492_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	As a result of these activities, we have increased our Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) by more than ten days over the past several years, and we expect that we will be able to make further improvements going forward.
58492_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	Working capital levels vary by segment.
58492_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Commercial Fixturing Components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the Store Fixtures group.
58492_14_ITEM7_P100_S1	This business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products, longer manufacturing lead times (in certain cases), and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time.
58492_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	Cash is readily available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).
58492_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand manufacturing capacity.
58492_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	We also invest to support new product introductions and specific product categories that are rapidly growing.
58492_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	With current capacity utilization rates still relatively low, our need to invest in additional productive capacity is limited.
58492_14_ITEM7_P102_S3	In 2014, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $100 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P102_S4	As volumes improve, we expect capital expenditure levels to increase, but longer-term they should remain below total depreciation and amortization.
58492_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital.
58492_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	This emphasis heightens the focus on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.
58492_14_ITEM7_P104_S0	Our strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P104_S1	We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our Grow businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_14_ITEM7_P104_S2	In January 2012, we purchased Western Pneumatic Tube for $188 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P104_S3	This acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.
58492_14_ITEM7_P104_S4	Western established for us a strong competitive position in the higher return, higher growth aerospace market.
58492_14_ITEM7_P104_S5	In 2013, we acquired two smaller, complementary businesses in this aerospace tubing platform.
58492_14_ITEM7_P105_S0	Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109.
58492_14_ITEM7_P106_S0	Dividends are one of the primary means by which we return cash to shareholders.
58492_14_ITEM7_P106_S1	During 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of individual tax rate increases.
58492_14_ITEM7_P106_S2	The chart above reflects that accelerated dividend payment.
58492_14_ITEM7_P106_S3	In 2013, we returned to our prior practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in 2014.
58492_14_ITEM7_P106_S4	Therefore, the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 was lower, at approximately $125 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P106_S5	In 2014, we plan to return to our typical dividend payment schedule.
58492_14_ITEM7_P107_S0	Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_14_ITEM7_P107_S1	In 2013, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.30 per share and extended to 42 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound growth rate of 13%.
58492_14_ITEM7_P107_S2	Our targeted dividend payout ratio is approximately 50-60% of net earnings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P107_S3	Actual payout ratio has been higher in recent years, but as earnings grow, we expect to move into that target range.
58492_14_ITEM7_P108_S0	Stock repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders.
58492_14_ITEM7_P108_S1	During the past three years, we repurchased a total of 18 million shares of our stock and issued 11 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans, reducing outstanding shares by 5%.
58492_14_ITEM7_P108_S2	Given the $188 million cash outlay to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube early in 2012, our share repurchases in that year were much lower (as anticipated).
58492_14_ITEM7_P108_S3	In 2013, we repurchased 6 million shares (at an average of $30.81) and issued 3 million shares (at an average of $21.47).
58492_14_ITEM7_P108_S4	Issuances were largely related to employee stock option exercises.
58492_14_ITEM7_P109_S0	Consistent with our stated priorities, we expect to use remaining operating cash (after funding capital expenditures, dividends, and acquisitions) to prudently buy back our stock, subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation, and other potential opportunities to strategically grow the company.
58492_14_ITEM7_P109_S1	We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.
58492_14_ITEM7_P110_S0	This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P111_S0	___________________________________________ (1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_14_ITEM7_P111_S1	The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps.
58492_14_ITEM7_P112_S0	(2) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_14_ITEM7_P113_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_14_ITEM7_P114_S0	The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2013 and 2012, calculated in two ways:
58492_14_ITEM7_P115_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_14_ITEM7_P116_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_14_ITEM7_P117_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_14_ITEM7_P117_S1	We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.
58492_14_ITEM7_P118_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) decreased $186 million in 2013, primarily from the repayment of $200 million in notes discussed below.
58492_14_ITEM7_P119_S0	In August 2012, we issued $300 million aggregate principal of 10-year notes at a rate of 3.4% per year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P119_S1	As a part of this issuance, we also unwound the $200 million forward starting interest swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of approximately $43 million, which will be amortized over the life of the notes.
58492_14_ITEM7_P119_S2	This results in a fully weighted effective interest rate of 5.0% associated with these notes.
58492_14_ITEM7_P120_S0	On April 1, 2013, we repaid $200 million of 4.7% notes that matured.
58492_14_ITEM7_P120_S1	We funded the payoff with a combination of cash and commercial paper.
58492_14_ITEM7_P121_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 13 lenders.
58492_14_ITEM7_P121_S1	This agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five-year term ending in 2016.
58492_14_ITEM7_P121_S2	In 2013, we extended the term by one year to 2017.
58492_14_ITEM7_P122_S0	The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P122_S1	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_14_ITEM7_P122_S2	Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_14_ITEM7_P123_S0	The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2013 was $118 million and $198 million, respectively.
58492_14_ITEM7_P123_S1	During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $130 million and $162 million respectively.
58492_14_ITEM7_P123_S2	At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $76 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.
58492_14_ITEM7_P124_S0	In November 2014, we have $180 million of 4.65% notes that mature.
58492_14_ITEM7_P124_S1	With operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.
58492_14_ITEM7_P125_S0	At December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $273 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_14_ITEM7_P126_S0	A substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P126_S1	Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost.
58492_14_ITEM7_P126_S2	However, due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $50 million of this cash is currently inaccessible for repatriation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P126_S3	Additionally, if we had to bring all of the foreign cash back immediately in the form of dividends, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to approximately $63 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P126_S4	In 2013, 2012, and 2011, we brought back $119 million, $50 million, and $89 million (respectively) of cash, in each case at little to no added tax cost.
58492_14_ITEM7_P127_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2013:
58492_14_ITEM7_P128_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_14_ITEM7_P129_S0	Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_14_ITEM7_P130_S0	Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2013 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P131_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_14_ITEM7_P131_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_14_ITEM7_P131_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_14_ITEM7_P131_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_14_ITEM7_P132_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_14_ITEM7_P133_S0	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM7_P133_S1	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM7_P134_S0	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74.
58492_14_ITEM7_P135_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_14_ITEM7_P135_S1	In the past three years, no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews.
58492_14_ITEM7_P135_S2	In December 2013, we concluded that an impairment was required relating to the goodwill of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) group.
58492_14_ITEM7_P135_S3	A non-cash charge of $63 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_14_ITEM7_P137_S1	Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	The remaining goodwill associated with the CVP reporting unit is $13 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	A further decline in the long-term outlook for the business could result in future impairments.
58492_14_ITEM7_P138_S2	Fair value for one of the 10 reporting units (Store Fixtures) exceeded book value by approximately 18%.
58492_14_ITEM7_P138_S3	The goodwill associated with this reporting unit is $109 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	This business is dependent upon capital spending by retailers for both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	Although 2012 performance was better than expected, 2013 fell short of expectations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	The predictability of future results is less certain than that of other reporting units because of the project nature of this business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P139_S3	If we are not able to meet projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible.
58492_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	The remaining reporting units have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than 40%, and have goodwill of $818 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P142_S1	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C on page 79.
58492_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	Impairments were $2 million in 2013 and 2012, and $35 million in 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	The 2011 impairments were largely the result of lowered future business expectations at several underperforming locations that resulted in the decision to exit some unprofitable lines of business.
58492_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	Prior forecasts assumed a recovery in business levels (primarily housing related industries) that had not materialized by late 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e. not selling very quickly).
58492_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	At December 31, 2013, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $36 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories).
58492_14_ITEM7_P152_S1	This is consistent with the December 31, 2012 and 2011 reserves of $36 million and $39 million, representing 6% and 7% of FIFO inventories, respectively.
58492_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product.
58492_14_ITEM7_P153_S1	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving.
58492_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	Additions to inventory reserves in 2013 were $12 million, which were comparable to the previous year.
58492_14_ITEM7_P156_S1	We do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels.
58492_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay (since we are self-insured).
58492_14_ITEM7_P158_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $9 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P159_S2	At December 31, 2013, we had accrued $35 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	Internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years and are expected to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future.
58492_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	The average annual amount of customer-related bad debt expense was $5 million (less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	At December 31, 2013, our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled $17 million (about 4% of our accounts and customer-related notes receivable of $452 million).
58492_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_14_ITEM7_P166_S1	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	We have not experienced any significant individual customer bankruptcies in the past three years.
58492_14_ITEM7_P167_S1	We believe the financial health of our major customers has modestly improved, but some are highly leveraged, and this could cause circumstances to change in the future.
58492_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	At December 31, 2013, we had $11 million of non-customer notes receivable, primarily related to divested businesses, and have recorded reserves of $1 million for these notes.
58492_14_ITEM7_P168_S1	Most of these notes are to be paid by highly leveraged entities, which could result in the need for additional reserves in the future.
58492_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid, which also impacts current year pension expense.
58492_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	Determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities).
58492_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	Other assumptions include rates of compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates, and retirement ages.
58492_14_ITEM7_P171_S2	These estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P172_S0	The discount rates used to calculate the pension liability for our most significant plans increased approximately 80 basis points in 2013 due to higher corporate bond yields.
58492_14_ITEM7_P172_S1	Each 25 basis point increase in the discount rate decreases pension expense by $.6 million and decreases the plans benefit obligation by $9 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P172_S2	The expected return on assets was 6.6% in 2013 and 2012, and 6.7% in 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P172_S3	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.5 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_14_ITEM7_P174_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM7_P174_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_14_ITEM7_P174_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	We adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $43 million and $39 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
58492_14_ITEM7_P177_S2	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_14_ITEM7_P177_S3	Valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a 50% probability of being realized.
58492_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_14_ITEM7_P178_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	Potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P179_S1	If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed, we would incur additional taxes of approximately $63 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	Audits by various taxing authorities continue to increase as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_14_ITEM7_P180_S1	Based upon past experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	The recovery of net operating losses (NOL s) has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P181_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_14_ITEM7_P181_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_14_ITEM7_P182_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_14_ITEM7_P182_S1	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred, we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss.
58492_14_ITEM7_P183_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_14_ITEM7_P183_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable.
58492_14_ITEM7_P184_S0	Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described beginning on page 54.
58492_14_ITEM7_P184_S1	Over the past five years, the largest annual cost for litigation claims was $6 million (excluding legal fees).
58492_14_ITEM7_P185_S0	As discussed in Note T on page 113, we are defendants in a group of antitrust lawsuits related to alleged price fixing of prime foam and carpet underlay products.
58492_14_ITEM7_P185_S1	We will vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.
58492_14_ITEM7_P185_S2	However, if we are not able to prevail in future court proceedings this could have a negative impact on future cash flows and earnings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P185_S3	Due to the number of variables and uncertainties in this matter, we are unable to estimate the range of potential exposure at this time.
58492_14_ITEM7_P186_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) are based on our assessment of the probability that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost.
58492_14_ITEM7_P186_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally very unpredictable.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC284.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S1	The suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S2	The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S3	The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S4	The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from us.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S5	We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S6	We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and this failure to make demand should not be excused; the dismissal of the substantially similar suit in 2009 precludes the 2010 suit; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S7	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_14_ITEM7_P187_S8	On April 6, 2011, the suit was dismissed without prejudice.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S0	On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S1	On November 28, 2012, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal finding that plaintiff sufficiently pleaded it would be futile to make demand on the Board and shareholders.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S2	The Court of Appeals did not address the other grounds that had been raised in the motions to dismiss.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S3	We filed a request for transfer to the Missouri Supreme Court on December 12, 2012, which was denied by the Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S4	On January 3, 2013, we filed a transfer petition to the Missouri Supreme Court.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S5	On February 26, 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court denied our request.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S6	The case was sent back to Jasper County, Missouri for further proceedings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S7	At the parties' request, on June 4, 2013, the circuit court stayed all proceedings to allow the parties to mediate the dispute.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S8	The stay of litigation remains in effect.
58492_14_ITEM7_P188_S9	We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P189_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_14_ITEM7_P189_S1	A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed, most without prejudice.
58492_14_ITEM7_P189_S2	Of the U.S. cases remaining, we have been named as a defendant in (a) three direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) and a consolidated amended class action complaint filed on February 28, 2011 on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products; (b) an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011; and an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011; (c) 39 individual direct purchaser cases filed between March 22, 2011 and October 16, 2013; and (d) two individual cases alleging direct and indirect purchaser claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, one filed on November 29, 2012 and the other on April 11, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P189_S3	All of the pending U.S. federal cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_14_ITEM7_P189_S4	In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_14_ITEM7_P189_S5	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P190_S0	On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim.
58492_14_ITEM7_P190_S1	On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss.
58492_14_ITEM7_P191_S0	Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P192_S0	Motions for class certification have been filed on behalf of both direct and indirect purchasers.
58492_14_ITEM7_P192_S1	A hearing on the motions was held January 15, 2014.
58492_14_ITEM7_P192_S2	A decision on class certification is expected in the upcoming weeks.
58492_14_ITEM7_P193_S0	Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.
58492_14_ITEM7_P193_S1	in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 (amended November 2, 2011) and CV-11-17279 (issued December 30, 2011).
58492_14_ITEM7_P194_S0	In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 13 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100 million, punitive damages of $10 million, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the investigation and the action.
58492_14_ITEM7_P194_S1	We are not yet required to file our defenses in the Canadian actions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P194_S2	In addition, on July 10, 2012, plaintiff in a class action case (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products) styled Option Consommateurs and Karine Robillard v. Produits Vitafoam Canada Limit e, et.
58492_14_ITEM7_P194_S3	No. 500-6-524-104, filed an amended motion for authorization seeking to add us and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products as defendants in this case.
58492_14_ITEM7_P195_S0	On June 22, 2012, we were also made party to a lawsuit brought in the 16 th Judicial Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, Case Number 1216-CV15179 under the caption Dennis Baker, on Behalf of Himself and all Others Similarly Situated vs. Leggett Platt, Incorporated.
58492_14_ITEM7_P195_S1	The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and/or a class of indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products in the State of Missouri, alleged that we violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act based upon our alleged illegal price inflation of flexible polyurethane foam products.
58492_14_ITEM7_P195_S2	The plaintiff seeks unspecified actual damages, punitive damages and the recovery of reasonable attorney fees.
58492_14_ITEM7_P195_S3	We filed a motion to dismiss this action, which was denied on November 5, 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7_P195_S4	Discovery has commenced and plaintiff has filed a motion for class certification.
58492_14_ITEM7_P195_S5	The parties briefing is completed, and a hearing on the motion was held on February 20, 2014.
58492_14_ITEM7_P196_S0	We deny all of the allegations in all of the above actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_14_ITEM7_P197_S0	These contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_14_ITEM7_P198_S0	discovery is incomplete, all expert liability reports have not been exchanged; and because the litigation involves unsettled legal theories.
58492_14_ITEM7_P199_S0	Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_14_ITEM7_P199_S1	( L P Brazil ) in the amount of $3.1 million, under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_14_ITEM7_P200_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.
58492_14_ITEM7_P200_S1	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P200_S2	The Federal Revenue Office, on August 9, 2013, denied L P Brazil's defenses and upheld the assessment at the first administrative level.
58492_14_ITEM7_P200_S3	L P Brazil was notified about this judgment on October 16, 2013, and has filed an appeal.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S0	No. 10855.725260/2012-36 covering the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 on the same subject matter.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S1	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 17, 2013 denying the violation.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S2	The Brazilian Revenue Office, on June 13, 2013, denied L P Brazil's defenses and upheld the assessment at the first administrative level.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S3	L P Brazil appealed this decision on July 8, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S4	The Brazilian Revenue Office, on December 18, 2013, also issued an audit notice for years 2011 and 2012, which may result in additional assessments.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S5	In addition, L P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012, and September 13, 2013 from the Brazilian Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L P Brazil's use of certain tax credits in the years 2006 through 2010.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S6	Such credits are generated based upon the tariff classification and rate used by L P Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P201_S7	Combined with prior assessments, L P Brazil has received assessments totaling $1.7 million on the same or similar denial of tax credit matters.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S0	L P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking $2.4 million for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n .04-256.169/2009).
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S1	The State of Sao Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S2	On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S3	The State filed a special appeal and the Special Appeals court remanded the case back to the Court of Tax and Fees for further findings.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S4	On November 9, 2012, the Court of Tax and Fees again ruled in favor of L P Brazil and nullified the tax assessment.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S5	On November 28, 2012, the State filed another special appeal.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S6	The determination to accept the special appeal was made on December 26, 2012, and L P Brazil responded to this special appeal on January 24, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S7	We were also informed on October 4, 2012 that the State of Sao Paulo issued an Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine dated May 29, 2012 under Procedure Number 4.003.484 against L P Brazil in the amount of $2.0 million for the tax years 2009 through 2011.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S8	Similar to the prior assessment, the State of Sao Paulo argues that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S9	On June 21, 2013, the State of Sao Paulo's attorneys converted the Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine No. 4.003.484 to a fiscal execution action against L P Brazil in the amount of $2.6 million, under Sorocaba Judicial District Court, Case No. 3005528-50.2013.8.26.0602.
58492_14_ITEM7_P202_S10	L P Brazil filed its response on January 27, 2014 denying the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P203_S0	On December 18, 2012, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil issued a tax assessment to L P Brazil relating to L P Brazil's classifications of innersprings for the collection and payment of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings in Minas Gerais from March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012 in the amount of $.6 million, under PTA Case No. 01.000.182756-62.
58492_14_ITEM7_P203_S1	L P Brazil filed its response denying any violation on January 17, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P204_S0	We appealed to the second administrative level on December 30, 2013, which affirmed the first administrative level ruling.
58492_14_ITEM7_P205_S0	On February 1, 2013, the Brazilian Finance Ministry filed suit against L P Brazil in the Camanducaia Judicial District Court, Case No. 0002222-35.2013.8.13.0878, alleging the untimely payment of $.2 million of social contributions (social security and social assistance payments).
58492_14_ITEM7_P205_S1	L P Brazil filed its response on July 11, 2013, denying the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P205_S2	L P Brazil argued the payments were not required to be made because of the application of certain tax credits that were generated by L P Brazil's use of a tariff code for the classification of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings (i.e., the same underlying issue at stake in the other Brazilian matters).
58492_14_ITEM7_P205_S3	L P Brazil posted a bond and filed its response on July 11, 2013, denying the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P205_S4	We deny all of the allegations in these actions.
58492_14_ITEM7_P205_S5	We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_14_ITEM7_P205_S6	However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_14_ITEM7_P206_S0	Patent Infringement Claim On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 million based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs.
58492_14_ITEM7_P206_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_14_ITEM7_P206_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_14_ITEM7_P206_S3	On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent's validity and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S0	At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S1	The court denied plaintiff's attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S2	On April 9, 2012 we appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S3	Oral argument was held on February 6, 2013 before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C. On February 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 million verdict against us, which was fully accrued for in the first quarter of 2013 and then paid in the second quarter of 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S4	We filed a petition for a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision on March 18, 2013, which was denied by the Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S5	The plaintiff requested royalties for post-verdict use of the machines, and requested pre-judgment interest in the amount of $.7 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S6	On July 3, 2013, the District Court ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to additional ongoing royalties for our continued use of the machines, but did award pre-judgment interest of $.5 million.
58492_14_ITEM7_P207_S7	On August 2, 2013, both parties filed a notice of appeal of this order to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but plaintiff has since withdrawn its appeal.
58492_14_ITEM7_P208_S0	In 2011, we also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue in the lawsuit the plaintiff brought.
58492_14_ITEM7_P208_S1	The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the key claims of one of the three patents.
58492_14_ITEM7_P208_S2	The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second of the patents, but subsequently reversed that decision.
58492_14_ITEM7_P208_S3	With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office's examiner decision upheld the validity of all claims.
58492_14_ITEM7_P208_S4	All three of these proceedings were appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM7_P209_S0	Due to a change made to all of the machines, we do not believe that the machines currently use the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.
58492_14_ITEM7_P210_S0	On April 25, 2013, the plaintiff filed petitions to terminate all re-examination proceedings based on the final ruling of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM7_P210_S1	The Patent Office terminated all three re-examination proceedings, two on December 16, and one on December 18, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM7_P211_S0	On July 29, 2013, the plaintiff filed a second lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No.
58492_14_ITEM7_P211_S1	CV13-05463 alleging that we and Simmons Bedding Company have continued to infringe the three patents on an automatic stapling machine and the methods used to assemble box springs, and that the plaintiff is entitled to additional damages from January 24, 2012 forward.
58492_14_ITEM7_P211_S2	Leggett and Simmons Bedding Company filed their Answers on November 20, 2013, and intend to vigorously defend the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P212_S0	At this time, we do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM7_P213_S0	As discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77, the FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods.

58492_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The table below provides information about the Company s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The fair value of fixed rate debt was less than its $830 carrying value by $3.2 at December 31, 2013, and greater than its $1,030 carrying value by $45.7 at December 31, 2012.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The decrease in the fair market value of the Company s debt is primarily due to the maturity of $200 of notes in 2013, the increase in credit spreads as compared to the prior year end, increased interest rates, and the timing of interest payments.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2013 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Company s interest costs for its medium-term notes.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	These rates exclude the amortization of interest rate swap.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	It is the Company s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_14_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair value hedges is provided in Note S on page 110 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.

58492_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

58492_14_ITEM10_P2_S2	If a nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in the director election, the N CG Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the director s resignation and whether any other action should be taken.
58492_14_ITEM10_P2_S3	If a director s resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company s next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.
58492_14_ITEM10_P2_S4	If the Board accepts the director s resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy.
58492_14_ITEM10_P3_S0	The Company s Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines set the director retirement age at 72; however, the Board Chair, CEO or President may request a waiver for any director.
58492_14_ITEM10_P3_S1	At the request of Leggett s CEO, the N CG Committee recommended, and the full Board granted, retirement age waivers for Directors Clark, Enloe and Fisher so they may stand for re-election at the 2014 annual meeting.

58492_14_ITEM15_P1_S0	The Reports, Financial Statements and Notes, supplementary financial information and Financial Statement Schedule listed below are included in this Form 10-K:
58492_14_ITEM15_P2_S0	We have omitted other information schedules because the information is inapplicable, not required, or in the financial statements or notes.
58492_14_ITEM15_P3_S0	(b) Exhibits See Exhibit Index beginning on page 121.
58492_14_ITEM15_P4_S0	We did not file other long-term debt instruments because the total amount of securities authorized under any of these instruments does not exceed ten percent of the total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
58492_14_ITEM15_P4_S1	The Company agrees to furnish a copy of such instruments to the SEC upon request.
58492_14_ITEM15_P5_S0	Management of Leggett Platt, Incorporated is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
58492_14_ITEM15_P5_S1	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_14_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
58492_14_ITEM15_P6_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett Platt assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_14_ITEM15_P8_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2013 , based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
58492_14_ITEM15_P8_S1	Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P9_S0	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2013 , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 68 of this Form 10-K.
58492_14_ITEM15_P10_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Leggett Platt, Incorporated:
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
58492_14_ITEM15_P11_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
58492_14_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

58492_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries ( we or our ).
58492_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States.
58492_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies.
58492_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	Legal costs are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
58492_14_ITEM15_P22_S1	If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable.
58492_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	Legal fees are accrued when incurred.
58492_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	Other notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business.
58492_14_ITEM15_P25_S3	Other notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	Interest income is not recognized for accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
58492_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_14_ITEM15_P29_S2	The cost for approximately 55% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_14_ITEM15_P29_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P29_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	We have had no material changes in inventory writedowns or slow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves in any of the years presented.
58492_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:
58492_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	A business is classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_14_ITEM15_P35_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_14_ITEM15_P36_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_14_ITEM15_P36_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell.
58492_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	Property is reviewed for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	Our reporting units are the 10 business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.
58492_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group.
58492_14_ITEM15_P49_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the business groups.
58492_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price-to-earnings ratios.
58492_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P52_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_14_ITEM15_P55_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_14_ITEM15_P55_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_14_ITEM15_P55_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers.
58492_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_14_ITEM15_P62_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_14_ITEM15_P64_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute engineered products for the various end markets described in Note F.
58492_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.
58492_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of other notes receivable.
58492_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Other notes receivable primarily consist of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business.
58492_14_ITEM15_P67_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_14_ITEM15_P69_S0	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_14_ITEM15_P70_S0	To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_14_ITEM15_P70_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P71_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_14_ITEM15_P72_S1	Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.
58492_14_ITEM15_P72_S2	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon reasonable estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P73_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P74_S2	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_14_ITEM15_P74_S3	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_14_ITEM15_P77_S1	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_14_ITEM15_P77_S2	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.
58492_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_14_ITEM15_P79_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_14_ITEM15_P81_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2013 presentation, primarily in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and all related notes in which prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain operations to discontinued operations (See Note B).
58492_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	The FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods.
58492_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	This guidance did not have a material impact on our current financial statements, and we do not believe it will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	In the second quarter of 2013 we exited three small operations:
58492_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	We closed our final location that produced wire dishwasher racks, thereby discontinuing that line of business.
58492_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	This operation, which was previously in our Industrial Materials segment, was part of a restructuring plan that began in the fourth quarter of 2011 as discussed in Note D.
58492_14_ITEM15_P85_S2	We also incurred impairment charges related to these operations in 2011 and 2012 as discussed in Note C. Tax benefits related to this business were recorded in the second quarters of both 2012 and 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	We divested the specialty trailers portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) unit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P86_S1	This branch was previously part of the Specialized Products segment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P86_S2	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business.
58492_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	We closed a cotton-based erosion control products operation that was previously part of the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P87_S1	Charges of $1.9 were recorded in the second quarter of 2013 to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, including $1.5 of fixed asset impairments as discussed in Note C.
58492_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	The table below includes activity related to these operations:
58492_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	(1) Subsequent activity for businesses divested in prior years has been reported as discontinued operations in the table above, including a cash litigation settlement received in 2012 associated with our former Prime Foam Products unit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	This unit was sold in March 2007 and was previously part of the Residential Furnishings segment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	(2) 2013 and 2012 tax benefits are related to a worthless stock deduction and the excess outside tax basis of the subsidiary that produced wire dishwasher racks.
58492_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.
58492_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	As discussed in Note A, other long-lived assets are reviewed for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	In December 2011, management approved the 2011 Restructuring Plan which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming facilities and resulted in impairment charges of $31.2 ( $19.0 for intangibles and $12.2 for fixed assets).
58492_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	In 2012, approximately $1.2 of fixed asset impairments were related to this plan.
58492_14_ITEM15_P95_S2	We also incurred restructuring and restructuring-related charges associated with this plan as discussed in Note D.
58492_14_ITEM15_P95_S3	This plan included operations that produced wire dishwasher racks, the final location of which was closed in second quarter of 2013 and is now reported within discontinued operations as discussed in Note B.
58492_14_ITEM15_P96_S0	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year and as triggering events occur.
58492_14_ITEM15_P96_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year as discussed in Note A.
58492_14_ITEM15_P97_S0	Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach.
58492_14_ITEM15_P97_S1	Each method is generally given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P97_S2	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_14_ITEM15_P97_S3	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P97_S4	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price-to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years.
58492_14_ITEM15_P98_S2	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium.
58492_14_ITEM15_P98_S3	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_14_ITEM15_P98_S4	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_14_ITEM15_P98_S5	Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_14_ITEM15_P99_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_14_ITEM15_P100_S0	Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10 -year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, sales growth, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P101_S0	If a triggering event occurs, special consideration is given to the new circumstances when determining the fair value of the impacted reporting unit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P102_S0	The goodwill impairment reviews performed in June of each year presented indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P103_S0	During 2013, we began considering strategic alternatives for our CVP unit, including possible divestiture of the business.
58492_14_ITEM15_P103_S1	Potential buyers' initial indications of value received during the second and third quarters were reasonably consistent with our fair value estimates used for the annual goodwill impairment test performed in June 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P104_S0	During 2013's fourth quarter, performance of the business deteriorated.
58492_14_ITEM15_P104_S1	It became apparent in December 2013 that current market values for CVP's assets had fallen below recorded book values.
58492_14_ITEM15_P104_S2	This decline in market values of the assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and profitability, reflecting reduced market demand for the racks, shelving, and cabinets used in telecom, cable and delivery vans.
58492_14_ITEM15_P105_S0	The events of the fourth quarter were considered a triggering event, which required us to perform an impairment review.
58492_14_ITEM15_P105_S1	Because the held for sale criteria for the CVP unit was not met, it was evaluated for impairment in December under the held for use model.
58492_14_ITEM15_P105_S2	No long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill) were indicated during the fourth quarter review.
58492_14_ITEM15_P105_S3	However, we also evaluated the remaining useful life for the intangibles resulting in accelerated amortization of $3.8 in the fourth quarter for selected CVP customer-related intangibles.
58492_14_ITEM15_P106_S0	We determined fair value for the first step of the interim goodwill impairment test based upon market multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics as well as multiples derived from offers received during potential sale negotiations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P106_S1	These multiples were applied to lower profitability estimates, which was the result of CVP's fourth quarter business deterioration.
58492_14_ITEM15_P106_S2	Because fair value had fallen below recorded book values, we performed the second step of the test which requires a fair value assessment of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to calculate an implied goodwill amount, and a $63.0 goodwill impairment charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P107_S0	Reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in 2013 are presented in the table below.
58492_14_ITEM15_P108_S0	The 10-25% category below includes information for one reporting unit (Store Fixtures).
58492_14_ITEM15_P108_S1	The fair value of this unit exceeded its book value by 18% at the June 30, 2013 impairment review date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P108_S2	If actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations, we could incur future impairment charges.
58492_14_ITEM15_P109_S0	(1) Includes $13.0 book value of CVP goodwill remaining after the 2013 fourth quarter impairment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P110_S0	We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_14_ITEM15_P110_S1	These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P110_S2	Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended December 31 were comprised of:
58492_14_ITEM15_P111_S0	In December 2011, we adopted the 2011 Restructuring Plan which included the closure of four underperforming manufacturing facilities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P112_S0	The following table contains information, by segment, regarding the amount of each major type of restructuring-related cost incurred in connection with the exit activities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P113_S0	______________________________ The above table includes cash charges incurred to date of $4.4 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P114_S0	(1) Restructuring charges are reported on the Statements of Operations in Other (income) expense, net.
58492_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	The accrued liability associated with the 2011 Restructuring Plan consisted of the following:
58492_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	We also incurred impairment costs associated with this plan as discussed in Note C.
58492_14_ITEM15_P116_S1	These exit activities were substantially complete by the end of 2012 and no additional significant costs related to the plan are expected.
58492_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	Apart from the 2011 Restructuring Plan, we have implemented various cost reduction initiatives over the last three years to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	None of these actions have individually resulted in a material charge to earnings.
58492_14_ITEM15_P117_S2	Total costs associated with these other initiatives have had the following impact on our financial statements:
58492_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	Restructuring and restructuring-related charges (income) by segment for the other initiatives were as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	The accrued liability associated with the other initiatives consisted of the following:
58492_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	(1) In the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $63.0 related to the CVP unit as outlined in Note C.
58492_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset class and intangible assets acquired during the period presented included in "Other intangibles" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	Estimated amortization expense for items included in our December 31, 2013 balance sheet in each of the next five years is as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	We have four operating segments that supply a wide range of products:
58492_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_14_ITEM15_P125_S1	Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating officer.
58492_14_ITEM15_P125_S2	The chief operating officer in turn reports directly to the chief operating decision maker.
58492_14_ITEM15_P125_S3	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory.
58492_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	We evaluate performance based on earnings from operations before interest and income taxes (EBIT).
58492_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices.
58492_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales.
58492_14_ITEM15_P130_S2	These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	A summary of segment results for the periods presented are shown in the following tables.
58492_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance.
58492_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P132_S2	Segment assets for all years are reflected at their estimated average for the year.
58492_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	Acquired companies long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	(1) Businesses sold or classified as discontinued operations during the years presented.

58492_14_ITEM15_P135_S1	Unallocated depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of nonoperating assets and amortization of debt issue costs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	Revenues from external customers, by product line, are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	Our principal operations outside of the United States are presented in the following geographic information, based on the area of manufacture.
58492_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:

58492_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 of commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 13 lenders.
58492_14_ITEM15_P145_S1	This agreement was renewed in 2011, with a five years term ending in 2016.
58492_14_ITEM15_P145_S2	During the third quarter of 2013 we extended the term by one year to 2017.
58492_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	The credit agreement allows us to issue total letters of credit up to $250 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P146_S1	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_14_ITEM15_P146_S2	We had no outstanding letters of credit under the agreement at year end for the periods presented.
58492_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	The revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit a) the total amount of indebtedness to 60% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit agreement), b) the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) the amount of assets sold, transferred or disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 20% of total consolidated assets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P148_S1	We have remained well within compliance with all such covenants.
58492_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	We may elect one of four types of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance.
58492_14_ITEM15_P149_S1	various published rates plus a pre-defined spread.
58492_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	We are required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P150_S1	Any outstanding principal under this agreement will be due upon the maturity date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P150_S2	We may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under this agreement, in whole or in part, upon three business days notice.
58492_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	We lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P151_S1	Lease terms, including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs, vary by lease.
58492_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	Total rental expense for the periods presented was as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P153_S0	Future minimum rental commitments for all long-term non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P154_S0	The above lease obligations expire at various dates through 2019.
58492_14_ITEM15_P154_S1	Aggregate rental commitments above include renewal amounts where it is our intention to renew the lease.
58492_14_ITEM15_P155_S0	We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.
58492_14_ITEM15_P156_S0	One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.
58492_14_ITEM15_P157_S0	Shares are issued from treasury for the majority of our stock plans activity.
58492_14_ITEM15_P157_S1	All share information is presented in millions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P158_S0	Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan.
58492_14_ITEM15_P159_S0	On May 10, 2012 the Flexible Stock Plan changed the way awards granted under the Plan are charged against the number of available shares.
58492_14_ITEM15_P159_S1	Under the 2012 Plan modification, each option counts as one share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as three shares against the Plan.
58492_14_ITEM15_P160_S0	At December 31, 2013, the following common shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:
58492_14_ITEM15_P161_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation (including discontinued operations) on the results of operations for each of the periods presented:
58492_14_ITEM15_P162_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on assets and liabilities for each of the periods presented:
58492_14_ITEM15_P163_S0	When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a windfall tax benefit is created.
58492_14_ITEM15_P163_S1	The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital.
58492_14_ITEM15_P164_S0	When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax shortfall is created.
58492_14_ITEM15_P164_S1	To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls, the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital.
58492_14_ITEM15_P165_S0	We have granted stock options in the following areas:
58492_14_ITEM15_P166_S0	We have historically granted stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_14_ITEM15_P166_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months , 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P166_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P167_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are amortized by the straight-line method over the options total vesting period, except for employees who terminate due to retirement.
58492_14_ITEM15_P168_S0	A retirement termination occurs if the employee is age 65 , or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination.
58492_14_ITEM15_P168_S1	For retirement terminations, options continue to vest and remain exercisable for three years, six months after termination of employment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P168_S2	Therefore, the expense for these options is accelerated when the employee is retirement eligible.
58492_14_ITEM15_P169_S0	In connection with the January 2011 and 2012 grants, we offered two different option choice programs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P169_S1	One group of employees was offered the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone.
58492_14_ITEM15_P169_S2	Another group of employees, generally higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of four options foregone for every one RSU offered.
58492_14_ITEM15_P169_S3	The stock units vest in one-third increments at 12 months , 24 months and 36 months after the date of grant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P170_S0	Starting in 2013, we discontinued the annual option grant, and options are now offered only in conjunction with the Deferred Compensation Program discussed below, and were replaced with either cash awards or RSUs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P171_S0	Certain key management employees participated in a new Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI) program beginning in 2013, as discussed below.
58492_14_ITEM15_P172_S0	We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_14_ITEM15_P173_S0	Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_14_ITEM15_P173_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five , divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P173_S2	The option has a 10 -year term.
58492_14_ITEM15_P173_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on each acquisition date and they vest immediately.
58492_14_ITEM15_P176_S0	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_14_ITEM15_P176_S1	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_14_ITEM15_P176_S2	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_14_ITEM15_P176_S3	Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.
58492_14_ITEM15_P177_S0	may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_14_ITEM15_P177_S1	Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.
58492_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.
58492_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	Stock option information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program.
58492_14_ITEM15_P180_S1	During 2013, .1 options were exercised at a below market exercise price, and .1 of these options remain outstanding at December 31, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	In 2005, we amended the Program to provide only at market stock options.
58492_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	Additional information related to stock option activity for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
58492_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option.
58492_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees.
58492_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility, measured daily for a time period equal to the option s expected life, ending on the day of grant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P186_S1	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_14_ITEM15_P187_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_14_ITEM15_P187_S2	In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.
58492_14_ITEM15_P188_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_14_ITEM15_P188_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P188_S2	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service.
58492_14_ITEM15_P189_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_14_ITEM15_P190_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_14_ITEM15_P190_S1	Participant contributions are credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we make premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_14_ITEM15_P190_S2	A participant s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P190_S3	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units.
58492_14_ITEM15_P190_S4	The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company that will be settled in cash.
58492_14_ITEM15_P190_S5	Both the assets and liabilities associated with this program are presented in the table above and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P191_S0	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions in the form of stock units.
58492_14_ITEM15_P191_S1	Company contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P191_S2	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program and may be settled in cash at the discretion of the Company.
58492_14_ITEM15_P192_S0	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P192_S1	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.
58492_14_ITEM15_P193_S0	Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.
58492_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	We also grant Performance Stock Unit (PSU) awards in the first quarter of each year to selected officers and other key managers.
58492_14_ITEM15_P195_S1	These awards contain the following conditions:
58492_14_ITEM15_P196_S0	Beginning Stock Price] as compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies.
58492_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S P 500 and S P Midcap 400 (approximately 320 companies).
58492_14_ITEM15_P197_S1	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our Total Shareholder Return ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3 -year performance period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P198_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies.
58492_14_ITEM15_P198_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three -year vesting period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P199_S0	Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU s for the periods presented:
58492_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	Beginning with the 2010 award (that was settled in January 2013), thirty-five percent ( 35% ) of awards will be paid out in cash.
58492_14_ITEM15_P200_S1	We intend to pay out the remaining sixty-five percent ( 65% ) in shares of our common stock, although we reserve the right to pay up to one hundred percent ( 100% ) in cash.
58492_14_ITEM15_P200_S2	The 35% portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P201_S0	RSU awards are generally granted as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P202_S0	The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P203_S0	Starting in 2013, certain key management employees participated in a new Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI) program in lieu of the annual option grant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P203_S1	The PGI awards are issued as growth performance stock units (GPSUs).
58492_14_ITEM15_P203_S2	The GPSUs vest ( 0% to 250% ) at the end of a two -year performance period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P203_S3	Vesting is based on the Company's or applicable profit center's revenue growth (adjusted by a GDP factor when applicable) and EBITDA margin at the end of a two-year performance period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P203_S4	The 2013 base target PGI award was .1 shares.
58492_14_ITEM15_P203_S5	If earned, we intend to pay half in shares of our common stock and half in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_14_ITEM15_P203_S6	Both components are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P204_S0	Stock unit information for the plans discussed above is presented in the table below.
58492_14_ITEM15_P205_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the unrecognized cost of non-vested stock options and units was as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P206_S0	Under the Discount Stock Plan (DSP), a tax-qualified 423 stock purchase plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of Leggett common stock at 85% of the closing market price on the last business day of each month.
58492_14_ITEM15_P206_S1	Shares are purchased and issued on the last business day of each month and generally cannot be sold or transferred for one year.
58492_14_ITEM15_P207_S0	The accompanying balance sheets reflect a net liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
58492_14_ITEM15_P207_S1	Our U.S. plans (comprised primarily of three significant plans) represent approximately 88% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.
58492_14_ITEM15_P207_S2	Participants in one of the significant domestic plans have stopped earning benefits; this plan is referred to as "frozen" in the following narrative.
58492_14_ITEM15_P208_S0	A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P209_S0	Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below:
58492_14_ITEM15_P210_S0	Included in the above plans is a subsidiary s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.
58492_14_ITEM15_P210_S1	This is a non-qualified plan, and the subsidiary owns insurance policies for the participants that are not included in the plan s assets with cash surrender values at December 31 as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P211_S0	Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions are reflected below:
58492_14_ITEM15_P212_S0	Of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2013, the portions expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in 2014 are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P213_S0	Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P214_S0	Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.
58492_14_ITEM15_P215_S0	We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points).
58492_14_ITEM15_P216_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P216_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_14_ITEM15_P217_S0	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P218_S0	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings, as discussed below.
58492_14_ITEM15_P219_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that separates fair value valuation techniques into the following categories:
58492_14_ITEM15_P220_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P221_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_14_ITEM15_P222_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_14_ITEM15_P223_S0	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_14_ITEM15_P224_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P224_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P225_S0	Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_14_ITEM15_P225_S1	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P225_S2	In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_14_ITEM15_P226_S0	Of our three significant domestic plans, the frozen plan (representing approximately 60% of the total benefit obligation) employs a Liability Driven Investment strategy and has a target allocation of 60% fixed income and 40% equities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P226_S1	The remaining significant plans have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% fixed income, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_14_ITEM15_P227_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to six different passively managed low-cost index mutual funds:
58492_14_ITEM15_P228_S0	Total Stock Market Index: Large -, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_14_ITEM15_P229_S0	Large-Cap Index: Large-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_14_ITEM15_P230_S0	Small-Cap Index: Small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_14_ITEM15_P231_S0	FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world.
58492_14_ITEM15_P232_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market.
58492_14_ITEM15_P233_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market.
58492_14_ITEM15_P234_S0	We expect to contribute $3.4 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2014.
58492_14_ITEM15_P235_S0	Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P236_S0	Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P237_S0	We have limited participation in two union-sponsored, defined benefit, multi-employer pension plans.
58492_14_ITEM15_P237_S1	We participated in one multi-employer plan in 2011, and added one additional plan with the Western Pneumatic acquisition in 2012 (as discussed in Note R).
58492_14_ITEM15_P238_S0	These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provision of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_14_ITEM15_P238_S1	Aggregate contributions to these plans were less than $.6 for each of the years presented.
58492_14_ITEM15_P239_S0	In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if a plan has unfunded vested benefits.
58492_14_ITEM15_P239_S1	Factors that could impact the funded status of these plans include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P240_S0	We have a very small share of the liability among the participants of these plans.
58492_14_ITEM15_P240_S1	Based upon the information available from plan administrators, both of the multi-employer plans in which we participate are underfunded and estimate our aggregate share of potential withdrawal liability for both plans to be $23.2 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P240_S2	We have not recorded any material withdrawal liabilities for the years presented.
58492_14_ITEM15_P241_S0	The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P242_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
58492_14_ITEM15_P243_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P244_S0	For all periods presented, the tax rate benefited from income earned in various foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily related to China and Luxembourg.
58492_14_ITEM15_P244_S1	Significant items impacting each year's tax rate follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P245_S0	We recognized tax rate benefits totaling $17.5 , primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_14_ITEM15_P245_S1	The tax rate benefited from the elimination of a $36.9 valuation allowance on our Canadian net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P245_S2	As a result of an increase in operating earnings in Canada, the amalgamation of two Canadian subsidiaries, and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in Canadian tax law, we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years.
58492_14_ITEM15_P245_S3	This 2012 benefit was partially offset by the accrual of $11.2 of deferred withholding taxes in China on earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested in China.
58492_14_ITEM15_P246_S0	2011: The tax rate benefited by a total of $5.2 from the release of certain deferred tax asset valuation allowances and tax audit settlements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P246_S1	In 2011, we also incurred $1.7 of incremental tax on the 2010 repatriation of $112.6 of earnings from foreign subsidiaries.
58492_14_ITEM15_P247_S0	We recognized net excess tax benefits of approximately $4.6 , $5.5 , and $6.1 , and in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, related to stock plan activity, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital.
58492_14_ITEM15_P247_S1	These amounts include net windfall tax benefits as discussed in Note L.
58492_14_ITEM15_P248_S0	We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_14_ITEM15_P248_S1	In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_14_ITEM15_P248_S2	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities may no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_14_ITEM15_P248_S3	In addition, we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_14_ITEM15_P249_S0	The total amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013, is $32.9 , of which $18.0 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_14_ITEM15_P249_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P250_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_14_ITEM15_P251_S0	As of December 31, 2013, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2010 through 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P251_S1	In 2011, IRS examinations of the 2004 through 2008 tax returns were completed, and in 2012 refunds aggregating $15.6 were received for all years associated with the audit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P251_S2	In 2011, we adjusted our reserve for uncertain tax positions with respect to the largest issue in connection with the examination, related to worthless stock deductions, which had a favorable impact on our tax provision of $3.6 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P252_S0	Additionally, at December 31, 2013, five tax years were undergoing audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2007 through 2011.
58492_14_ITEM15_P252_S1	These examinations are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any material adjustments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P252_S2	In 2013, due to Canada Revenue Agency examinations of our 2005 and 2006 tax years, we released $1.1 of unrecognized tax benefits.
58492_14_ITEM15_P252_S3	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years also remain open to examination, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P253_S0	It is reasonably possible that resolution of certain tax audits could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, as certain tax positions may be sustained on audit, or we may agree to certain adjustments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P253_S1	It is not expected that any change would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P254_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P254_S1	The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P255_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_14_ITEM15_P255_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_14_ITEM15_P256_S0	These loss and credit carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, with no amount greater than $10 expiring in any one year.
58492_14_ITEM15_P257_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_14_ITEM15_P258_S0	The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.
58492_14_ITEM15_P258_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we have accrued $10.1 of deferred taxes associated with the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
58492_14_ITEM15_P259_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested.
58492_14_ITEM15_P259_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings which are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2013, are $375.1 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P259_S2	If such earnings were distributed, the resulting incremental tax expense would be $62.6 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.
58492_14_ITEM15_P260_S0	In 2013, we repatriated $68.0 of foreign earnings, resulting in a net tax benefit of $2.3 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P260_S1	Although we have not changed our assertion with respect to amounts permanently reinvested outside the U.S., in 2012 we recorded $11.2 , which was reduced by $1.1 in 2013, for withholding taxes in China, since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all of our Chinese earnings within China.
58492_14_ITEM15_P260_S2	These taxes would be due on dividends from certain of our China subsidiaries to their foreign parent, a subsidiary of the U.S. company.
58492_14_ITEM15_P260_S3	These earnings are still permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and are included in the undistributed earnings and incremental taxes discussed above.
58492_14_ITEM15_P261_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P262_S0	The components of other (income) expense from continuing operations were as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P263_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_14_ITEM15_P264_S0	We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P265_S0	The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.
58492_14_ITEM15_P266_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_14_ITEM15_P267_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P268_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_14_ITEM15_P268_S1	Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_14_ITEM15_P268_S2	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_14_ITEM15_P268_S3	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_14_ITEM15_P268_S4	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_14_ITEM15_P269_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_14_ITEM15_P270_S0	* - Includes both current and long-term amounts combined.
58492_14_ITEM15_P271_S0	The fair value for fixed rate debt (Level 2) was less than its $830.0 carrying value by $3.2 at December 31, 2013 and greater than its $1,030.0 carrying value by $45.7 at December 31, 2012.
58492_14_ITEM15_P271_S1	We value this debt using discounted cash flow and secondary market rates provided by Bloomberg.
58492_14_ITEM15_P272_S0	The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets (including goodwill) for potential impairment as discussed in Note C. Determining fair values for these items requires significant judgment and includes a variety of methods and models that utilize significant Level 3 inputs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P273_S0	Long-lived assets, acquisitions and the second step of a goodwill impairment test utilize the following methodologies in determining fair value: (i) Buildings and machinery are valued at an estimated replacement cost for an asset of comparable age and condition.
58492_14_ITEM15_P273_S1	Market pricing of comparable assets are used to estimate replacement cost where available.
58492_14_ITEM15_P274_S0	The most common identified intangible assets are customer relationships and tradenames.
58492_14_ITEM15_P274_S1	Customer relationships are valued using an excess earnings method, using various inputs such as the estimated customer attrition rate, future earnings forecast, the amount of contributory asset charges, and a discount rate.
58492_14_ITEM15_P274_S2	Tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty method, which is based upon comparable market royalty rates for tradenames of similar value.
58492_14_ITEM15_P275_S0	(iii) Inventory is valued at current replacement cost for raw materials, with a step-up for work in process and finished goods items that reflects the amount of ultimate profit earned as the valuation date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P275_S1	(iv) Other working capital items are generally recorded at face value, unless there are known conditions that would impact the ultimate settlement amount of the particular item.
58492_14_ITEM15_P276_S0	The following table contains the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P276_S1	The majority of the goodwill included in the table below is expected to provide an income tax benefit.
58492_14_ITEM15_P277_S0	The following table summarizes acquisitions for the periods presented.
58492_14_ITEM15_P278_S0	We are finalizing all of the information required to complete the purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_14_ITEM15_P279_S0	During third quarter 2013, we acquired an aerospace tubing manufacturer based in France for a cash purchase price of $14.5 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P279_S1	This business was acquired at a price less than fair value of the net identifiable assets, and we recorded an $8.8 non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_14_ITEM15_P279_S2	The bargain purchase gain is reported in the "Other (income) expense, net" line of our income statement.
58492_14_ITEM15_P279_S3	We have assessed the key valuation assumptions and business combination accounting procedures for this acquisition and believe the recognition of a bargain purchase gain is appropriate for this acquisition.
58492_14_ITEM15_P279_S4	Factors that contributed to the bargain purchase price were:
58492_14_ITEM15_P280_S0	The seller of this business will continue to purchase these products in the future.
58492_14_ITEM15_P280_S1	Due to the unique nature of the products and limited number of potential buyers for this business, it was important to the seller that the acquiring company was a financially sound, integrated manufacturer.
58492_14_ITEM15_P281_S0	our demonstrated ability to operate similar businesses, and financial strength that will enable us to be a long-term supplier of quality products into the future, and; We were able to complete the acquisition without a financial contingency, which was an important attribute for the seller.
58492_14_ITEM15_P282_S0	During the first quarter 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western) for a cash purchase price of $188.2 forming the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.
58492_14_ITEM15_P282_S1	Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P283_S0	Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included Western's competitive position, and its fit with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.
58492_14_ITEM15_P284_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_14_ITEM15_P284_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2013 and 2012 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_14_ITEM15_P284_S2	However, Western's activity is incremental to the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P285_S0	Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash, at a later date and, are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P285_S1	At December 31, 2013, there was no substantial remaining consideration payable.
58492_14_ITEM15_P286_S0	In addition, in 2012, we invested $22.4 to acquire an interest in an unconsolidated entity related to a potential acquisition.
58492_14_ITEM15_P286_S1	We had no contractual right or obligation to make any additional investment and liquidated our position in the 3rd quarter of 2013 for $21.2 , plus $1.8 in interest.
58492_14_ITEM15_P287_S0	We also increased our ownership portion to 100% for the following businesses that were previously not wholly owned:
58492_14_ITEM15_P288_S0	We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P288_S1	In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks.
58492_14_ITEM15_P288_S2	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P288_S3	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P289_S0	Derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:
58492_14_ITEM15_P290_S0	Commodity Cash Flow Hedges We have historically used commodity cash flow hedges primarily to manage natural gas commodity price risk.
58492_14_ITEM15_P290_S1	Our last natural gas commodity hedge expired during 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P291_S0	Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges On August 12, 2012, we issued $300 of 10 -year notes with a coupon rate of 3.40% .
58492_14_ITEM15_P291_S1	As a part of this transaction, we settled our $200 forward starting interest rate swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of $42.7 , which will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense over the life of the notes.
58492_14_ITEM15_P292_S0	The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_14_ITEM15_P293_S0	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted.
58492_14_ITEM15_P294_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_14_ITEM15_P295_S0	Our fair value hedges typically manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries assets and liabilities.
58492_14_ITEM15_P296_S0	Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings.
58492_14_ITEM15_P296_S1	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_14_ITEM15_P297_S0	We have deemed ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness.
58492_14_ITEM15_P297_S1	If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of operations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P298_S0	We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P298_S1	The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.
58492_14_ITEM15_P299_S0	Other Current Liabilities Cash flow hedges:
58492_14_ITEM15_P300_S0	The following table sets forth the pre-tax (gains) losses from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented.
58492_14_ITEM15_P301_S0	This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.
58492_14_ITEM15_P302_S0	We are a defendant in various proceedings involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
58492_14_ITEM15_P302_S1	When it is probable, in management's judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_14_ITEM15_P302_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings, and the total liabilities recorded are not material to our financial position.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S0	Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On August 10, 2010, a shareholder derivative suit was filed by the New England Carpenters Pension Fund in the Circuit Court of Jasper County, Missouri as Case No. 10AO-CC284.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S1	The suit was purportedly brought on our behalf, naming us as a nominal defendant, and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including David S. Haffner, Karl G. Glassman, Matthew C. Flanigan, Ernest C. Jett, Harry M. Cornell, Jr., Felix E. Wright, Robert Ted Enloe, III, Richard T. Fisher, Judy C. Odom, Maurice E. Purnell, Jr., Ralph W. Clark and Michael A. Glauber.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S2	The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the individual defendants: breached their fiduciary duties; backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans; caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements; sold our stock while possessing material non-public information; committed gross mismanagement; wasted corporate assets; committed fraud; violated the Missouri Securities Act; and were unjustly enriched.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S3	The plaintiff is seeking, among other things: unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants; certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct; the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals; the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds; punitive damages; the rescission of certain unexercised options; and the reimbursement of litigation costs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S4	The plaintiff is not seeking monetary relief from us.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S5	We have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S6	We and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late October 2010, asserting: the plaintiff failed to make demand on our Board and shareholders as required by Missouri law, and this failure to make demand should not be excused; the dismissal of the substantially similar suit in 2009 precludes the 2010 suit; the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder; the suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed; the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim; the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity; and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the December 30, 2005 grant.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S7	As to this grant, the motions to dismiss advised the Court that it was made under our Deferred Compensation Program, which (i) provided that options would be dated on the last business day of December, and (ii) was filed with the SEC on December 2, 2005 setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date.
58492_14_ITEM15_P303_S8	On April 6, 2011, the suit was dismissed without prejudice.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S0	On May 12, 2011, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S1	On November 28, 2012, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's dismissal finding that plaintiff sufficiently pleaded it would be futile to make demand on the Board and shareholders.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S2	The Court of Appeals did not address the other grounds that had been raised in the motions to dismiss.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S3	We filed a request for transfer to the Missouri Supreme Court on December 12, 2012, which was denied by the Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S4	On January 3, 2013, we filed a transfer petition to the Missouri Supreme Court.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S5	On February 26, 2013, the Missouri Supreme Court denied our request.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S6	The case was sent back to Jasper County, Missouri for further proceedings.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S7	At the parties' request, on June 4, 2013, the circuit court stayed all proceedings to allow the parties to mediate the dispute.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S8	The stay of litigation remains in effect.
58492_14_ITEM15_P304_S9	We do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P305_S0	Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against over 20 defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_14_ITEM15_P305_S1	A number of these lawsuits have been voluntarily dismissed, most without prejudice.
58492_14_ITEM15_P306_S0	filed on November 29, 2012 and the other on April 11, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P306_S1	All of the pending U.S. federal cases in which we have been named as a defendant, have been filed in or have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_14_ITEM15_P306_S2	In the U.S. actions, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek three times the amount of unspecified damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_14_ITEM15_P306_S3	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P307_S0	On April 15 and May 6, 2011, we filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser and indirect purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim.
58492_14_ITEM15_P307_S1	On July 19, 2011, the Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss.
58492_14_ITEM15_P308_S0	Discovery is underway in the U.S. actions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P309_S0	Motions for class certification have been filed on behalf of both direct and indirect purchasers.
58492_14_ITEM15_P309_S1	A hearing on the motions was held January 15, 2014.
58492_14_ITEM15_P309_S2	A decision on class certification is expected in the upcoming weeks.
58492_14_ITEM15_P310_S0	Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.
58492_14_ITEM15_P310_S1	in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 (amended November 2, 2011) and CV-11-17279 (issued December 30, 2011).
58492_14_ITEM15_P311_S0	In each of the Canadian cases, the plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of purchasers, seek from over 13 defendants restitution of the amount allegedly overcharged, general and special damages in the amount of $100 , punitive damages of $10 , pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the investigation and the action.
58492_14_ITEM15_P311_S1	We are not yet required to file our defenses in the Canadian actions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P311_S2	In addition, on July 10, 2012, plaintiff in a class action case (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products) styled Option Consommateurs and Karine Robillard v. Produits Vitafoam Canada Limit e, et.
58492_14_ITEM15_P311_S3	No. 500-6-524-104, filed an amended motion for authorization seeking to add us and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products as defendants in this case.
58492_14_ITEM15_P312_S0	On June 22, 2012, we were also made party to a lawsuit brought in the 16 th Judicial Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, Case Number 1216-CV15179 under the caption Dennis Baker, on Behalf of Himself and all Others Similarly Situated vs. Leggett Platt, Incorporated.
58492_14_ITEM15_P312_S1	The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and/or a class of indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products in the State of Missouri, alleged that we violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act based upon our alleged illegal price inflation of flexible polyurethane foam products.
58492_14_ITEM15_P312_S2	The plaintiff seeks unspecified actual damages, punitive damages and the recovery of reasonable attorney fees.
58492_14_ITEM15_P312_S3	We filed a motion to dismiss this action, which was denied on November 5, 2012.
58492_14_ITEM15_P312_S4	Discovery has commenced and plaintiff has filed a motion for class certification.
58492_14_ITEM15_P312_S5	The parties briefing is completed, and a hearing on the motion was held on February 20, 2014.
58492_14_ITEM15_P313_S0	We deny all of the allegations in all of the above actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_14_ITEM15_P314_S0	These contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_14_ITEM15_P314_S1	Therefore, based on the information available to date, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any, because, at this juncture of the proceedings; discovery is incomplete, all expert liability reports have not been exchanged; and because the litigation involves unsettled legal theories.
58492_14_ITEM15_P315_S0	Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_14_ITEM15_P315_S1	( L P Brazil ) in the amount of $3.1 , under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S1	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 25, 2012 denying the violation.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S2	The Federal Revenue Office, on August 9, 2013, denied L P Brazil's defenses and upheld the assessment at the first administrative level.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S3	L P Brazil was notified about this judgment on October 16, 2013, and has filed an appeal.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S4	On December 17, 2012, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued an additional notice of violation in the amount of $5.5 under MPF Case No. 10855.725260/2012-36 covering the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010 on the same subject matter.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S5	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation on January 17, 2013 denying the violation.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S6	The Brazilian Revenue Office, on June 13, 2013, denied L P Brazil's defenses and upheld the assessment at the first administrative level.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S7	L P Brazil appealed this decision on July 8, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S8	The Brazilian Revenue Office, on December 18, 2013, also issued an audit notice for years 2011 and 2012, which may result in additional assessments.
58492_14_ITEM15_P316_S9	In addition, L P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012, and September 13, 2013 from the Brazilian Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L P Brazil's use of certain tax credits in the years 2006 through 2010.
58492_14_ITEM15_P317_S0	Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings.
58492_14_ITEM15_P317_S1	Combined with prior assessments, L P Brazil has received assessments totaling $1.7 on the same or similar denial of tax credit matters.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S0	L P Brazil is also party to a proceeding involving the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil where the State of Sao Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking $2.4 for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n .04-256.169/2009).
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S1	The State of Sao Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S2	On September 29, 2010, the Court of Tax and Fees of the State of Sao Paulo ruled in favor of L P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S3	The State filed a special appeal and the Special Appeals court remanded the case back to the Court of Tax and Fees for further findings.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S4	On November 9, 2012, the Court of Tax and Fees again ruled in favor of L P Brazil and nullified the tax assessment.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S5	On November 28, 2012, the State filed another special appeal.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S6	The determination to accept the special appeal was made on December 26, 2012, and L P Brazil responded to this special appeal on January 24, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S7	We were also informed on October 4, 2012 that the State of Sao Paulo issued an Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine dated May 29, 2012 under Procedure Number 4.003.484 against L P Brazil in the amount of $2.0 for the tax years 2009 through 2011.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S8	Similar to the prior assessment, the State of Sao Paulo argues that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of Sao Paulo.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S9	On June 21, 2013, the State of Sao Paulo's attorneys converted the Auto-Infringement and Imposition of a Fine No. 4.003.484 to a fiscal execution action against L P Brazil in the amount of $2.6 , under Sorocaba Judicial District Court, Case No. 3005528-50.2013.8.26.0602.
58492_14_ITEM15_P318_S10	L P Brazil filed its response on January 27, 2014 denying the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P319_S0	On December 18, 2012, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil issued a tax assessment to L P Brazil relating to L P Brazil's classifications of innersprings for the collection and payment of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings in Minas Gerais from March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012 in the amount of $.6 , under PTA Case No. 01.000.182756-62.
58492_14_ITEM15_P319_S1	L P Brazil filed its response denying any violation on January 17, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P319_S2	On October 22, 2013, the first administrative level ruled against us but did reduce the tax to $.3 (plus interest and penalties).
58492_14_ITEM15_P319_S3	We appealed to the second administrative level on December 30, 2013, which affirmed the first administrative level ruling.
58492_14_ITEM15_P320_S0	On February 1, 2013, the Brazilian Finance Ministry filed suit against L P Brazil in the Camanducaia Judicial District Court, Case No. 0002222-35.2013.8.13.0878, alleging the untimely payment of $.2 of social contributions (social security and social assistance payments).
58492_14_ITEM15_P320_S1	L P Brazil filed its response on July 11, 2013, denying the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P320_S2	L P Brazil argued the payments were not required to be made because of the application of certain tax credits that were generated by L P Brazil's use of a tariff code for the classification of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings (i.e., the same underlying issue at stake in the other Brazilian matters).
58492_14_ITEM15_P320_S3	L P Brazil posted a bond and filed its response on July 11, 2013, denying the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P320_S4	We deny all of the allegations in these actions.
58492_14_ITEM15_P320_S5	We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_14_ITEM15_P320_S6	However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties.
58492_14_ITEM15_P321_S0	Patent Infringement Claim On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble box springs.
58492_14_ITEM15_P321_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_14_ITEM15_P321_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_14_ITEM15_P321_S3	On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent's validity and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_14_ITEM15_P322_S0	At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P322_S1	The court denied plaintiff's attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.
58492_14_ITEM15_P322_S2	On April 9, 2012 we appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM15_P322_S3	Oral argument was held on February 6, 2013 before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C. On February 14, 2013, the Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 verdict against us, which was fully accrued for in the first quarter of 2013 and then paid in the second quarter of 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P322_S4	We filed a petition for a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision on March 18, 2013, which was denied by the Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM15_P323_S0	The plaintiff requested royalties for post-verdict use of the machines and requested pre-judgment interest in the amount of $.7 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P324_S0	but did award pre-judgment interest of $.5 .
58492_14_ITEM15_P324_S1	On August 2, 2013, both parties filed a notice of appeal of this order to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but plaintiff has since withdrawn its appeal.
58492_14_ITEM15_P325_S0	In 2011, we also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue in the lawsuit the plaintiff brought.
58492_14_ITEM15_P325_S1	The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the key claims of one of three patents.
58492_14_ITEM15_P325_S2	The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second of the patents, but subsequently reversed that decision.
58492_14_ITEM15_P325_S3	With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims.
58492_14_ITEM15_P325_S4	All three of these proceedings were appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM15_P326_S0	Due to a change made to all of the machines, we do not believe that the machines currently use the feature alleged to have infringed the third patent.
58492_14_ITEM15_P327_S0	On April 25, 2013, the plaintiff filed petitions to terminate all re-examination proceedings based on the final ruling of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_14_ITEM15_P327_S1	The Patent Office terminated all three re-examination proceedings, two on December 16, and one on December 18, 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P328_S0	On July 29, 2013, the plaintiff filed a second lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No.
58492_14_ITEM15_P328_S1	CV13-05463 alleging that we and Simmons Bedding Company have continued to infringe the three patents on an automatic stapling machine and the methods used to assemble box springs, and that the plaintiff is entitled to additional damages from January 24, 2012 forward.
58492_14_ITEM15_P328_S2	Leggett and Simmons Bedding Company filed their Answers on November 20, 2013, and intend to vigorously defend the allegations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P329_S0	At this time, we do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations.
58492_14_ITEM15_P330_S0	Amounts for 2012 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reclassification of certain businesses from continuing to discontinued operations in 2013.
58492_14_ITEM15_P331_S0	As discussed in Note R beginning on page 109, in the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a $9 bargain purchase gain related to an acquisition.
58492_14_ITEM15_P332_S0	Net earnings for 2012 include a fourth quarter $27 net tax benefit primarily related to the release of valuation allowances on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by withholding taxes on earnings in China.
58492_14_ITEM15_P333_S0	(1) Uncollectible accounts charged off, net of recoveries.
58492_14_ITEM15_P333_S1	(2) Federal tax effect of state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and credits and changes in currency exchange rates.

58492_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, automobiles and commercial aircraft.
58492_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	As discussed below, our continuing operations are organized into 18 business units, which are divided into 9 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.
58492_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.
58492_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials and machinery, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves.
58492_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.
58492_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our Work Furniture group designs, manufactures, and distributes a wide range of engineered components and products primarily for the office seating market.
58492_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	We believe that the quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire.
58492_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	We have three wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our Steel Tubing business unit also supplies a portion of our internal needs for welded steel tubing.
58492_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.
58492_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	In 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube (Western).
58492_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and formed the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.
58492_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	In 2013, we expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_15_ITEM1_P5_S4	The first was a UK-based business that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_15_ITEM1_P5_S5	The second was a French company that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio.
58492_15_ITEM1_P5_S6	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	We use about two-thirds of our wire output and roughly 15-20% of our steel tubing output to manufacture our own products.
58492_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	For example, we use our wire and steel tubing to make:
58492_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Industrial Materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers, including:
58492_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, manufactures and sells products including automotive seating components, specialized machinery and equipment, and service van interiors.
58492_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our established design capability and focus on product development have made us a leader in innovation.
58492_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	We also benefit from our broad geographic presence and our internal production of key raw materials and components.
58492_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price.
58492_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through a balanced approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2014 we generated TSR of 28% per year on average, which placed us in the top quarter of the S P 500.
58492_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth.
58492_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control.
58492_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	During the past three years, we generated $1.25 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
58492_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR.
58492_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $.31 per share.
58492_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our dividend payout target is 50-60% of earnings; however we have been above that target in recent years.
58492_15_ITEM1_P14_S2	Our dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) was 67%, 88% and 179% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
58492_15_ITEM1_P14_S3	The earnings per share component of the dividend payout ratio was impacted by goodwill impairment charges in 2013 and 2014, and a litigation accrual in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	As our markets continue to recover, we expect to move into our target payout range.
58492_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	In the meantime, we expect to generate enough cash to continue to pay and modestly grow the dividend.
58492_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Company has consistently (for over 25 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	We expect to use cash (after repayment of debt and funding capital expenditures, dividends, and growth opportunities) for share repurchases.
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Share repurchases were significant in 2013 and 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	During those two years, we repurchased a total of 11.4 million shares of our stock and issued 7.1 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans.
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	Consistent with our stated plans to repurchase fewer shares in years when acquisition spending is higher, our share repurchases in 2012 were much lower, given the $188 million we invested to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube.
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	In that year, our outstanding shares increased as we repurchased 2.0 million shares and issued 4.7 million shares through employee programs.
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S5	For the three years combined, we repurchased a total of 13.4 million shares of our stock and issued 11.8 million shares, reducing outstanding shares by 1.1%.
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S6	In 2014, we repurchased 5.4 million shares (at an average of $33.76) and issued 3.9 million shares (at an average of $22.73).
58492_15_ITEM1_P16_S7	Issuances were largely related to employee stock option exercises.
58492_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest).
58492_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), operating cash flows, and return on assets.
58492_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets.
58492_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	Long-term, we aim to achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually.
58492_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity.
58492_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions.
58492_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms: opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.
58492_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our long-term 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_15_ITEM1_P22_S2	We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
58492_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	In 2014, we purchased Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring component production facilities for a purchase price of $44.5 million.
58492_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	In conjunction with this purchase, we also expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy, and boxsprings for Sealy.
58492_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	We also acquired Kintec-Solution, a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components which became part of our Furniture Hardware business for a purchase price of $16.8 million.
58492_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products.
58492_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	In 2013, we expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	The first was a UK-based business acquired for $11.7 million that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	The second was a French company acquired for $14.5 million that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio.
58492_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	In 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million and formed the Aerospace Products business unit.
58492_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	Western produces thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel, stainless steel, and other high strength metals for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	In 2014, we divested the majority of the Store Fixtures group for total consideration of $59 million.
58492_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	We continue to pursue the sale of the remaining portion of the group, which is classified as discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Store Fixtures group was previously part of the Commercial Fixturing Components segment.
58492_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	There were no significant divestitures in 2012 or 2013.
58492_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 77 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The percentages of our external sales in continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	Our international continuing operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico.
58492_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	The products we make in these countries primarily consist of:
58492_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	Shafts for the appliance industry Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for components is growing.
58492_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.
58492_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 81% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	We have continuing operations manufacturing facilities in countries around the world, as shown below.
58492_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	For further information concerning our continuing operations external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States and our tangible long-lived assets outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 87 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The following table shows our approximate percentage of continuing operations external sales by classes of similar products for the last three years:
58492_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel.
58492_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
58492_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials.
58492_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.
58492_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	In 2014, our largest customer accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated continuing operations revenues.
58492_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 27% of these consolidated continuing operations revenues.
58492_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing Components and Specialized Products segments.
58492_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations as of December 31, 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
58492_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.
58492_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	One of our strongest performing product categories across the company is ComfortCore , our fabric-encased spring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses.
58492_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	Many mattress producers have moved to higher valued innersprings like ComfortCore in more of their product lines, typically replacing foam cores or traditional innersprings.
58492_15_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our ComfortCore volume has doubled in just two years, representing 17% of our total U.S. innerspring units in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	We maintain research, development and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and at many of our other facilities.
58492_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	However, we estimate the cost of research and development was $22 million in 2012, $24 million in 2013 and $26 million in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 19,000 employees in continuing operations, of which roughly 13,500 were engaged in production.
58492_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	Of the 19,000, approximately 9,600 were international employees (5,400 in China).
58492_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	Roughly 15% of our employees in continuing operations are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues.
58492_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2015.
58492_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of continuing operations employees by segment.
58492_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 18,800 employees in continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_15_ITEM1_P55_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_15_ITEM1_P55_S4	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_15_ITEM1_P57_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_15_ITEM1_P58_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued.
58492_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	Also, a case brought in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers resulted in a ruling in December 2014, and the implementation of antidumping duties of 106% to 110% and countervailing duties of 178% to 193% on imports of Chinese steel wire rod through December 2019.
58492_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and dispositions, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses.
58492_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have slightly higher sales, while the first and fourth quarters have generally been lower.
58492_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	Segment level seasonality has also been relatively limited, however the Residential Furnishings segment usually has lower sales in the fourth quarter and the Specialized Products segment typically experiences lower sales in the third quarter.
58492_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_15_ITEM1_P63_S1	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of Cash from Operations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 38.
58492_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.
58492_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
58492_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section.
58492_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
58492_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	In addition to these reports, the Company s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section.
58492_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
58492_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	For the periods presented, we classified some of our businesses as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses after the disposal transactions.
58492_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	A substantial portion of our Store Fixtures business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	It has been classified as a discontinued operation.
58492_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	This business designed, produced, installed and managed customers' store fixture projects.
58492_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	It manufactured custom-designed, full store fixture packages for retailers, including shelving, counters, showcases and garment racks.
58492_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	It also produced standard shelving used by large retailers, grocery stores and discount chains.
58492_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	For more information on discontinued operations, see Note B on page 77 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves risk.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	material costs generally move with the market.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed and this would negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Higher raw material costs in past years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If this was to occur again it could negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to contingencies related to certain foam antitrust proceedings that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We previously disclosed that we are a party to a series of civil antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam products.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We have reached a tentative settlement in the U.S. direct purchaser class action cases by agreeing to pay an aggregate pre-tax amount of $39.8 million, inclusive of plaintiff attorneys fees and costs.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We paid $4.0 million of this amount in the fourth quarter of 2014.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We continue to deny all allegations in all of the cases, but have settled the direct purchaser class proceedings (and various other proceedings) to avoid the risk, uncertainty, expense and distraction of litigation.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S5	The settlement is subject to Court approval.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We remain a defendant in other previously disclosed antitrust cases involving the sale of polyurethane foam.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S7	We will vigorously defend ourselves and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S8	However, we have established an incremental accrual for the estimated amount that we believe is necessary to resolve all antitrust matters.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S9	We also believe and expect, based on current facts and circumstances, that any reasonably possible loss incremental to the recorded accruals will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P10_S10	Provided, however, if our assumptions or analysis regarding these contingencies is incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	information regarding our legal contingencies, See Footnote T Contingencies on page 113 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In 2014, 31% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	At December 31, 2014, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $1.02 billion, or 33% of our total assets.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled $687.3 million, or 22% of total assets.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which would negatively impact our earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of, and collections from, our customers, and manage the accounting for, and payment to, our vendors.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flow and earnings.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover and interest rates.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our components and products.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, low consumer confidence, or a depressed housing market could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri.
58492_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We currently have 133 manufacturing locations in continuing operations, of which 84 are located across the United States and 49 are located in 17 foreign countries.
58492_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Manufacturing locations that we own produced approximately 70% of our sales in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_15_ITEM2_P1_S2	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 92 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	In the opinion of management, the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_15_ITEM2_P2_S2	Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_15_ITEM2_P2_S3	However, utilization has increased in many of our businesses with improving market demand, and we are investing to support rapid growth in a few of our businesses, including Automotive, U.S. Spring and Adjustable Bed.
58492_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The information in Note T beginning on page 113 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.
58492_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	Environmental Matter Involving Potential Monetary Sanctions of $100,000 or More On March 27, 2013, Region 5 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a Notice of Violation("NOV") alleging that our subsidiary, Sterling Steel Company, violated the Clean Air Act and the Illinois State Implementation Plan currently in place.
58492_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	Sterling operates a steel rod mill in Sterling, Illinois.
58492_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	The NOV alleges that Sterling, since 2008, has exceeded the allowable annual particulate matter and manganese emission limits for its arc furnace.
58492_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	Sterling requested a conference with the EPA to discuss the alleged violations.
58492_15_ITEM3_P3_S2	The conference was held on May 20, 2013.
58492_15_ITEM3_P4_S0	On July 23, 2013, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation alleging that Sterling violated the opacity limitations of its air permit and Federal and state regulations.
58492_15_ITEM3_P4_S1	A conference to discuss the Finding of Violation occurred in the third quarter of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM3_P4_S2	There have been no material updates with respect to these matters since the third quarter of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM3_P5_S0	Sterling intends to vigorously defend these matters in any enforcement action that may be pursued by the EPA.
58492_15_ITEM3_P5_S1	The EPA did not specify any amount of penalty or injunctive relief being sought in the NOV, Finding of Violation, or in any conference.
58492_15_ITEM3_P5_S2	Any settlement or adverse finding could result in the payment by Sterling of fines, penalties, capital expenditures, or some combination thereof.
58492_15_ITEM3_P5_S3	Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
58492_15_ITEM4_P0_S0	The following information is included in accordance with the provisions of Part III, Item 10 of Form 10-K and Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.

58492_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Price and volume data reflect composite transactions; price range reflects intra-day prices; data source is Bloomberg.
58492_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 13, 2015, we had 8,942 shareholders of record.
58492_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	We expect to continue to pay dividends on our common stock and we are targeting a dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) of 50-60%, though it has been and will likely be higher for the near term.
58492_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	Our dividend payout ratio was 67%, 88% and 179% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.
58492_15_ITEM5_P4_S2	The 2013 and 2014 earnings per share component of the dividend payout ratio was impacted by goodwill impairment charges in both years and a litigation accrual in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM5_P4_S3	See the discussion of the Company s targeted dividend payout ratio under Pay Dividends in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 42.
58492_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	During 2012, the Company declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five of them, given its decision to accelerate the first quarter 2013 dividend payment into December 2012 in anticipation of tax rate increases on individual taxpayers.
58492_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	For 2013, the Company returned to its typical practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in January 2014.
58492_15_ITEM5_P5_S2	The five dividend payments in 2012 utilized approximately $200 million of cash while the three payments in 2013 utilized roughly $125 million of cash.
58492_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	The table below is a listing of our purchases of the Company s common stock during each calendar month of the fourth quarter of 2014.
58492_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	(1) This number includes 268,036 shares which were not repurchased as part of a publicly announced plan or program, all of which were shares surrendered in transactions permitted under the Company s benefit plans.
58492_15_ITEM5_P7_S1	It does not include shares withheld for taxes on option exercises and stock unit conversions.
58492_15_ITEM5_P7_S2	(2) On August 4, 2004, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year beginning January 1, 2005.
58492_15_ITEM5_P7_S3	This standing authorization was first reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, filed August 5, 2004, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors.
58492_15_ITEM5_P7_S4	As such, effective January 1, 2015, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2015.
58492_15_ITEM5_P7_S5	No specific repurchase schedule has been established.
58492_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	______________________________ Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2014 includes $54 million (pretax) associated with litigation accruals.
58492_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	Discontinued Operations includes the following pretax items: $108 million of goodwill impairment, a $9 million loss on the sale of the majority of our Store Fixtures unit, and $35 million associated with litigation accruals.
58492_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2013 include pretax charges of $67 million related to the Commercial Vehicle Products group ($63 million goodwill impairment charge and $4 million accelerated amortization of a customer-related intangible asset), and a $9 million bargain purchase gain related to an acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2012 include a $27 million net tax benefit primarily related to the release of valuation allowances on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by deferred withholding taxes on earnings in China.
58492_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company incurred pretax asset impairment and restructuring-related charges totaling $44 million in 2011.
58492_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	Of these charges, $20 million were associated with continuing operations and $24 million were related to discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	Sales from continuing operations grew significantly in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Same location sales improved 6% reflecting strong volume gains in Automotive and most of our Residential Furnishings businesses.
58492_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Acquisitions also contributed 3% to sales growth.
58492_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased (versus 2013) reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales and non-recurrence of prior year goodwill impairment and other charges related to the Commercial Vehicle Products business, partially offset by higher foam litigation accruals in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	A major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses, by increasing investments in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive.
58492_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	In 2014, we made good progress on both fronts.
58492_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	In July, we acquired Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities.
58492_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	During the year, we also expanded our operations in China to support rapid growth of our Automotive business and invested in machinery to support the significant growth of ComfortCore innersprings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	Additionally, in late 2014, we completed the divestiture of the majority of our Store Fixtures business.
58492_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Operating cash for the full year was strong.
58492_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	We again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 25 years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	2014 marked the 43rd consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period.
58492_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Only one other S P 500 company can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	We ended 2014 with net debt to net capital comfortably within our long-standing targeted range.
58492_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	In November we issued $300 million of notes and repaid $180 million of notes that matured.
58492_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	We ended the year with all of our $600 million commercial paper program and revolver facility available.
58492_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	We target TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long term.
58492_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	For the three years ended December 31, 2014, we generated TSR of 28% per year on average.
58492_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	That placed us in the top quarter of the S P 500, exceeding our top one-third goal.
58492_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price].
58492_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	We seek to achieve TSR in the top one-third of the S P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S P 500) on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2014, we generated TSR of 28% per year on average.
58492_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	That performance placed us in the top quarter of the S P 500 companies, exceeding our top one-third goal.
58492_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 7% of our sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized.
58492_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	They include most producers of residential furniture and bedding, auto and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.
58492_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	We continue to retain more production capacity than we currently utilize, and with our meaningful operating leverage, earnings should further benefit as market demand continues to improve.
58492_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	For each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing this spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod.
58492_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	This is a benefit that our competitors do not have.
58492_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline.
58492_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	As we begin 2015, market prices for steel scrap in the U.S. are decreasing.
58492_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	This is leading to downward pricing pressure on steel rod and other types of steel materials.
58492_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	We expect, in certain cases, to pass the lower costs through to our customers.
58492_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	However, our margins could experience some short-term pressure if steel deflation causes us to reduce our selling prices before we consume our higher cost inventories.
58492_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile during certain periods in recent years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	In late 2013 and early 2014, metal margins decreased significantly as market conditions did not allow full recovery of higher scrap costs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the implementation of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod.
58492_15_ITEM7_P18_S4	The antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%.
58492_15_ITEM7_P18_S5	Both remain in effect through December 2019.
58492_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	We must continue to find ways to assist our customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Many of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.
58492_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued.
58492_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We previously disclosed that we are a defendant in a series of civil antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	We have reached a tentative settlement in the U.S. direct purchaser class action cases by agreeing to pay an aggregate amount of $39.8 million, inclusive of plaintiff attorneys fees and costs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	We continue to deny all allegations in all of the cases, but have settled the direct purchaser class cases to avoid the risk, uncertainty, expense and distraction of litigation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	The settlement is subject to Court approval.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we paid $4 million to the Court related to the settlement.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	A final fairness hearing was held on February 3, 2015, but we have not yet received a ruling.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S6	We recorded a $39.8 million (pre-tax) accrual for this tentative settlement in the third quarter of 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P26_S7	Since the payment is partially attributable to our former Prime Foam Products business, which was sold in 2007, $8.3 million of the charge was reflected in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Although we deny liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we recorded an additional aggregate litigation accrual in continuing operations of $22 million (pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2014, which represents our reasonable estimate of unrecorded probable loss for all pending and threatened litigation proceedings impacting continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We also recorded an additional $27 million (pre-tax) litigation contingency accrual in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter based upon the same facts, circumstances and analysis.
58492_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	By far the largest portion of these accruals relates to the foam antitrust litigation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	We believe, based on current facts, that these accruals are adequate to resolve all pending antitrust matters.
58492_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	We expect to incur the majority of the resulting cash payments in 2015, with the remainder expected to be paid in 2016.
58492_15_ITEM7_P27_S5	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current facts and circumstances, that additional legal contingency losses (other than those quantified and disclosed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 113) are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Some of our prior businesses, including the Store Fixtures business, are disclosed in our financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses after the disposal transactions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Store Fixtures business was previously reported as part of the Commercial Fixturing Components segment.
58492_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	These operations manufacture and distribute custom-designed, complete store fixture packages for major retailers, including metal and wood shelving, counters, and showcases.
58492_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	For more information on discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77.
58492_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June of each year, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	We performed our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, and on July 14, 2014, concluded that an impairment charge of $108 million ($93 million after tax) was required for our Store Fixtures group.
58492_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	This non-cash impairment charge reflects the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures group and was recognized in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The Store Fixtures group was dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Because of the seasonal nature of the fixture and display industry (where revenue and profitability were typically expected to increase in the second and third quarters assuming the normal historical pattern of heavy shipments during those months) we reasonably anticipated being awarded significant customer orders in the second quarter of 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	However, as the second quarter progressed, anticipated orders did not materialize and the Store Fixtures business deteriorated, with declines most pronounced in May and June.
58492_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	Taking these developments into account, we lowered our projection of future margins and growth rates (the 10-year compound growth rate for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes plus Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) was reduced to .5% from 4.8% in the prior year's review) and increased the discount rate to 12% from 10.5%, causing fair value to fall below carrying value.
58492_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The lower expectations of future revenue and profitability were due to reduced overall market demand for shelving, counters, showcases and garment racks as many retailers are reducing their investments in traditional store space and focusing more on e-commerce initiatives.
58492_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	As indicated in the second quarter 10-Q, we engaged an investment banker to assist with the sale of the Store Fixtures group.
58492_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	On November 1, 2014, we sold the majority of the Store Fixtures business for $59 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	These divested operations represented approximately three-quarters of the business unit's revenues.
58492_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $5 million, which was recognized in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	We continue to pursue the sale of the two remaining Store Fixtures facilities and do not expect a significant cash impact from these exit activities.
58492_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	Because of the recent divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business (formerly in the Commercial Fixturing Components segment) along with the pending retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting will change during the first quarter of 2015.
58492_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	As a result, the composition of our four segments will also change to reflect the new structure beginning in the first quarter 2015.
58492_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Sales from continuing operations grew 9% in 2014 from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Earnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, largely due to sales growth.
58492_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	Other items in 2013 and 2014 essentially offset.
58492_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2014, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	Same location sales (from continuing operations) grew 6%, reflecting strong volume gains in Automotive and in most of the company's Residential Furnishings businesses.
58492_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	These improvements were partially offset by weak demand in Commercial Vehicle Products.
58492_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	Sales growth in 2014 also benefited from the acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities and other smaller acquisitions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	In conjunction with the purchase of the facilities from Tempur Sealy, we expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy and boxsprings for Sealy.
58492_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, with several items contributing to the year-over-year comparison.
58492_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	Operationally, earnings growth resulted primarily from higher sales, however this benefit was partially offset by higher stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett Platt share price versus the market in late 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	Reduced metal margins in our steel rod and wire operations and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in the year also offset some of the earnings benefit from higher sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	As indicated in the table above, a few additional items impacted the year-over-year earnings comparison.
58492_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	In 2013, earnings from continuing operations reflected non-cash impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and an acquisition-related bargain purchase gain.
58492_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Earnings from continuing operations in 2014 were negatively impacted by litigation accruals, which primarily related to the foam antitrust cases discussed on page 28.
58492_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	Steel inflation in late 2013 resulted in full-year LIFO expense of $4 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P44_S4	In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74.
58492_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Net interest expense in 2014 decreased slightly versus 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our 2014 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 24%, compared to 22% for 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The 2014 tax rate benefited from $14 million of favorable adjustments, including additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	The 2013 tax rate includes $17 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state tax audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	In the following section we discuss 2014 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) from continuing operations for each of our segments.
58492_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77.
58492_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 13% in 2014, from unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions (including the purchase of the three Tempur Sealy innerspring production facilities).
58492_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	Volume grew in Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Home Furniture, Geo Components, Fabric Converting, and Carpet Underlay, from a combination of market share gains and broadly improving market demand in the second half of the year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	Within our U.S. Spring business, we experienced significant growth in ComfortCore (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 52%.
58492_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	Mattress producers continue to integrate these higher-valued innersprings into more of their product lines, in many cases replacing lower-valued innersprings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	Demand was also extremely strong in our Adjustable Bed business, with unit volume increasing 56% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume increased 10% as consumer demand for reclining chairs and sofas continues to grow.
58492_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales more than offset by a $54 million accrual related to the foam litigation discussed on page 28, and higher stock compensation expense.
58492_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Sales in Commercial Fixturing Components increased 7% in 2014 due to market share gains and improved market demand in our Work Furniture business.
58492_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins improved slightly in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales partially offset by operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture.
58492_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Sales in the segment increased 3% in 2014, primarily from aerospace acquisitions completed in the prior year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Same location sales were down slightly from a combination of reduced trade sales from our rod mill and lower wire volume.
58492_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins declined versus 2013, primarily due to reduced metal margin in our steel rod and wire operations, and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 9% in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth, with sales up 17% from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and demand strength in each of the major markets.
58492_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	Partially offsetting this growth, CVP sales declined 21%, reflecting delayed vehicle replacement by major fleet operators and a change in an OEM incentive program.
58492_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Machinery sales increased modestly for the year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased due to higher sales and the non-recurrence of impairment and other charges (of $67 million) related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business that were recognized in 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to a loss of $124 million in 2014 (versus earnings of $13 million in 2013).
58492_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	This significant decline is primarily due to an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 28, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 28.
58492_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	Weak capital spending by retailers in 2014 led to lower volume in the Store Fixtures business, and also contributed to reduced earnings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P58_S3	The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P58_S4	Earnings in 2013 reflected an $8 million tax benefit attributable to another small operation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Sales from continuing operations grew modestly in 2013 from a combination of slightly higher unit volume and acquisitions, partially offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill (sales shifted from trade to intra-segment).
58492_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	Earnings from continuing operations decreased in 2013 (versus 2012) as a result of impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and the non-recurrence of a significant tax benefit from 2012.
58492_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Reported amounts for 2012 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect only continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2013, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Same location sales (from continuing operations) grew slightly, with 2% unit volume growth partially offset by a 1% revenue decline from lower trade sales at our rod mill.
58492_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	Sales grew primarily from market strength and new program awards in Automotive and raw material-related price increases in Carpet Underlay.
58492_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	These improvements were partially offset by declines in CVP and Adjustable Bed.
58492_15_ITEM7_P64_S3	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during 2013 was offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, and the rod mill continued to operate at full capacity.
58492_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Earnings from continuing operations decreased as a result of non-cash impairment and other charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and the non-recurrence of a significant tax benefit from 2012.
58492_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Operationally, the earnings benefit from modest unit volume growth and acquisitions was largely offset by an increase in steel costs late in the year that resulted in higher LIFO expense.
58492_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	The other items detailed in the table above also contributed to the change in earnings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	2013 earnings from continuing operations also benefited $8 million ($5 million after tax) from gains on asset sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	These gains are primarily comprised of a $3 million gain related to a hurricane insurance claim, and $3 million for several different properties associated with the closing of various operations in prior years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_15_ITEM7_P67_S3	In 2012, lower commodity costs led to a LIFO benefit of $13 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P67_S4	Steel inflation in late 2013 resulted in a significant change in our full-year LIFO estimates (interim expectations for a full-year LIFO benefit of $12 million changed instead to a full year expense of $4 million as steel costs increased late in the year) and a concentration of LIFO expense in the fourth quarter.
58492_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74.
58492_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Net interest expense in 2013 was flat with 2012.
58492_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The 2013 worldwide effective income tax rate on our continuing operations was 22%, compared to 19% for 2012.
58492_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	In both years the tax rate reflects necessary tax reserve reductions and other tax benefits that lowered the overall rate.
58492_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	The 2013 tax rate includes $17 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state tax audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_15_ITEM7_P70_S3	The impact of these items on the tax rate was magnified by our fourth quarter CVP impairment.
58492_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	In 2012, the tax rate benefited from the release of a $38 million valuation allowance on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by the accrual of $11 million of China withholding taxes.
58492_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	In the following section we discuss 2013 sales and EBIT from continuing operations for each of our segments.
58492_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Reported amounts for 2012 have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect only continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77.
58492_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 3% in 2013 from unit volume growth in certain product categories and raw material-related price increases in Carpet Underlay.
58492_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Volume grew primarily in European spring, seating components, sofa sleepers, and carpet underlay.
58492_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	These gains were partially offset by lower adjustable bed volume.
58492_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	Within our U.S. Spring business, we experienced unit volume growth in boxsprings and ComfortCore (which is our pocketed coil innerspring), however total domestic innerspring units decreased modestly.
58492_15_ITEM7_P75_S4	Furniture hardware unit volume also decreased for the full year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins increased in 2013, primarily due to higher sales, cost improvements, and favorable product mix in U.S. Spring.
58492_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Sales in Commercial Fixturing Components decreased 2% in 2013 due to lower demand in the office seating market which negatively impacted our Work Furniture business.
58492_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins decreased in 2013, primarily from lower sales, unfavorable product mix, and weak performance by our Chinese joint venture operation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Sales in the segment decreased 3% in 2013, with revenue from acquisitions more than offset by lower trade sales from our rod mill and steel-related price deflation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The decrease in trade sales of steel rod during the year was more than offset by an increase in intra-segment rod sales, and the rod mill continued to operate at full capacity.
58492_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	A change in the mix of rod sales from trade to intra-segment is generally positive to earnings since that change tends to also shift the production mix to higher-value high carbon rods.
58492_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	EBIT and EBIT margins improved versus 2012, primarily due to the absence of acquisition-related costs at Western Pneumatic Tube and earnings from acquisitions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	These gains were partially offset by lower metal margins in steel rod in the second half of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	We expanded our Aerospace Products business unit in 2013 with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	The first was a U.K.-based business acquired in May that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	We recorded $6 million of goodwill related to this acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	The second was a French company acquired in July that added small diameter, high pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio.
58492_15_ITEM7_P81_S4	This business was acquired at a price less than fair value of the net identifiable assets, and we recorded a $9 million non-taxable bargain purchase gain (reflected in the "Intersegment eliminations and other" line of the table above).
58492_15_ITEM7_P81_S5	The Aerospace Products business unit, which now has annual revenues in excess of $120 million, continues to perform very well and earnings should further benefit as we fully integrate these acquisitions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2013, with growth in Automotive partially offset by a decline in Commercial Vehicle Products.
58492_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth from a combination of factors, including market strength in North America and Asia, participation in additional vehicle platforms, and expanded component content (via upgraded features).
58492_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	EBIT decreased $60 million in 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	We recognized impairment and other charges (of $67 million) related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business, and this was partially offset by the positive impact from higher sales.
58492_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	We continue to assess strategic alternatives for our CVP group, including possible divestiture of the business.
58492_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Late in 2013, performance of the business deteriorated.
58492_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	As a result, it became apparent that current market values for certain CVP assets had fallen below recorded book values, and impairment charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets were recognized.
58492_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	This decline in current market values of the assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and profitability, reflecting reduced market demand for the racks, shelving, and cabinets used in telecom, cable, and delivery vans.
58492_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to $13 million in 2013 from $19 million in 2012.
58492_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Weak capital spending by retailers in 2013 led to lower volume in the Store Fixtures business, and contributed to lower earnings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	Earnings in 2013 and 2012 also reflected $8 million and $6 million of tax benefits, respectively, attributable to a small operation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P86_S3	In addition, 2012 included a $2 million gain from a litigation settlement associated with a previously divested business.
58492_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Our operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	Cash from operations was once again strong in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	For over 25 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments.
58492_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	We expect this to again be the case in 2015.
58492_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Capital expenditures increased in 2014, driven in part by investments to support strong growth in Automotive and U.S. Spring.
58492_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	We also completed five acquisitions, the largest of which included the three Tempur Sealy innerspring facilities, and bought back 5.4 million shares of our stock during the year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	We ended 2014 with net debt to net capital at 31.5%, within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%.
58492_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 44.
58492_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	In November 2014, we issued $300 million of 3.8% notes and repaid $180 million of 4.65% notes that matured.
58492_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	We ended the year with all of our $600 million commercial paper program available.
58492_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Cash from operations decreased in 2014 from a combination of factors.
58492_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	Net earnings declined primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge (which was a non-cash item) and increased litigation accruals.
58492_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	This decrease in earnings was partially offset by a net reduction in working capital that resulted from the increased litigation accruals (a significant portion of which was not paid in 2014), partially offset by higher accounts receivable associated with increased sales volume late in the year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	We continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended 2014 with adjusted working capital at 7.9% of annualized sales from continuing operations 1 .
58492_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	The table below shows this non-GAAP calculation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our performance related to operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement.
58492_15_ITEM7_P94_S1	We also exclude working capital associated with discontinued operations to monitor operating performance of our ongoing businesses.
58492_15_ITEM7_P94_S2	The decrease in adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales reflects increased litigation accruals in late 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Annualized sales from continuing operations equal 4th quarter sales from continuing operations ($953 million in 2014 and $859 million in 2013) multiplied by 4.
58492_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.
58492_15_ITEM7_P96_S0	The following table presents dollar amounts of key working capital components at the end of the past two years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P97_S0	Trade Receivables increased in 2014 from a combination of strong sales late in the year and acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of Store Fixtures.
58492_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	Inventory decreased in 2014, as increases driven by sales growth and acquisitions were more than offset by the divestiture of Store Fixtures.
58492_15_ITEM7_P99_S0	Accounts Payable also increased primarily due to the timing of raw material purchases, more favorable payment terms with vendors, and acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of Store Fixtures.
58492_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	The next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).
58492_15_ITEM7_P100_S1	These amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect only continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P101_S0	The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_15_ITEM7_P101_S1	The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables (quarterly net sales number of days in the quarter).
58492_15_ITEM7_P101_S2	The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_15_ITEM7_P102_S0	Changes in the quarterly Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) reflect normal seasonal fluctuations due to the timing of cash collection and other factors.
58492_15_ITEM7_P102_S1	Changes in the DSO reflected in the table above are consistent with our historical range, and are not indicative of changes in payment trends or credit-worthiness of customers.
58492_15_ITEM7_P102_S2	We experienced a slight increase in DSO during 2014 related to growth in businesses that typically have longer payment terms.
58492_15_ITEM7_P102_S3	However, over the last few years our DSO has generally decreased as a result of improved payment patterns of several large customers and other programs with incentives for early payment offered in conjunction with third parties.
58492_15_ITEM7_P102_S4	Payment trends by major customers remained stable in 2014, with slight improvements in full-year bad debt expense compared to 2013 levels.
58492_15_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our Days Inventory on Hand (DIO) typically fluctuates within a reasonably narrow range as a result of differences in the timing of sales, production levels, and inventory purchases.
58492_15_ITEM7_P103_S1	Expense associated with slow moving and obsolete inventories in 2014 was generally in line with that of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P104_S0	We actively strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors, and we have also implemented various programs with our vendors and third parties that allow flexible payment options.
58492_15_ITEM7_P104_S1	As a result of these activities, we have increased our Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) by more than ten days over the past several years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P104_S2	We continue to optimize accounts payable levels, but the rate of incremental improvement has slowed.
58492_15_ITEM7_P105_S0	Cash is readily available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).
58492_15_ITEM7_P106_S0	Capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain, modernize, and expand manufacturing capacity.
58492_15_ITEM7_P106_S1	We also invest to support new product introductions and specific product categories that are rapidly growing.
58492_15_ITEM7_P106_S2	The increase in capital expenditures during 2014 primarily related to continued global growth in Automotive, capacity additions to support growth of ComfortCore innersprings (fabric encased coils), and process and quality improvements at our steel rod mill.
58492_15_ITEM7_P106_S3	In 2015, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $120 million as we continue to support growth and opportunities in these businesses.
58492_15_ITEM7_P106_S4	Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital.
58492_15_ITEM7_P106_S5	This emphasis heightens the focus on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.
58492_15_ITEM7_P107_S0	Our strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P107_S1	We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our Grow businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_15_ITEM7_P107_S2	In January 2012, we purchased Western Pneumatic Tube for $188 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P107_S3	This acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.
58492_15_ITEM7_P107_S4	Western established for us a strong competitive position in the higher return, higher growth aerospace market.
58492_15_ITEM7_P107_S5	In 2013, we acquired two smaller, complementary businesses in this aerospace tubing platform.
58492_15_ITEM7_P108_S0	On July 1, 2014, we purchased the three Tempur Sealy U.S. innerspring component production facilities for $45 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P108_S1	This additional volume should enhance our economies of scale, benefit from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire, and allow manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base.
58492_15_ITEM7_P108_S2	In 2014, we also acquired Kintec-Solution, a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for residential furniture.
58492_15_ITEM7_P109_S0	Additional details about these and other smaller acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109.
58492_15_ITEM7_P110_S0	Dividends are one of the primary means by which we return cash to shareholders.
58492_15_ITEM7_P110_S1	During 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of tax rate increases on individual taxpayers.
58492_15_ITEM7_P110_S2	The chart above reflects that accelerated dividend payment.
58492_15_ITEM7_P110_S3	In 2013, we returned to our prior practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in January 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P110_S4	Therefore, the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 was lower, at $125 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P111_S0	Maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_15_ITEM7_P111_S1	In 2014, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.31 per share and extended to 43 years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases, at an average compound growth rate of 13%.
58492_15_ITEM7_P111_S2	Our targeted dividend payout ratio is approximately 50-60% of net earnings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P111_S3	The actual payout ratio has been higher in recent years, but as earnings grow, we expect to move into that target range.
58492_15_ITEM7_P112_S0	Stock repurchases are the other means by which we return cash to shareholders.
58492_15_ITEM7_P112_S1	As shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in 2013 and 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P112_S2	During those two years, we repurchased a total of 11.4 million shares of our stock and issued 7.1 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans.
58492_15_ITEM7_P112_S3	Consistent with our stated plans to repurchase fewer shares in years when acquisition spending is higher, our share repurchases in 2012 were much lower, given the $188 million we invested to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube.
58492_15_ITEM7_P113_S0	outstanding shares increased as we repurchased 2.0 million shares and issued 4.7 million shares through employee programs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P113_S1	For the three years combined, we repurchased a total of 13.4 million shares of our stock and issued 11.8 million shares, reducing outstanding shares by 1.1%.
58492_15_ITEM7_P113_S2	In 2014, we repurchased 5.4 million shares (at an average of $33.76) and issued 3.9 million shares (at an average of $22.73).
58492_15_ITEM7_P113_S3	Issuances were largely related to employee stock option exercises.
58492_15_ITEM7_P114_S0	Consistent with our stated priorities, we expect to use remaining operating cash (after funding capital expenditures, dividends, and acquisitions) to prudently buy back our stock, subject to the outlook for the economy, our level of cash generation, and potential opportunities to strategically grow the company.
58492_15_ITEM7_P114_S1	We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.
58492_15_ITEM7_P115_S0	This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P116_S0	___________________________________________ (1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_15_ITEM7_P116_S1	The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps.
58492_15_ITEM7_P117_S0	(2) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_15_ITEM7_P118_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_15_ITEM7_P119_S0	The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2014 and 2013, calculated in two ways:
58492_15_ITEM7_P120_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_15_ITEM7_P121_S0	Long-term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_15_ITEM7_P122_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_15_ITEM7_P122_S1	We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.
58492_15_ITEM7_P123_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $99 million in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	In November, we issued $300 million aggregate principal of 10-year notes at a rate of 3.8% per year, and repaid $180 million of 4.65% notes that matured.
58492_15_ITEM7_P123_S2	We also repaid outstanding commercial paper.
58492_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	In 2013, we repaid $200 million of 4.7% notes that matured.
58492_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	We funded the payoff with a combination of cash and commercial paper.
58492_15_ITEM7_P125_S0	In August 2012, we issued $300 million of 10-year notes at a rate of 3.4% per year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P125_S1	As a part of this issuance, we also settled forward starting interest swaps and recognized a loss that will be amortized over the life of the notes.
58492_15_ITEM7_P125_S2	The fully weighted effective interest rate associated with these notes is 5.0%.
58492_15_ITEM7_P126_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 12 lenders.
58492_15_ITEM7_P126_S1	The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P126_S2	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_15_ITEM7_P126_S3	Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_15_ITEM7_P127_S0	The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2014 was $156 million and $300 million, respectively.
58492_15_ITEM7_P127_S1	During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $61 million and $167 million respectively.
58492_15_ITEM7_P127_S2	At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $69 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.
58492_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	In August 2015, we have $200 million of 5.0% notes that mature.
58492_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	With operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.
58492_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	At December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $333 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_15_ITEM7_P130_S0	A substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost.
58492_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	However, due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $89 million of this cash is currently inaccessible for repatriation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P130_S3	Additionally, if we had to bring all of the foreign cash back immediately in the form of dividends, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to approximately $82 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P130_S4	In 2014, 2013, and 2012, we brought back $129 million, $119 million, and $50 million (respectively) of cash, in each case at little to no added tax cost.
58492_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2014:
58492_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_15_ITEM7_P133_S0	Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_15_ITEM7_P134_S0	Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2014 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P134_S1	Other obligations include our net reserves for tax contingencies in the "More Than 5 Years" column because these obligations are long-term in nature and actual payment dates can not be specifically determined.
58492_15_ITEM7_P134_S2	Other obligations also include our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension plans.
58492_15_ITEM7_P135_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_15_ITEM7_P135_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_15_ITEM7_P135_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_15_ITEM7_P135_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_15_ITEM7_P136_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_15_ITEM7_P137_S0	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM7_P137_S1	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM7_P138_S0	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74.
58492_15_ITEM7_P139_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_15_ITEM7_P140_S0	In July 2014, we concluded that an impairment was required related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures group, which was formerly part of the Commercial Fixturing Components segment and is now reported in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P140_S1	A non-cash charge of $108 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 for the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business.
58492_15_ITEM7_P141_S0	In December 2013, we concluded that an impairment was required relating to the goodwill of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) group.
58492_15_ITEM7_P141_S1	A non-cash charge of $63 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_15_ITEM7_P143_S1	Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	The remaining goodwill associated with the CVP reporting unit is $13 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P146_S1	A further decline in the long-term outlook for the business could result in future impairments.
58492_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	At December 31, 2014, all reporting units have fair values that exceed carrying value by more than 40%, and have goodwill of $819 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P147_S1	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	Impairments were $1 million in 2014, and $2 million in 2013 and 2012.
58492_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product.
58492_15_ITEM7_P155_S1	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e. not selling very quickly).
58492_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving.
58492_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	At December 31, 2014, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $30 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories).
58492_15_ITEM7_P159_S1	This is consistent with the December 31, 2013 and 2012 reserves of $36 million in each year, representing 6% of FIFO inventories.
58492_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	Additions to inventory reserves in 2014 were $10 million, which were comparable to the previous year.
58492_15_ITEM7_P160_S1	We do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels.
58492_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay (since we are self-insured).
58492_15_ITEM7_P162_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $9 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P163_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P163_S2	At December 31, 2014, we had accrued $36 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	Internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years and are expected to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future.
58492_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_15_ITEM7_P168_S1	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	The average annual amount of customer-related bad debt expense was $5 million (less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P170_S1	At December 31, 2014, our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled $17 million (about 3% of our accounts and customer-related notes receivable of $488 million).
58492_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	We have not experienced any significant individual customer bankruptcies in the past three years.
58492_15_ITEM7_P171_S1	We believe the financial health of our major customers has modestly improved, but some are highly leveraged, and this could cause circumstances to change in the future.
58492_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	At December 31, 2014, we had $4 million of non-customer notes receivable, primarily related to divested businesses, and have recorded reserves of less than $1 million for these notes.
58492_15_ITEM7_P172_S1	Most of these notes are to be paid by highly leveraged entities, which could result in the need for additional reserves in the future.
58492_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid, which also impacts current year pension expense.
58492_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	Determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities).
58492_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	Other assumptions include rates of compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates, and retirement ages.
58492_15_ITEM7_P175_S2	These estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	The discount rates used to calculate the pension liability for our most significant plans decreased approximately 80 basis points in 2014 due to lower corporate bond yields.
58492_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.6 million and increases the plans benefit obligation by $12 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P176_S2	The expected return on assets was 6.7% in 2014, and 6.6% in 2013 and 2012.
58492_15_ITEM7_P176_S3	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.6 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_15_ITEM7_P178_S0	Mortality assumptions represent our best estimate of the duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date.
58492_15_ITEM7_P178_S1	These estimates are based on each plans' demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances.
58492_15_ITEM7_P178_S2	Longer life expectancies increased our pension liability for our most significant plans by approximately $20 million in 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred, we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss.
58492_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_15_ITEM7_P180_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable.
58492_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described beginning on page 53.
58492_15_ITEM7_P181_S1	In the four years prior to 2014, the largest annual cost for litigation claims was $6 million (excluding legal fees).
58492_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	We recorded expense during 2014 for various proceedings and other claims.
58492_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	By far the largest portion of these accruals was associated with a group of antitrust lawsuits related to alleged price fixing of prime foam and carpet underlay products as discussed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 113.
58492_15_ITEM7_P183_S1	In August 2014, we reached a tentative settlement in the U.S. direct purchaser class action cases by agreeing to pay an aggregate amount of $39.8 million, inclusive of attorneys' fees and costs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P183_S2	Because this accrual is partially attributable to our former Prime Foam Products business sold in 2007, $8.3 million is reflected in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	In addition to the above, we recorded litigation accruals in continuing operations of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 which represents our reasonable estimate of unrecorded probable loss for all pending and threatened litigation proceedings impacting continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P184_S1	We also recorded an additional $27 million litigation contingency accrual in discontinued operations during the fourth quarter.
58492_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_15_ITEM7_P185_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM7_P185_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_15_ITEM7_P185_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P185_S4	If necessary, we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_15_ITEM7_P186_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_15_ITEM7_P187_S0	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_15_ITEM7_P187_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $34 million and $45 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to net operating losses and other tax carryforwards.
58492_15_ITEM7_P187_S2	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_15_ITEM7_P187_S3	Valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a 50% probability of being realized.
58492_15_ITEM7_P188_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_15_ITEM7_P188_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P189_S0	Potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P189_S1	If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed at current rates, we would incur additional taxes of approximately $82 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P190_S0	Audits by various taxing authorities continue as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_15_ITEM7_P190_S1	Based upon past audit experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_15_ITEM7_P191_S0	The likelihood of recovery of net operating losses and other tax carryforwards has been closely evaluated and is based upon such factors as the time remaining before expiration, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P191_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_15_ITEM7_P191_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_15_ITEM7_P191_S3	Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S0	We are a party to various proceedings and matters involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S1	When it is probable, in management s judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings other than as indicated below.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S3	We deny all allegations in all pending antitrust proceedings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S4	We will vigorously defend ourselves in all proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S5	However, we have established an accrual for the estimated amount that we believe is necessary to resolve all antitrust matters.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S6	We also believe and expect, based on current facts and circumstances, that any reasonably possible losses incremental to the recorded accrual will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM7_P192_S7	For specific information regarding accruals please see Accrual for Loss Contingencies below.
58492_15_ITEM7_P193_S0	Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against several defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_15_ITEM7_P193_S1	U.S. Direct Purchaser Class Action Cases.
58492_15_ITEM7_P193_S2	We were named as a defendant in three pending direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products.
58492_15_ITEM7_P193_S3	The direct purchaser class action cases were all filed in or were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_15_ITEM7_P194_S0	The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of direct purchasers, seek three times the amount of damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_15_ITEM7_P194_S1	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P195_S0	We filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim, which were denied by the Ohio Court.
58492_15_ITEM7_P195_S1	A motion for class certification was filed on behalf of the direct purchasers.
58492_15_ITEM7_P195_S2	A hearing on the motion was held and the Court certified the direct purchaser class.
58492_15_ITEM7_P195_S3	We filed a Petition for Permission to Appeal from Class Certification Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which was denied.
58492_15_ITEM7_P196_S0	The Court ordered all parties to attend non-binding mediation with a mediator of their choosing.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S0	Tentative Settlement of U.S. Direct Purchaser Class Action Cases.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S1	We reached a tentative settlement in the U.S. direct purchaser class action cases on August 14, 2014, by agreeing to pay an aggregate amount of $39.8 million, inclusive of plaintiff attorneys' fees and costs.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S2	We continue to deny all allegations in the cases, but settled the direct purchaser class cases to avoid the risk, uncertainty, expense and distraction of litigation.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S3	The settlement is subject to Court approval.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S4	We recorded a $39.8 million (pre-tax) accrual for the settlement in the third quarter 2014.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S5	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we paid $4 million to the Court related to the tentative settlement.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S6	Since the accrual is partially attributable to our former Prime Foam Products business, which was sold in the first quarter of 2007, $8.3 million of expense is reflected in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S7	The deadline for direct purchasers to exclude themselves from the litigation and settlement classes was January 26, 2015.
58492_15_ITEM7_P197_S8	A final fairness hearing was held on February 3, 2015, but we have not yet received a ruling.
58492_15_ITEM7_P198_S0	U.S. Indirect Purchaser Class Action Cases.

58492_15_ITEM7_P226_S2	We appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_15_ITEM7_P227_S0	Oral argument was held before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C.
58492_15_ITEM7_P227_S1	The Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 million verdict against us, which was fully accrued for in the first quarter of 2013 and then paid in the second quarter of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7_P227_S2	We filed a petition for a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision which was denied.
58492_15_ITEM7_P228_S0	The plaintiff requested royalties for post-verdict use of the machines, and requested pre-judgment interest in the amount of $.7 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P228_S1	The District Court ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to additional ongoing royalties for our continued use of the machines, but did award pre-judgment interest of $.5 million.
58492_15_ITEM7_P228_S2	Both parties filed a notice of appeal of this order to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but plaintiff has since withdrawn its appeal.
58492_15_ITEM7_P228_S3	We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue in the lawsuit the plaintiff brought.

58492_15_ITEM7_P228_S5	The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second of the patents, but subsequently reversed that decision.
58492_15_ITEM7_P228_S6	With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims.
58492_15_ITEM7_P228_S7	All three of these proceedings were appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals.
58492_15_ITEM7_P229_S0	The plaintiff filed petitions to terminate all re-examination proceedings based on the final ruling of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_15_ITEM7_P230_S0	The Patent Office terminated all three re-examination proceedings, and we requested an ex parte reexamination as to one of the patents.
58492_15_ITEM7_P230_S1	The Patent Office did not accept our request.
58492_15_ITEM7_P231_S0	On July 29, 2013, the plaintiff filed a second lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No.
58492_15_ITEM7_P231_S1	CV13-05463 alleging that we and Simmons Bedding Company have continued to infringe the three patents on an automatic stapling machine and the methods used to assemble boxsprings, and that the plaintiff is entitled to additional damages from January 24, 2012 forward.
58492_15_ITEM7_P231_S2	Leggett and Simmons Bedding Company filed their answers, and the Court granted summary judgment finding that the use of an earlier version of the automatic stapling machines constituted infringement, but also finding that use of a redesigned version of the machine does not infringe any Imaginal patent.
58492_15_ITEM7_P231_S3	On October 17, 2014, the parties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Limited Release, whereby Leggett agreed to pay Imaginal a cash payment, which is not material to the Company, to settle the part of the case concerning the machines found to infringe.
58492_15_ITEM7_P231_S4	Imaginal is appealing the summary judgment ruling that the redesigned stapling machines do not infringe to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
58492_15_ITEM7_P232_S0	Accrual for Loss Contingencies Although the Company denies liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we recorded, in addition to previously recognized unpaid accruals disclosed above, an additional aggregate (pre-tax) litigation accrual in continuing operations of $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 which represents our reasonable estimate of unrecorded probable loss for all pending and threatened litigation proceedings impacting continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM7_P232_S1	We expect to make most of these cash payments in 2015 with the remainder expected to be paid in 2016.
58492_15_ITEM7_P233_S0	We have relied on several facts and circumstances that have changed since the filing of our last periodic report, most significantly in January 2015, to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss and record the accrual, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
58492_15_ITEM7_P233_S1	We also recorded an additional $27 million litigation contingency accrual in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter based upon the same facts, circumstances and analysis as described above.
58492_15_ITEM7_P233_S2	We expect to make most of these cash payments in 2015 with the remainder expected to be paid in 2016.
58492_15_ITEM7_P234_S0	By far the largest portion of the accruals is for the foam antitrust proceedings.
58492_15_ITEM7_P235_S0	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current facts and circumstances, that additional reasonably possible losses (other than those Brazilian VAT matters quantified and disclosed above), are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM7_P235_S1	For more information regarding discontinued operations, please refer to Note B on page 77 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM7_P236_S0	As discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77, the FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods.
58492_15_ITEM7_P236_S1	We are currently evaluating the newly issued guidance and the impact on our future financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The table below provides information about the Company s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates.
58492_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars.
58492_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The fair value of fixed rate debt was not materially different than its $950 carrying value at December 31, 2014, and less than its $830 carrying value by $3.2 at December 31, 2013.
58492_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The increase in the fair market value of the Company s debt is primarily due to the issuance of $300 of notes in 2014 (offset by $180 note maturing), the increase in credit spreads as compared to the prior year end, increased interest rates, and the timing of interest payments.
58492_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2014 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Company s interest costs for its medium-term notes.
58492_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.
58492_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	These rates exclude the amortization of interest rate swap.

58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
58492_15_ITEM15_P11_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
58492_15_ITEM15_P12_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries ( we or our ).
58492_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States.
58492_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies.
58492_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	Legal costs are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
58492_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable.
58492_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	Legal fees are accrued when incurred.
58492_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	Other notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business.
58492_15_ITEM15_P25_S3	Other notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Interest income is not recognized for nonperforming accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_15_ITEM15_P29_S1	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
58492_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	The cost for approximately 50% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_15_ITEM15_P30_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P30_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	We have had no material changes in inventory writedowns or slow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves in any of the years presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:
58492_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Discontinued Operations For the periods presented, a business has been classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business can be clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_15_ITEM15_P35_S1	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_15_ITEM15_P38_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell.
58492_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_15_ITEM15_P42_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	Property is reviewed for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	Our reporting units are the business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management.
58492_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group.
58492_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the reporting units.
58492_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price-to-earnings ratios.
58492_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_15_ITEM15_P57_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_15_ITEM15_P57_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers.
58492_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P60_S1	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_15_ITEM15_P64_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_15_ITEM15_P66_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_15_ITEM15_P66_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute products for the various end markets described in Note F.
58492_15_ITEM15_P67_S1	Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in China, Europe, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.
58492_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_15_ITEM15_P68_S2	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of other notes receivable.
58492_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	Other notes receivable primarily consist of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business.
58492_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.
58492_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon reasonable estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P76_S2	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_15_ITEM15_P76_S3	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_15_ITEM15_P83_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_15_ITEM15_P83_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2014 presentation.
58492_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an entity.
58492_15_ITEM15_P85_S1	This guidance changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P85_S2	We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2015, and we do not believe it will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative literature, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P86_S1	This guidance will be effective January 1, 2017.
58492_15_ITEM15_P86_S2	We are currently evaluating the newly issued guidance and the impact on our future financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	During 2014, we engaged an investment banker and began exploring strategic alternatives regarding the Store Fixtures reporting unit, including the possibility of divestiture of this business.
58492_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	During the third quarter of 2014, all of the criteria to classify this unit as held for sale and discontinued operations were met.
58492_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	and recorded an after-tax loss of $4.7 , which is recognized in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	We continue to pursue the sale of the remaining portion of the reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	Store Fixtures was previously part of the Commercial Fixturing Components Segment and is classified as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	In 2013, we exited three small operations that were also recorded in discontinued operations for all periods presented:
58492_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	We closed our final location that produced wire dishwasher racks, thereby discontinuing that line of business.
58492_15_ITEM15_P90_S1	This operation was previously in our Industrial Materials segment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P90_S2	We also incurred impairment charges related to these operations in 2012 as discussed in Note C. Tax benefits related to this business were recorded in both 2012 and 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	We divested the specialty trailers portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	This branch was previously part of the Specialized Products segment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P91_S2	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business.
58492_15_ITEM15_P92_S0	We closed a cotton-based erosion control products operation that was previously part of the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P92_S1	Charges of $1.9 were recorded in 2013 to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, including $1.5 of fixed asset impairments as discussed in Note C.
58492_15_ITEM15_P93_S0	The table below includes activity related to these operations:
58492_15_ITEM15_P94_S0	(2) Subsequent activity for businesses divested in prior years has been reported as discontinued operations in the table above, including a 2014 antitrust litigation settlement of $35.3 , associated with our former Prime Foam Products unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P94_S1	Also reflected above is an unrelated cash litigation settlement of $3.9 received in 2012 associated with our Prime Foam Products unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	This unit was sold in March 2007 and was previously part of the Residential Furnishings segment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	(3) The 2014 tax benefit is primarily related to the Store Fixtures goodwill impairment and the Prime Foam litigation.
58492_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	The 2013 and 2012 tax amounts include benefits related to a worthless stock deduction and the excess outside tax basis of the subsidiary that produced wire dishwasher racks, respectively.
58492_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	Net assets held for sale by segment at December 31 were as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P98_S0	The major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31 included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items noted below were as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	This table includes $15.2 and $19.1 of property, plant and equipment held for sale at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily associated with the closings of various operations and prior year restructurings.
58492_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.
58492_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	As discussed in Note A, we test other long-lived assets for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges noted above were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers or third party estimates of fair value less selling costs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year and as triggering events may occur.
58492_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year as discussed in Note A.
58492_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach.
58492_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	Each method is generally given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P105_S2	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_15_ITEM15_P105_S3	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P105_S4	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price-to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P106_S1	The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years.
58492_15_ITEM15_P106_S2	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium.
58492_15_ITEM15_P106_S3	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_15_ITEM15_P106_S4	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_15_ITEM15_P106_S5	Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	cash flow projections are based on 10 -year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, sales growth, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	If a triggering event occurs, special consideration is given to the new circumstances when determining the fair value of the impacted reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	We performed our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, and on July 14, 2014, concluded that a goodwill impairment charge was required for one reporting unit, Store Fixtures which is now recorded as discontinued operations, and was previously part of the Commercial Fixturing and Components segment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Store Fixtures reporting unit was dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_15_ITEM15_P111_S1	Because of the seasonal nature of the fixture and display industry (where revenue and profitability were typically expected to increase in the second and third quarters assuming the normal historical pattern of heavy shipments during these months) we reasonably anticipated being awarded significant customer orders in the second quarter of 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P111_S2	However, as the second quarter progressed, anticipated orders did not materialize and the Store Fixtures business deteriorated, with declines most pronounced in May and June.
58492_15_ITEM15_P111_S3	Taking these recent developments into account, we lowered our projection of future margins and growth rates (from 4.8% in prior year's review to .5% in the current year for 10-year compound annual growth rate for EBIT plus depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)) and increased the discount rate from 10.5% to 12% , causing fair value to fall below carrying value.
58492_15_ITEM15_P111_S4	The lower expectations of future revenue and profitability were due to reduced overall market demand for the shelving, counters, showcases and garment racks as many retailers are reducing their investments in traditional store space and focusing more on e-commerce initiatives.
58492_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	Because the fair value of the Store Fixtures reporting unit had fallen below recorded book values, we performed the second step of the test which requires a fair value assessment of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to calculate an implied goodwill amount.
58492_15_ITEM15_P112_S1	This resulted in a $108.0 goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the second quarter of 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P112_S2	This charge reflects the complete impairment of all goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures reporting unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	As a result of the above circumstances, we also determined a triggering event had occurred in the second quarter to test other long-lived assets which were evaluated for impairment under the held for use model.
58492_15_ITEM15_P113_S1	No long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill) were indicated during this review.
58492_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	During the third quarter of 2014, all of the criteria to classify this unit as held for sale and discontinued operations were met as discussed in Note B.
58492_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	During 2013, we began considering strategic alternatives for our CVP unit, including possible divestiture of the business.
58492_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	Potential buyers' initial indications of value received during the second and third quarters were reasonably consistent with our fair value estimates used for the annual goodwill impairment test performed in June 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	During 2013's fourth quarter, performance of the business deteriorated.
58492_15_ITEM15_P115_S1	It became apparent in December 2013 that current market values for CVP's assets had fallen below recorded book values.
58492_15_ITEM15_P115_S2	This decline in market values of the assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and profitability, reflecting reduced market demand for the racks, shelving, and cabinets used in telecom, cable and delivery vans.
58492_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	The events of the fourth quarter were considered a triggering event, which required us to perform an impairment review.
58492_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	Because the held for sale criteria for the CVP unit was not met, it was evaluated for impairment in December under the held for use model.
58492_15_ITEM15_P116_S2	No long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill) were indicated during the fourth quarter review.
58492_15_ITEM15_P116_S3	However, we also evaluated the remaining useful life for the intangible assets resulting in accelerated amortization of $3.8 in the fourth quarter of 2013 for selected CVP customer-related intangible assets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	We determined fair value for the first step of the interim goodwill impairment test based upon market multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics as well as multiples derived from offers received during potential sale negotiations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P117_S1	These multiples were applied to lower profitability estimates, which was the result of CVP's fourth quarter business deterioration.
58492_15_ITEM15_P117_S2	Because fair value had fallen below recorded book values, we performed the second step of the test which requires a fair value assessment of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to calculate an implied goodwill amount, and a $63.0 goodwill impairment charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	The fair values of reporting units in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in the June 2014 review are presented in the table below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	The information below excludes Store Fixtures, as this unit had no goodwill remaining after the second quarter 2014 impairment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended December 31 were comprised of:
58492_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	Restructuring and restructuring-related charges (income) by segment were as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	The accrued liability associated with our total restructuring initiatives consisted of the following:
58492_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	_________________ (1) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the CVP unit as outlined in Note C. (2) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Store Fixture unit as outlined in Note C.
58492_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset class and intangible assets acquired during the period presented included in "Other intangibles" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	Estimated amortization expense for items included in our December 31, 2014 balance sheet in each of the next five years is as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	We have four operating segments that supply a wide range of products:
58492_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_15_ITEM15_P127_S1	Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief operating officer.
58492_15_ITEM15_P127_S2	The chief operating officer in turn reports directly to the chief operating decision maker.
58492_15_ITEM15_P127_S3	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory.
58492_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	We evaluate performance based on EBIT.
58492_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices.
58492_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P132_S1	Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales.
58492_15_ITEM15_P132_S2	These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	A summary of segment results for the periods presented are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance.
58492_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P134_S2	Segment assets for all years are reflected at their estimated average for the year.
58492_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	Acquired companies long-lived assets as disclosed below include property, plant and equipment and other long-term assets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	(1) Businesses sold or classified as discontinued operations during the years presented.

58492_15_ITEM15_P137_S1	Unallocated depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation of non-operating assets and amortization of debt issue costs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	Revenues from external customers, by product line, are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	Our principal operations outside of the United States are presented in the following geographic information, based on the area of manufacture.

58492_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	Maturities of long-term debt are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 of commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 12 lenders.
58492_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	The credit agreement allows us to issue total letters of credit up to $250 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_15_ITEM15_P147_S3	We had no outstanding letters of credit under the agreement at year end for the periods presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	Amounts outstanding at December 31 related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	The revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit a) the total amount of indebtedness to 60% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit agreement), b) the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) the amount of assets sold, transferred or disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 25% of total consolidated assets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	We have remained well within compliance with all such covenants.
58492_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	We may elect one of four types of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance.
58492_15_ITEM15_P150_S1	various published rates plus a pre-defined spread.
58492_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	We are required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit agreement at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P151_S1	Any outstanding principal under this agreement will be due upon the maturity date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P151_S2	We may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under this agreement, in whole or in part, upon three business days notice.
58492_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	We lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P152_S1	Lease terms, including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs, vary by lease.
58492_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	Total rental expense for the periods presented was as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	Future minimum rental commitments for all long-term non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P155_S0	The above lease obligations expire at various dates through 2024.
58492_15_ITEM15_P155_S1	Aggregate rental commitments above include renewal amounts where it is our intention to renew the lease.
58492_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.
58492_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	Shares are issued from treasury for the majority of our stock plans activity.
58492_15_ITEM15_P158_S1	All share information is presented in millions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan (the "Plan").
58492_15_ITEM15_P159_S1	On May 10, 2012 the Plan changed the way awards granted under the Plan are charged against the number of available shares.
58492_15_ITEM15_P159_S2	Under the 2012 Plan modification, each option counts as one share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as three shares against the Plan.
58492_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	At December 31, 2014, the following common shares were authorized for issuance under the Flexible Stock Plan:
58492_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation (including discontinued operations) on the results of operations for each of the periods presented:
58492_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on assets and liabilities for each of the periods presented:
58492_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a windfall tax benefit is created.
58492_15_ITEM15_P163_S1	The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital.
58492_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax shortfall is created.
58492_15_ITEM15_P164_S1	To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls, the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital.
58492_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	We have granted stock options in the following areas:
58492_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	Starting in 2013, we discontinued the annual broad-based option grant, and replaced options with cash awards, RSU's, or, for certain key management employees, participation in the Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI).
58492_15_ITEM15_P166_S1	Options are now offered only in conjunction with the Deferred Compensation Program discussed below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	Prior to 2013, we granted stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_15_ITEM15_P167_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months , 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_15_ITEM15_P167_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are amortized by the straight-line method over the options total vesting period, except for employees who terminate due to retirement.
58492_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	A retirement termination occurs if the employee is age 65 , or age 55 with 20 years of Company service at termination.
58492_15_ITEM15_P169_S1	For retirement terminations, options continue to vest and remain exercisable for three years .
58492_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	In connection with the January 2012 option grants, we offered two different option choice programs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P170_S1	One group of employees was offered the choice to receive stock options or to receive a cash payment in lieu of options, with the cash alternative being equal to approximately one-half of the Black-Scholes value of the option grant foregone.
58492_15_ITEM15_P170_S2	Another group of employees, generally higher level employees, were offered a choice between stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs), on a ratio of four options foregone for every one RSU offered.
58492_15_ITEM15_P170_S3	The stock units vest in one-third increments at 12 months , 24 months and 36 months after the date of grant.
58492_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_15_ITEM15_P172_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five , divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_15_ITEM15_P172_S2	The option has a 10 -year term.
58492_15_ITEM15_P172_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on each acquisition date and they vest immediately.
58492_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_15_ITEM15_P175_S1	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_15_ITEM15_P175_S2	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_15_ITEM15_P175_S3	Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.
58492_15_ITEM15_P175_S4	However, stock units may be settled in cash at our discretion.
58492_15_ITEM15_P175_S5	Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.
58492_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.
58492_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	Stock option information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program.
58492_15_ITEM15_P178_S1	During 2014, there were no significant options exercised at a below market exercise price, and .1 of these options remain outstanding at December 31, 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	In 2005, we amended the Program to provide only at market stock options.
58492_15_ITEM15_P179_S1	A small amount of options related to this plan (less than .1) were outstanding at December 31, 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	Additional information related to stock option activity for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P181_S0	The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
58492_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option.
58492_15_ITEM15_P183_S0	The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees.
58492_15_ITEM15_P183_S1	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility through the grant date, measured daily for a time period equal to the option s expected life.
58492_15_ITEM15_P183_S2	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_15_ITEM15_P184_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_15_ITEM15_P184_S2	In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.
58492_15_ITEM15_P185_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_15_ITEM15_P185_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P185_S2	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer accounts after three years of service.
58492_15_ITEM15_P186_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_15_ITEM15_P187_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_15_ITEM15_P187_S1	Participant contributions are credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we make premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_15_ITEM15_P187_S2	A participant s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_15_ITEM15_P187_S3	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units.
58492_15_ITEM15_P187_S4	The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company that will be settled in cash.
58492_15_ITEM15_P187_S5	Both the assets and liabilities associated with this program are presented in the table above and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions in the form of stock units.
58492_15_ITEM15_P188_S1	Company contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P188_S2	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program and may be settled in cash at our discretion.
58492_15_ITEM15_P189_S0	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P189_S1	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.
58492_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P191_S0	Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P192_S0	We also grant Performance Stock Unit (PSU) awards in the first quarter of each year to selected officers and other key managers.
58492_15_ITEM15_P192_S1	These awards contain the following conditions:
58492_15_ITEM15_P193_S0	Beginning Stock Price] as compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies.
58492_15_ITEM15_P194_S0	The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S P 500 and S P Midcap 400 (approximately 320 companies).
58492_15_ITEM15_P194_S1	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our TSR ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3 -year performance period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P195_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies.
58492_15_ITEM15_P195_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three -year vesting period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P196_S0	Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU s for the periods presented:
58492_15_ITEM15_P197_S0	Beginning with the 2010 award (that was settled in January 2013), thirty-five percent ( 35% ) of awards will be paid out in cash.
58492_15_ITEM15_P197_S1	We intend to pay out the remaining sixty-five percent ( 65% ) in shares of our common stock, although we reserve the right to pay up to one hundred percent ( 100% ) in cash.
58492_15_ITEM15_P197_S2	The 35% portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P198_S0	RSU awards are generally granted as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P199_S0	The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P200_S0	Starting in 2013, certain key management employees participated in a new PGI program in lieu of the annual option grant.
58492_15_ITEM15_P201_S0	The PGI awards are issued as growth performance stock units (GPSUs).
58492_15_ITEM15_P201_S1	The GPSUs vest ( 0% to 250% ) at the end of a two -year performance period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P201_S2	Vesting is based on the Company's or applicable profit center's revenue growth (adjusted by a GDP factor when applicable) and EBITDA margin at the end of a two-year performance period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P201_S3	The 2013 and 2014 base target PGI award was .1 shares.
58492_15_ITEM15_P202_S0	If earned, we intend to pay half in shares of our common stock and half in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_15_ITEM15_P202_S1	Both components are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P203_S0	Stock unit information for the plans discussed above is presented in the table below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P204_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the unrecognized cost of non-vested stock options and units that are not adjusted to fair value at each reporting period was as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P205_S0	Under the Discount Stock Plan (DSP), a tax-qualified 423 stock purchase plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of Leggett common stock at 85% of the closing market price on the last business day of each month.
58492_15_ITEM15_P205_S1	Shares are purchased and issued on the last business day of each month and generally cannot be sold or transferred for one year.
58492_15_ITEM15_P206_S0	The accompanying balance sheets reflect a net liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
58492_15_ITEM15_P207_S0	benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P208_S0	Participants in one of the significant domestic plans have stopped earning benefits; this plan is referred to as "frozen" in the following narrative.
58492_15_ITEM15_P209_S0	A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P210_S0	________________________ (1) The benefit obligation at December 31, 2014 increased as compared to December 31, 2013 primarily due to changes in mortality assumptions and a decrease in the discount rate.
58492_15_ITEM15_P210_S1	Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below:
58492_15_ITEM15_P211_S0	Included in the above plans is a subsidiary s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.
58492_15_ITEM15_P211_S1	This is a non-qualified plan, and these benefits are secured by insurance policies that are not included in the plan s assets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P211_S2	Cash surrender values associated with these policies at December 31 were as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P212_S0	Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions are reflected below:
58492_15_ITEM15_P213_S0	Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P214_S0	Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.
58492_15_ITEM15_P215_S0	We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points).
58492_15_ITEM15_P216_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P216_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_15_ITEM15_P217_S0	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P218_S0	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings, as discussed below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P219_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that separates fair value valuation techniques into the following categories:
58492_15_ITEM15_P220_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P221_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_15_ITEM15_P222_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_15_ITEM15_P223_S0	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_15_ITEM15_P224_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities, as well as a stable value fund.
58492_15_ITEM15_P224_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P225_S0	Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_15_ITEM15_P225_S1	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P225_S2	In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_15_ITEM15_P225_S3	Approximately 60% of our significant plans (the "frozen plans") are employing a Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% fixed income and 40% equities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P225_S4	The remaining significant plans (the "active" plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% fixed income, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_15_ITEM15_P226_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to seven different investments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P227_S0	Six are mutual funds, all of which are passively managed low-cost index funds, and include:
58492_15_ITEM15_P228_S0	Total Stock Market Index: Large -, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_15_ITEM15_P229_S0	Large-Cap Index: Large-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_15_ITEM15_P230_S0	Small-Cap Index: Small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_15_ITEM15_P231_S0	FTSE All World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world.
58492_15_ITEM15_P232_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market.
58492_15_ITEM15_P233_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term Treasury STRIPS market.
58492_15_ITEM15_P234_S0	The Stable value fund consists of a fixed income portfolio offering consistent return and protection against interest rate volatility.
58492_15_ITEM15_P235_S0	We expect to contribute $1.9 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2015.
58492_15_ITEM15_P236_S0	Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P237_S0	Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P238_S0	We have limited participation in two union-sponsored, defined benefit, multi-employer pension plans.
58492_15_ITEM15_P238_S1	These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_15_ITEM15_P238_S2	Aggregate contributions to these plans were less than $.6 for each of the years presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P239_S0	In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if a plan has unfunded vested benefits.
58492_15_ITEM15_P239_S1	Factors that could impact the funded status of these plans include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P240_S0	We have a very small share of the liability among the participants of these plans.
58492_15_ITEM15_P240_S1	Based upon the information available from plan administrators, both of the multi-employer plans in which we participate are underfunded and estimate our aggregate share of potential withdrawal liability for both plans to be $23.2 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P240_S2	We have not recorded any material withdrawal liabilities for the years presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P241_S0	The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P242_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
58492_15_ITEM15_P243_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P244_S0	For all periods presented, the tax rate benefited from income earned in various foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily related to China and Luxembourg.
58492_15_ITEM15_P244_S1	Significant items impacting each year's tax rate are:
58492_15_ITEM15_P245_S0	We recognized tax benefits totaling $13.9 , primarily related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deductions for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable provision-to-return adjustments related to prior year taxes.
58492_15_ITEM15_P245_S1	We recognized tax benefits totaling $17.5 , primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_15_ITEM15_P245_S2	The tax rate benefited from the elimination of a $36.9 valuation allowance on our Canadian net operating losses and other deferred tax assets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P245_S3	As a result of an increase in operating earnings in Canada, the amalgamation of two Canadian subsidiaries, and the restructuring of intercompany debt attributable in part to a change in Canadian tax law, we now expect those carryforwards and other deferred tax assets to be utilized in future years.
58492_15_ITEM15_P245_S4	The 2012 benefit was partially offset by the accrual of $11.2 of deferred withholding taxes in China on earnings that are no longer indefinitely reinvested in China.
58492_15_ITEM15_P246_S0	We recognized net excess tax benefits of approximately $10.1 , $4.6 , and $5.5 , and in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, related to stock plan activity, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital.
58492_15_ITEM15_P246_S1	These amounts include net windfall tax benefits as discussed in Note L.
58492_15_ITEM15_P247_S0	We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_15_ITEM15_P247_S1	In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_15_ITEM15_P247_S2	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities can no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_15_ITEM15_P247_S3	In addition, once the statute expires we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	The total amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014, is $28.2 , of which $15.8 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_15_ITEM15_P248_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P249_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_15_ITEM15_P250_S0	As of December 31, 2014, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2011 through 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P250_S1	In 2012, refunds resulting from the IRS examination of our 2004 through 2008 tax returns were received, aggregating $15.6 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P250_S2	There are no current IRS examinations in process nor are we aware of any forthcoming.
58492_15_ITEM15_P251_S0	Additionally, at December 31, 2014, eight tax years were either subject to or undergoing audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2007 through 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P251_S1	The examinations in process are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any likely material adjustments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P251_S2	During 2014, we concluded our audit for the 2011 year and released $.2 of unrecognized tax benefits.
58492_15_ITEM15_P251_S3	The Canada Revenue Agency also issued an assessment in 2014 with respect to the 2007 and 2008 years in the amount of $2.9 , related to transfer pricing issues.
58492_15_ITEM15_P251_S4	We disagree with the findings and are appealing this assessment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P251_S5	In 2013, due to Canada Revenue Agency examinations of our 2005 and 2006 tax years, we released $1.1 of unrecognized tax benefits.
58492_15_ITEM15_P252_S0	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years also remain open to examination, though we believe assessments (if any) would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P253_S0	It is reasonably possible that resolution of certain tax audits could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, as certain tax positions may be sustained on audit, or we may agree to certain adjustments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P253_S1	It is not expected that any change would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P254_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P254_S1	The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P255_S0	Significant fluctuations in our deferred taxes from 2013 to 2014 are:
58492_15_ITEM15_P256_S0	A significant portion of our increase in accrued expenses relates to a $31.8 deferred tax asset established in 2014 in connection with our Foam antitrust litigation accrual.
58492_15_ITEM15_P256_S1	Net operating losses and other tax carryforwards have decreased in large part from the utilization of Canadian net operating losses in 2014, which reduced the tax asset by $6.0 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P256_S2	Deferred tax assets associated with pension costs and other post-retirement benefits have increased primarily from changes in actuarial assumptions in 2014 totaling $17.2 , as discussed in Note M.
58492_15_ITEM15_P257_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss, tax credit, and capital loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_15_ITEM15_P257_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_15_ITEM15_P257_S2	Individually, none of these tax carryforwards presents a material exposure.
58492_15_ITEM15_P258_S0	These tax carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, with no amount greater than $10 expiring in any one year.
58492_15_ITEM15_P259_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_15_ITEM15_P260_S0	The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.
58492_15_ITEM15_P260_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we have accrued $11.2 ( $.6 related to discontinued operations) of deferred taxes associated with the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested.
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings which are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2014, are $485.8 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S2	If such earnings were distributed, we estimate that the resulting incremental tax expense would be approximately $82.2 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S3	In 2014, the foreign earnings we repatriated were immaterial, and resulted in no significant net tax benefit or cost.
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S4	Although we have not changed our assertion with respect to amounts permanently reinvested outside the U.S., in 2014 and 2012 we recorded $1.1 and $11.2 ( $.4 related to discontinued operations), respectively, for incremental withholding taxes in China, since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all of our Chinese earnings within China.
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S5	The 2012 withholding tax amount was reduced by a net $1.1 (a $1.3 decrease in continuing operations and a $.2 increase in discontinued operations) in 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S6	These taxes would be due on dividends from certain of our China subsidiaries to their foreign parent, a subsidiary of the U.S. company.
58492_15_ITEM15_P261_S7	These earnings are still permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and are included in the undistributed earnings and incremental taxes discussed above.
58492_15_ITEM15_P262_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P263_S0	The components of other (income) expense from continuing operations were as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P264_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_15_ITEM15_P265_S0	We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P266_S0	The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P267_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_15_ITEM15_P268_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P269_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_15_ITEM15_P269_S1	Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_15_ITEM15_P269_S2	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_15_ITEM15_P269_S3	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_15_ITEM15_P269_S4	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_15_ITEM15_P270_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_15_ITEM15_P271_S0	______________________________________________ * Includes both current and long-term amounts combined.
58492_15_ITEM15_P272_S0	The fair value for fixed rate debt (Level 2) was not significantly different from its $950.0 carrying value at December 31, 2014 and less than its $830.0 carrying value by $3.2 at December 31, 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P272_S1	We value this debt using discounted cash flow and secondary market rates provided by Bloomberg.
58492_15_ITEM15_P273_S0	The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note R and evaluating long-term assets (including goodwill) for potential impairment as discussed in Note C. Determining fair values for these items requires significant judgment and includes a variety of methods and models that utilize significant Level 3 inputs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P274_S0	Long-lived assets, acquisitions and the second step of a goodwill impairment test utilize the following methodologies in determining fair value: (i) Buildings and machinery are valued at an estimated replacement cost for an asset of comparable age and condition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P274_S1	Market pricing of comparable assets are used to estimate replacement cost where available.
58492_15_ITEM15_P275_S0	The most common identified intangible assets are customer relationships and tradenames.
58492_15_ITEM15_P275_S1	Customer relationships are valued using an excess earnings method, using various inputs such as the estimated customer attrition rate, future earnings forecast, the amount of contributory asset charges, and a discount rate.
58492_15_ITEM15_P275_S2	Tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty method, which is based upon comparable market royalty rates for tradenames of similar value.
58492_15_ITEM15_P276_S0	(iii) Inventory is valued at current replacement cost for raw materials, with a step-up for work in process and finished goods items that reflects the amount of ultimate profit earned as of the valuation date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P276_S1	(iv) Other working capital items are generally recorded at face value, unless there are known conditions that would impact the ultimate settlement amount of the particular item.
58492_15_ITEM15_P277_S0	The following table contains the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P277_S1	The majority of the goodwill included in the table below is expected to provide an income tax benefit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P278_S0	The following table summarizes acquisitions for the periods presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P279_S0	We are finalizing all of the information required to complete the purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_15_ITEM15_P280_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P280_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2014 and 2013 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_15_ITEM15_P281_S0	Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash at a later date and are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P281_S1	At December 31, 2014, there was no substantial remaining consideration payable.
58492_15_ITEM15_P282_S0	A brief description of our most significant acquisitions by year is included below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P282_S1	On June 30, we acquired Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring component production facilities for a purchase price of $44.5 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P282_S2	This additional volume should enhance our economies of scale, benefit from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire, and allow manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base.
58492_15_ITEM15_P282_S3	These factors contributed to the recognition of $6.6 in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P283_S0	We also acquired Kintec-Solution, a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components which became part of our motion hardware business for a purchase price of $16.8 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P283_S1	This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products, which contributed to the recognition of $4.4 in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P284_S0	We expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies:
58492_15_ITEM15_P285_S0	The first was a UK-based business that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_15_ITEM15_P285_S1	This business was acquired for a purchase price of $11.7 , and $6.1 of goodwill was recorded related to this acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P285_S2	Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included its international presence and complimentary fit with our Aerospace Products business unit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P286_S0	The second was a French company that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio for a cash purchase price of $14.5 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P286_S1	This business was acquired at a price less than fair value of the net identifiable assets, and we recorded an $8.8 non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_15_ITEM15_P286_S2	The bargain purchase gain is reported in the "Other (income) expense, net" line of our income statement.
58492_15_ITEM15_P287_S0	Prior to recognizing a bargain purchase gain, we reassessed whether all assets acquired and liabilities assumed had been correctly identified, the key valuation assumptions and business combination accounting procedures for this acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P287_S1	After careful consideration and review, we concluded that the recognition of a bargain purchase gain was appropriate for this acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P287_S2	Factors that contributed to the bargain purchase price were:
58492_15_ITEM15_P288_S0	The transaction was completed with a motivated seller that desired to restructure its operations in order to focus on its core competencies and exit in an expedient manner non-core businesses that no longer fit its strategy.
58492_15_ITEM15_P289_S0	We were able to complete the acquisition in an expedient manner, with a cash payment and without a financial contingency, which was a key attribute for the seller.
58492_15_ITEM15_P289_S1	The relatively small size of the transaction for us, the lack of required third-party financing and our expertise in completing similar transactions in the past gave the seller confidence that we could complete the transaction quickly and without difficultly.
58492_15_ITEM15_P290_S0	Because the seller of this business will continue to purchase these products in the future it was important to the seller that the acquiring company was a financially sound, integrated manufacturer that could provide a stable supply of high quality product for many years into the future.
58492_15_ITEM15_P290_S1	Due to the unique nature of the products and limited number of potential buyers for this business, the seller found it advantageous to accept our purchase price based upon our demonstrated ability to operate similar businesses, and financial strength that will enable us to be a long-term supplier of quality products into the future.
58492_15_ITEM15_P291_S0	We acquired Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western) for a cash purchase price of $188.2 forming the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.
58492_15_ITEM15_P291_S1	Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P292_S0	Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included Western's competitive position, and its fit with our strategy to seek businesses with secure, leading positions in growing, profitable, attractive markets.
58492_15_ITEM15_P293_S0	In addition, during 2012 we invested $22.4 to acquire an interest in an unconsolidated entity related to a potential acquisition.
58492_15_ITEM15_P293_S1	We had no contractual right or obligation to make any additional investment and liquidated our position for $21.2 , plus $1.8 in interest during 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P294_S0	We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P294_S1	In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks.
58492_15_ITEM15_P294_S2	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_15_ITEM15_P294_S3	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P295_S0	Derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:
58492_15_ITEM15_P296_S0	Commodity Cash Flow Hedges We have historically used commodity cash flow hedges primarily to manage natural gas commodity price risk.
58492_15_ITEM15_P296_S1	Our last natural gas commodity hedge expired during 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P297_S0	Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges On August 12, 2012, we issued $300 of 10 -year notes with a coupon rate of 3.40% .
58492_15_ITEM15_P297_S1	As a part of this transaction, we settled our $200 forward starting interest rate swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of $42.7 , which will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense over the life of the notes.
58492_15_ITEM15_P297_S2	In anticipation of the issuance of new debt, we entered into a treasury lock agreement in October 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P297_S3	The treasury lock managed benchmark treasury interest rate risk associated with $50 of the additional $300 debt issued in November 2014 and was therefore settled on that same date.
58492_15_ITEM15_P297_S4	The treasury lock had an interest rate of 2.36% .
58492_15_ITEM15_P298_S0	The settlement of the treasury lock did not result in a material gain or loss.
58492_15_ITEM15_P299_S0	The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_15_ITEM15_P300_S0	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted.
58492_15_ITEM15_P301_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_15_ITEM15_P302_S0	Our fair value hedges typically manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries assets and liabilities.
58492_15_ITEM15_P303_S0	Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings.
58492_15_ITEM15_P303_S1	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_15_ITEM15_P304_S0	We have deemed ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness.
58492_15_ITEM15_P304_S1	If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of operations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P305_S0	We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P305_S1	The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.
58492_15_ITEM15_P306_S0	Other Current Liabilities Cash flow hedges:
58492_15_ITEM15_P307_S0	The following table sets forth the pre-tax (gains) losses from continuing operations for our hedging activities for the years presented.
58492_15_ITEM15_P308_S0	This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.
58492_15_ITEM15_P309_S0	* Discontinued operations amounts included in the above:
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S0	We are a party to various proceedings and matters involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S1	When it is probable, in management's judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate liabilities in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings other than as indicated below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S3	We deny all allegations in all pending antitrust proceedings.
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S4	We will vigorously defend ourselves in all proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims.
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S5	However, we have established an accrual for the estimated amount that we believe is necessary to resolve all antitrust matters.
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S6	We also believe and expect, based on current facts and circumstances, that any reasonably possible losses incremental to the recorded accrual will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM15_P310_S7	For specific information regarding accruals please see Accrual for Loss Contingencies below.
58492_15_ITEM15_P311_S0	Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against several defendants alleging that competitors of our carpet underlay business unit and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_15_ITEM15_P311_S1	U.S. Direct Purchaser Class Action Cases.
58492_15_ITEM15_P311_S2	We were named as a defendant in three pending direct purchaser class action cases (the first on November 15, 2010) on behalf of a class of all direct purchasers of polyurethane foam products.
58492_15_ITEM15_P311_S3	The direct purchaser class action cases were all filed in or were transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_15_ITEM15_P312_S0	The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of direct purchasers, seek three times the amount of damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_15_ITEM15_P312_S1	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P313_S0	We filed motions to dismiss the U.S. direct purchaser class actions in the consolidated case in Ohio, for failure to state a legally valid claim, which were denied by the Ohio Court.
58492_15_ITEM15_P313_S1	A motion for class certification was filed on behalf of the direct purchasers.
58492_15_ITEM15_P313_S2	A hearing on the motion was held and the Court certified the direct purchaser class.
58492_15_ITEM15_P313_S3	We filed a Petition for Permission to Appeal from Class Certification Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which was denied.
58492_15_ITEM15_P314_S0	The Court ordered all parties to attend non-binding mediation with a mediator of their choosing.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S0	Tentative Settlement of U.S. Direct Purchaser Class Action Cases.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S1	We reached a tentative settlement in the U.S. direct purchaser class action cases on August 14, 2014, by agreeing to pay an aggregate amount of $39.8 , inclusive of plaintiff attorneys' fees and costs.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S2	We continue to deny all allegations in the cases, but settled the direct purchaser class cases to avoid the risk, uncertainty, expense and distraction of litigation.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S3	The settlement is subject to Court approval.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S4	We recorded a $39.8 (pre-tax) accrual for the settlement in the third quarter 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S5	In the fourth quarter of 2014, we paid $4 to the Court related to the tentative settlement.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S6	Since the accrual is partially attributable to our former Prime Foam Products business, which was sold in the first quarter of 2007, $8.3 of expense is reflected in discontinued operations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S7	The deadline for direct purchasers to exclude themselves from the litigation and settlement classes was January 26, 2015.
58492_15_ITEM15_P315_S8	A final fairness hearing was held on February 3, 2015, but we have not yet received a ruling.
58492_15_ITEM15_P316_S0	U.S. Indirect Purchaser Class Action Cases.
58492_15_ITEM15_P316_S1	We were named as a defendant in an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 and were subsequently sued in an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_15_ITEM15_P316_S2	The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of indirect purchasers, bring damages claims under various states antitrust and consumer protection statutes, and are seeking three times an amount of damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_15_ITEM15_P316_S3	Each plaintiff also seeks attorney fees, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P317_S0	We filed motions to dismiss the indirect purchaser class action, for failure to state a legally valid claim.
58492_15_ITEM15_P317_S1	The Ohio Court denied the motions to dismiss.
58492_15_ITEM15_P318_S0	Discovery is substantially complete in this case.
58492_15_ITEM15_P319_S0	A motion for class certification was filed on behalf of the indirect purchasers.
58492_15_ITEM15_P319_S1	A hearing on the motion was held and the Court certified the indirect purchaser class.
58492_15_ITEM15_P319_S2	We filed a Petition for Permission to Appeal from Class Certification Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which was denied.
58492_15_ITEM15_P319_S3	On November 18, 2014, we filed a Petition for a Writ of Certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court where it remains pending.
58492_15_ITEM15_P319_S4	The Ohio Court ordered all parties to attend non-binding mediation with a mediator of their choosing.
58492_15_ITEM15_P320_S0	We have been named as a defendant in 35 individual direct purchaser cases filed between March 22, 2011 and October 16, 2013, which were filed in or transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_15_ITEM15_P321_S0	The claims in the individual direct purchaser cases are generally the same as those asserted in the direct purchaser class action case, with the exception of one case that also alleges an indirect purchaser claim.
58492_15_ITEM15_P321_S1	Additionally, several individual direct purchaser plaintiffs bring state claims under individual states consumer protection and/or antitrust statutes in addition to their federal claims.
58492_15_ITEM15_P321_S2	Once pretrial practice concludes, some of the individual direct purchaser cases are scheduled to be tried in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and others will be remanded back to the federal district courts where the cases were originally filed for trial.
58492_15_ITEM15_P322_S0	Kansas Restraint of Trade Act Cases.
58492_15_ITEM15_P322_S1	We have been named as a defendant in two individual cases alleging direct and indirect purchaser claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, one filed on November 29, 2012 and the other on April 11, 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P322_S2	These two cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas and then transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_15_ITEM15_P322_S3	The claims and allegations of these plaintiffs are generally the same as the other direct and indirect purchaser plaintiffs, with the exception that the Kansas plaintiffs seek full consideration damages (their total purchase amounts for the allegedly price-fixed polyurethane foam products).
58492_15_ITEM15_P322_S4	Once pretrial practice concludes, this case will be remanded back to the District of Kansas federal district court for trial.
58492_15_ITEM15_P323_S0	Limited and Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, et.al.
58492_15_ITEM15_P323_S1	in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Windsor), Court File Nos. CV-10-15164 (amended November 2, 2011) and CV-11-17279 (issued December 30, 2011).
58492_15_ITEM15_P324_S0	and special damages in the amount of $100 , punitive damages of $10 , pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and the costs of the investigation and the action.
58492_15_ITEM15_P325_S0	The first issued class action is on behalf of a class of purchasers of polyurethane foam.
58492_15_ITEM15_P325_S1	The second issued class action is on behalf of purchasers of carpet underlay.
58492_15_ITEM15_P325_S2	We are not yet required to file our defenses in these or any other Canadian actions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P326_S0	In addition, on July 10, 2012, plaintiff in a class action case (for direct and indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products) styled Option Consommateurs and Karine Robillard v. Produits Vitafoam Canada Limit e, et.
58492_15_ITEM15_P326_S1	No. 500-6-524-104, filed an amended motion for authorization seeking to add us and other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products as defendants in this case, which was granted.
58492_15_ITEM15_P326_S2	This action has a pending motion for certification, which has been postponed indefinitely.
58492_15_ITEM15_P326_S3	We also were notified in June 2014 of two motions to add us as parties to two class proceedings in British Columbia.
58492_15_ITEM15_P326_S4	The motion to add us as parties to these actions has been scheduled to be heard with the motions for certification in the two actions in April 2015.
58492_15_ITEM15_P326_S5	The British Columbia actions involve British Columbia purchasers only whereas the Ontario actions propose classes of Canadian purchasers.
58492_15_ITEM15_P326_S6	No certification motions will be brought in the Ontario actions until after the British Columbia motions for certification have been determined.
58492_15_ITEM15_P327_S0	On June 22, 2012, we were made a party to a lawsuit brought in the 16 th Judicial Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri, Case Number 1216-CV15179 under the caption Dennis Baker, on Behalf of Himself and all Others Similarly Situated vs. Leggett Platt, Incorporated.
58492_15_ITEM15_P327_S1	The plaintiff, on behalf of himself and/or a class of indirect purchasers of polyurethane foam products in the State of Missouri, alleged that we violated the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act based upon our alleged illegal price inflation of flexible polyurethane foam products.
58492_15_ITEM15_P327_S2	The plaintiff seeks unspecified actual damages, punitive damages and the recovery of reasonable attorney fees.
58492_15_ITEM15_P327_S3	We filed a motion to dismiss this action, which was denied.
58492_15_ITEM15_P328_S0	Discovery has commenced and plaintiff has filed a motion for class certification.
58492_15_ITEM15_P328_S1	A hearing on the motion was held but we have yet to receive any ruling.
58492_15_ITEM15_P328_S2	We deny all of the allegations in all of the below Brazilian actions.
58492_15_ITEM15_P328_S3	We believe that we have valid bases upon which to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_15_ITEM15_P328_S4	However, these contingencies are subject to many uncertainties, and based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that it is reasonably possible (but not probable) that we may incur losses with respect to these assessments.
58492_15_ITEM15_P328_S5	Therefore, no accrual has been recorded for Brazilian VAT matters.
58492_15_ITEM15_P329_S0	On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_15_ITEM15_P329_S1	( L P Brazil ) in the amount of $2.7 , under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_15_ITEM15_P330_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.
58492_15_ITEM15_P330_S1	L P Brazil responded to the notice of violation denying the violation.

58492_15_ITEM15_P330_S10	In addition, L P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012, and September 13, 2013 from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L P Brazil s use of certain tax credits in the years 2005 through 2010.
58492_15_ITEM15_P330_S11	Such credits are generated based upon the tariff classification and rate used by L P Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings.
58492_15_ITEM15_P330_S12	On September 4, 2014, the tax authorities issued five additional assessments regarding this same issue (use of credits), covering certain periods of 2011 and 2012.

58492_15_ITEM15_P331_S2	L P Brazil argued the payments were not required to be made because of the application of certain tax credits that were generated by L P Brazil's use of a correct tariff code for the classification of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings (i.e., the same underlying issue at stake in the other Brazilian matters).
58492_15_ITEM15_P331_S3	On June 26, 2014, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued a new notice of violation against L P Brazil in the amount of $.9 , under Case No. 10660.721523/2014-87, covering the period from 2011 through 2012 on the same subject matter.

58492_15_ITEM15_P333_S0	L P Brazil is party to a proceeding involving the State of S o Paulo, Brazil where the State of S o Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking $2.1 for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n .04-256.169/2009).
58492_15_ITEM15_P333_S1	The State of S o Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of S o Paulo.

58492_15_ITEM15_P337_S4	We appealed to the second administrative level, which affirmed the first administrative level ruling.

58492_15_ITEM15_P337_S6	L P Brazil filed its response, a Motion to Stay of Execution, on June 5, 2014.
58492_15_ITEM15_P338_S0	Patent Infringement Claim At this time, we do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM15_P339_S0	On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble boxsprings.
58492_15_ITEM15_P339_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_15_ITEM15_P339_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_15_ITEM15_P339_S3	On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent s validity and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_15_ITEM15_P340_S0	At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P340_S1	The court denied plaintiff s attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.
58492_15_ITEM15_P340_S2	We appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_15_ITEM15_P341_S0	Oral argument was held before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C.
58492_15_ITEM15_P341_S1	The Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 verdict against us, which was fully accrued for in the first quarter of 2013 and then paid in the second quarter of 2013.
58492_15_ITEM15_P341_S2	We filed a petition for a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision which was denied.
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S0	The plaintiff requested royalties for post-verdict use of the machines, and requested pre-judgment interest in the amount of $.7 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S1	The District Court ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to additional ongoing royalties for our continued use of the machines, but did award pre-judgment interest of $.5 .
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S2	Both parties filed a notice of appeal of this order to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but plaintiff has since withdrawn its appeal.
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S3	We also filed reexamination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue in the lawsuit the plaintiff brought.
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S4	The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the key claims of one of the three patents.
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S5	The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second of the patents, but subsequently reversed that decision.
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S6	With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims.
58492_15_ITEM15_P342_S7	All three of these proceedings were appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals.
58492_15_ITEM15_P343_S0	The plaintiff filed petitions to terminate all re-examination proceedings based on the final ruling of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_15_ITEM15_P344_S0	The Patent Office terminated all three re-examination proceedings, and we requested an ex parte reexamination as to one of the patents.
58492_15_ITEM15_P344_S1	The Patent Office did not accept our request.
58492_15_ITEM15_P345_S0	On July 29, 2013, the plaintiff filed a second lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No.
58492_15_ITEM15_P345_S1	CV13-05463 alleging that we and Simmons Bedding Company have continued to infringe the three patents on an automatic stapling machine and the methods used to assemble boxsprings, and that the plaintiff is entitled to additional damages from January 24, 2012 forward.
58492_15_ITEM15_P345_S2	Leggett and Simmons Bedding Company filed their answers, and the Court granted summary judgment finding that the use of an earlier version of the automatic stapling machines constituted infringement, but also finding that use of a redesigned version of the machine does not infringe any Imaginal patent.
58492_15_ITEM15_P345_S3	On October 17, 2014, the parties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Limited Release, whereby Leggett agreed to pay Imaginal a cash payment, which is not material to the Company, to settle the part of the case concerning the machines found to infringe.
58492_15_ITEM15_P345_S4	Imaginal is appealing the summary judgment ruling that the redesigned stapling machines do not infringe to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
58492_15_ITEM15_P346_S0	Accrual for Loss Contingencies Although the Company denies liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we recorded, in addition to previously recognized unpaid accruals disclosed above, an additional aggregate (pre-tax) litigation accrual in continuing operations of $22 in the fourth quarter of 2014 which represents our reasonable estimate of unrecorded probable loss for all pending and threatened litigation proceedings impacting continuing operations.
58492_15_ITEM15_P346_S1	We expect to make most of these cash payments in 2015 with the remainder expected to be paid in 2016.

58492_15_ITEM15_P347_S2	We expect to make most of these cash payments in 2015 with the remainder expected to be paid in 2016.
58492_15_ITEM15_P348_S0	By far the largest portion of the accruals is for the foam antitrust proceedings.
58492_15_ITEM15_P349_S0	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current facts and circumstances, that additional reasonably possible losses (other than those Brazilian VAT matters quantified and disclosed above), are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_15_ITEM15_P349_S1	For more information regarding discontinued operations, please refer to footnote B on page 77 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

58492_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, automobiles and commercial aircraft.
58492_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	As discussed below, our continuing operations are organized into 17 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Products; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.
58492_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.
58492_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Innovative proprietary products and low cost have made us the largest U.S. manufacturer in many of these businesses.
58492_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting those end-consumer needs.
58492_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	We attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, purchasing leverage, and large-scale production.
58492_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	Sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising, and marketing their products.
58492_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	In our Commercial Products segment we design, manufacture, and distribute a wide range of components and finished products for the office seating and specialty retail markets.
58492_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	We are a major supplier of fashion beds and adjustable beds, with domestic manufacturing and distribution capability as well as established relationships with global sources.
58492_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	The quality of our products and service, together with our low cost, have made Leggett Platt the leading U.S. supplier of high carbon drawn steel wire.
58492_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_16_ITEM1_P4_S2	We have three wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_16_ITEM1_P4_S3	We also supply steel wire to external customers that operate in a broad range of markets.
58492_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	We sold our Steel Tubing business in the fourth quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	This unit supplied steel tubing to many external customers, including automotive seat frame producers, and also supplied a portion of our internal needs.
58492_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	We use about 70% of our wire output to manufacture our own products, including:
58492_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Industrial Materials segment also has a diverse group of external customers that include:
58492_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, manufactures and sells products including automotive seating components, tubing for the aerospace industry, specialized machinery and equipment, and service van interiors.
58492_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our established design capability and focus on product development have made us a leader in innovation.
58492_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	We also benefit from our broad geographic presence and our internal production of key raw materials and components.
58492_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	We are considering strategic alternatives for our CVP Group, including the possible divestiture of this business.
58492_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	For more information, please refer to Commercial Vehicle Products Divestiture on page 31.
58492_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price.
58492_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through a balanced approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2015, we met our goal of producing TSR in the top third of the S P 500.
58492_16_ITEM1_P10_S4	We generated compounded annual TSR of 20% per year, on average, over the last three years, significantly better than the S P 500's 15% annual TSR over the same time period.
58492_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth.
58492_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control.
58492_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	During the past three years, we generated approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
58492_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR.
58492_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $.32 per share.
58492_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Our target for dividend payout is 50-60% of earnings, however actual payout has been higher in recent years (88% in 2013 and 179% in 2014, impacted by goodwill impairment in both years and litigation accruals in 2014).
58492_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	As a result, dividend growth has been modest, at about 3% per year.
58492_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	With significant earnings improvement in 2015, dividend payout for the year was 55%, within the target range.
58492_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	This allows us flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with EPS growth.
58492_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have consistently (for over 25 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash.
58492_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	During the last three years, we repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares of our stock and issued 9.1 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 5%.
58492_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	In 2015, we repurchased 4.3 million shares (at an average of $45.72) and issued 2.1 million shares (at an average of $23.61).
58492_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest).
58492_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), operating cash flows, and return on assets.
58492_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets.
58492_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, improve market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Long-term, we aim to achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually.
58492_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity.
58492_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	First, we must develop and commercialize innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions.
58492_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms: opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.
58492_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our long-term 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing TSR; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
58492_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	We acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings for a purchase price of $23 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	We will acquire the remaining 30% over the next five years, under the terms of the agreement, and have recorded a long-term liability of approximately $10 million for the future payments.
58492_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Future payments are based upon a calculation that incorporates future EBITDA.
58492_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	The recorded liability is based upon estimates and may fluctuate significantly until the 2018 and 2020 payment dates.
58492_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	Fluctuations in this liability will be reflected in interest income or expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
58492_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	We acquired Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring component production facilities for a purchase price of $45 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	This additional volume enhanced our economies of scale, benefited from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire, and allowed manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base.
58492_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	These factors contributed to the recognition of $18 million in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for a purchase price of $17 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products, which contributed to the recognition of $4 million in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	We expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	The first was a UK-based business that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	This business was acquired for a purchase price of $12 million, and $6 million of goodwill was recorded related to this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included its international presence and complimentary fit with our Aerospace Products business unit.
58492_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	The second was a French company that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio for a cash purchase price of $15 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	This business was acquired at a price less than fair value of the net identifiable assets, and we recorded a $9 million non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	The bargain purchase gain is reported in the "Other (income) expense, net" line of our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	For more information regarding our acquisitions and factors that contributed to the bargain purchase price referenced above, please refer to Note R on page 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	We sold our final two Store Fixtures operations for $8 million and recorded an after-tax gain of $3 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	These divestitures were reported in discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	We sold our Steel Tubing business unit for total consideration of $25 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	This operation reached held for sale status in the first quarter of 2015, but did not meet the requirements for discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	The results for this operation (including a pre-tax loss on sale of $3 million) was included in the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Finally, we divested a small operation within our CVP business for $3 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	The business was reported in our Specialized Products segment and did not meet the requirements for discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	We divested the majority of the Store Fixtures group for total consideration of $64 million and recorded an after-tax loss of $5 million.
58492_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Store Fixtures group was previously part of the Commercial Products segment and was reported in discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	There were no significant divestitures in 2013.
58492_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 76 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Because of the divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business in late 2014, along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products.
58492_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products.
58492_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	The Spuhl machinery operation (which produces wire forming equipment primarily for our internal use) was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings.
58492_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials.
58492_16_ITEM1_P39_S4	These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.
58492_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note F on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	The percentages of our external sales in continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our international operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico.
58492_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	Our products in these foreign locations primarily consist of:
58492_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	Adjustable beds Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for our components is growing.
58492_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.
58492_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 65% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	We have manufacturing facilities in countries around the world, as shown below.
58492_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	For further information concerning our continuing operations external sales related to products manufactured, and our tangible long-lived assets located outside the United States, refer to Note F on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	The following table shows our approximate percentage of continuing operations external sales by classes of similar products for the last three years:
58492_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel.
58492_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
58492_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials.
58492_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	In 2015, our largest customer accounted for approximately 8% of our consolidated revenues.
58492_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 29% of these consolidated revenues.
58492_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Products and Specialized Products segments.
58492_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations as of December 31, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
58492_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.
58492_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	One of our strongest performing product categories across the company is ComfortCore , our fabric-encased spring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses.
58492_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Many mattress producers have moved to higher valued innersprings like ComfortCore in more of their product lines, typically replacing foam cores or traditional innersprings.
58492_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	Our ComfortCore volume has continued to grow, and represented 30% of our total U.S. innerspring units in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	We maintain research, development and testing centers in many locations around the world.
58492_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_16_ITEM1_P58_S2	However, we estimate the cost of research and development was approximately $25 million in each of the last three years.
58492_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 20,000 employees, of which roughly 15,000 were engaged in production.
58492_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Of the 20,000, approximately 11,000 were international employees (5,600 in China).
58492_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Roughly 15% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues.
58492_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2015.
58492_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2016.
58492_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.
58492_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 19,000 employees.
58492_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well.
58492_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued.
58492_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_16_ITEM1_P67_S3	Also, a case brought in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers resulted in a ruling in December 2014, and the implementation of antidumping duties of 106% to 110% and countervailing duties of 178% to 193% on imports of Chinese steel wire rod through December 2019.
58492_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress has passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act.
58492_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	The ENFORCE Act requires CBP to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.
58492_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and dispositions, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses.
58492_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have slightly higher sales, while the first and fourth quarters have generally been lower.
58492_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	Segment level seasonality has also been relatively limited, however the Residential Furnishings segment usually has lower sales in the fourth quarter and the Specialized Products segment typically experiences lower sales in the third quarter.
58492_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of Cash from Operations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 40.
58492_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.
58492_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
58492_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section.
58492_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
58492_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	In addition to these reports, the Company s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section.

58492_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves risk.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed and this would negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Higher raw material costs in past years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings and Industrial Materials product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If this was to occur again it could negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We previously disclosed that we were a party to a series of civil antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam products.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	During 2015, we settled the substantial majority of these cases but there are a few cases yet to be resolved.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Although we deny liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have, at December 31, 2015, an aggregate litigation contingency accrual of $8 million.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The accrual amount decreased from the prior year primarily due to cash payments for litigation settlements of $82 million.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies (which include Brazilian VAT, antitrust, patent, and other matters) are estimated to be $25 million.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	If our assumptions or analysis regarding these contingencies is incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the $25 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	For more information regarding our legal contingencies, see Note T on page 114 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In 2015, 31% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	At December 31, 2015, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $998 million, or 34% of our total assets.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled $658 million, or 22% of total assets.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which would negatively impact our earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	For more information regarding potential goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment, refer to Note C on page 79 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of, and collections from, our customers, and manage the accounting for, and payment to, our vendors.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We expect to transition certain corporate-level shared service systems primarily related to our domestic U.S. operations for general ledger, sales invoicing, cash application, purchasing and accounts payable disbursements to a new platform during the last half of 2016 and the first half of 2017.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure could create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flow and earnings.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover and interest rates.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our components and products.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, low consumer confidence, or a depressed housing market could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri.
58492_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	We currently have 130 manufacturing locations, of which 81 are located across the United States and 49 are located in 18 foreign countries.
58492_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	For more information regarding the geographic location of our manufacturing facilities refer to "Geographic Areas of Operation" under Item 1 Business on page 11.
58492_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	In 2015, seventy-one percent of the Company's net sales allocated to the 130 manufacturing facilities was produced by owned facilities.
58492_16_ITEM2_P2_S1	We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_16_ITEM2_P2_S2	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note K on page 92 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of our 130 manufacturing facilities, none are subject to liens or encumbrances that are material to the segment in which they are reported or to the Company as a whole.
58492_16_ITEM2_P4_S0	None of our physical properties are, by themselves, material to the Company s overall manufacturing processes, except for our steel rod mill in Sterling, Illinois, which is reported in Industrial Materials.
58492_16_ITEM2_P4_S1	The rod mill consists of approximately 1 million square feet of production space and has annual output of approximately 500,000 tons of steel rod, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_16_ITEM2_P4_S2	Although we have alternative sources of steel rod from external sources, a prolonged disruption to the operation of the rod mill could have a material adverse effect on the Industrial Materials segment and the Company s results of operations.
58492_16_ITEM2_P5_S0	In the opinion of management, the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_16_ITEM2_P5_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_16_ITEM2_P5_S2	Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_16_ITEM2_P5_S3	However, utilization has increased in many of our businesses with improving market demand, and we are investing to support rapid growth in a few of our businesses, including Automotive, U.S. Spring, European Spring and Adjustable Bed.
58492_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	The information in Note T beginning on page 114 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.
58492_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	On October 17, 2008, the Company, along with Carpenter Co., Flexible Foam Products, Inc., Foam Supplies, Inc., Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, J.M. Huber Corporation, Lubrizol Advanced Materials, Inc., The Sherwin-Williams Company, Skypark Manufacturing, LLC, Vitafoam Incorporated; and their respective affiliates, as plaintiffs, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under the caption Carpenter Co., et al. v. BASF SE, et al., Case No. 2:08-cv-05169 against BASF Corporation, The Dow Chemical Company, Huntsman International LLC, Lyondell Chemical Company, and their affiliates, alleging that defendants conspired to fix prices and allocate customers and markets for certain urethane chemical products.
58492_16_ITEM3_P1_S1	The Company previously settled its claims against certain defendants for immaterial amounts and all other defendants have been dismissed except for The Dow Chemical Company.
58492_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	The Company, along with co-plaintiffs, seeks to recover three times the amount of damages suffered as a result of the alleged overcharges in the price of the urethane chemical products purchased from the defendant from at least 1994 through at least 2004.
58492_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	The plaintiffs also seek attorney fees, pre-judgment interest and injunctive relief.
58492_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	Based on the maturation of the proceeding, discovery becoming substantially complete, and the scheduled trial date of March 7, 2016, the Company now believes that it is reasonably likely that it may recover material damages from the defendant.
58492_16_ITEM3_P2_S3	However, because of uncertainties, the Company cannot estimate the amount of recovery.
58492_16_ITEM3_P2_S4	Also, because of these uncertainties, it is possible that the Company may recover only an immaterial amount of the alleged damages, or recover no damages at all.
58492_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	On March 27, 2013, Region 5 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Notice of Violation/Finding of Violation ("NOV/FOV") alleging that our subsidiary, Sterling Steel Company, violated the Clean Air Act and the Illinois State Implementation Plan currently in place.
58492_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	Sterling operates a steel rod mill in Sterling, Illinois.
58492_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	The NOV/FOV alleges that Sterling, since 2008, has exceeded the allowable annual particulate matter and manganese emission limits for its electric arc furnace.
58492_16_ITEM3_P4_S2	Sterling requested a conference with the EPA to discuss the alleged violations.
58492_16_ITEM3_P4_S3	The conference was held on May 20, 2013.
58492_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	On July 23, 2013, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation alleging that Sterling violated the opacity limitations of its air permit and Federal and state regulations.
58492_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	A conference to discuss the Finding of Violation occurred in the third quarter of 2013.
58492_16_ITEM3_P6_S0	There had been no material updates with respect to these matters until mid-July 2015 when the Company learned from counsel for the EPA that the matters had been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
58492_16_ITEM3_P6_S1	The Company met with representatives of the DOJ on February 2, 2016.
58492_16_ITEM3_P6_S2	At the meeting, the DOJ focused on Sterling s compliance with capture and control efficiency and fugitive emissions with its electric arc furnace.
58492_16_ITEM3_P6_S3	Sterling intends to vigorously defend these matters in any enforcement action that may be pursued by the EPA or DOJ.
58492_16_ITEM3_P6_S4	Neither the EPA nor DOJ specified any amount of penalty or injunctive relief being sought in the NOV/FOV, Finding of Violation or in any conference or meeting.
58492_16_ITEM3_P6_S5	Any settlement or adverse finding could result in the payment by Sterling of fines, penalties, capital expenditures, or some combination thereof.
58492_16_ITEM3_P6_S6	Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.

58492_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol LEG).
58492_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below highlights quarterly and annual stock market information for the last two years.
58492_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Price and volume data reflect composite transactions; price range reflects intra-day prices; data source is Bloomberg.
58492_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 12, 2016, we had 8,745 shareholders of record.
58492_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	Increasing the dividend remains a priority.
58492_16_ITEM5_P4_S1	We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $.32 per share.
58492_16_ITEM5_P4_S2	Our target for dividend payout is 50-60% of earnings, however actual payout has been higher in recent years (88% in 2013 and 179% in 2014, impacted by goodwill impairment in both years and litigation accrual in 2014).
58492_16_ITEM5_P4_S3	As a result, dividend growth has been modest, at about 3% per year.
58492_16_ITEM5_P4_S4	With significant earnings improvement in 2015, dividend payout for the year was 55%, within the target range.
58492_16_ITEM5_P4_S5	This allows us flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with EPS growth.
58492_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	We have consistently (for over 25 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	We expect this again to be the case in 2016.
58492_16_ITEM5_P5_S2	We have no restrictions that currently materially limit our ability to pay such dividends or that we reasonably believe are likely to limit the future payment of dividends.
58492_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	See the discussion of the Company s targeted dividend payout ratio under Pay Dividends in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 44.
58492_16_ITEM5_P7_S0	The table below is a listing of our purchases of the Company s common stock during each calendar month of the fourth quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM5_P8_S0	(1) This number includes 17,648 shares which were not repurchased as part of a publicly announced plan or program, all of which were shares surrendered in transactions permitted under the Company s benefit plans.
58492_16_ITEM5_P8_S1	It does not include shares withheld for taxes on option exercises and stock unit conversions, or forfeitures of restricted stock units.
58492_16_ITEM5_P8_S2	(2) On August 4, 2004, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year beginning January 1, 2005.
58492_16_ITEM5_P8_S3	This standing authorization was first reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, filed August 5, 2004, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors.
58492_16_ITEM5_P8_S4	As such, effective January 1, 2016, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2016.
58492_16_ITEM5_P8_S5	No specific repurchase schedule has been established.
58492_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	All amounts are presented after tax.
58492_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2015 includes $4 million of impairments and $2 million on the loss on the sale of our steel tubing business; $4 million associated with litigation accruals; and $8 million lump sum pension buyout.
58492_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2014 includes $33 million associated with litigation accruals.
58492_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	Discontinued Operations includes the following items: $93 million of goodwill impairment, a $5 million loss on the sale of the majority of our Store Fixtures unit, and $22 million associated with litigation accruals.
58492_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2013 include charges of $45 million related to the Commercial Vehicle Products group ($43 million goodwill impairment charge and $2 million accelerated amortization of a customer-related intangible asset), and a $9 million bargain purchase gain related to an acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2012 include a $27 million net tax benefit primarily related to the release of valuation allowances on certain Canadian deferred tax assets, partially offset by deferred withholding taxes on earnings in China.
58492_16_ITEM6_P4_S0	The Company incurred asset impairment and restructuring-related charges totaling $28 million in 2011.
58492_16_ITEM6_P4_S1	Of these charges, $13 million were associated with continuing operations and $15 million were related to discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased significantly (versus 2014) reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense.
58492_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Sales from continuing operations also grew in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.
58492_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.
58492_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	A major component of our strategy since 2007 has been the optimization of our portfolio of businesses, by increasing investment in businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive.
58492_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	In 2015, we made further progress on both fronts.
58492_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	During the year, we expanded our operations to support continued growth of our Automotive business, invested in machinery to support the growing demand for ComfortCore innersprings, and added three new facilities to support growth in our Adjustable Bed business.
58492_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	We also acquired, in our Work Furniture business, a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	Additionally, in 2015, we completed the divestitures of several small operations including our Steel Tubing business, the two remaining Store Fixtures operations, and a small part of the Commercial Vehicle Products business.
58492_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	Operating cash decreased versus 2014 levels, primarily due to payments made to settle foam litigation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	However, we once again generated more than enough cash from operations to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we've accomplished for over 25 years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	2015 marked the 44th consecutive annual dividend increase for the company, with a compound annual growth rate of 13% over that time period.
58492_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	Only one other S P 500 company can claim as high a rate of dividend growth for as many years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	We ended 2015 with net debt to net capital comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	In August, we repaid $200 million of notes that matured.
58492_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	We ended the year with over $400 million available under our commercial paper program.
58492_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	We target TSR in the top third of the S P 500 over the long term.
58492_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	For the three years ended December 31, 2015, we generated TSR of 20% per year on average.
58492_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	That placed us in the top third of the S P 500, meeting our long-term goal.
58492_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay [TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price].
58492_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	We seek to achieve TSR in the top third of the S P 500 over the long-term through a balanced approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S P 500) on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2015, we met our top third TSR goal.
58492_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	We generated TSR of 20% per year on average over the last three years, well above the S P 500's 15% annual TSR for that same time period.
58492_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 8% of our sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized.
58492_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	They include most producers of residential furniture and bedding, auto and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.
58492_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod.
58492_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	This is a benefit that our competitors do not have.
58492_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs and we also realize a lag as costs decline, as was the case in the last half of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Throughout 2015, market prices for steel scrap, rod, and flat-rolled products decreased significantly, leading to downward pressure on selling prices.
58492_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	pricing lag during the year, as costs generally decreased at a faster rate than selling prices.
58492_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Assuming that steel costs stabilize, we expect that 2015's pricing lag benefit will not recur in 2016.
58492_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile during certain periods in recent years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	In late 2013 and early 2014, metal margins decreased significantly as market conditions did not allow full recovery of higher scrap costs.
58492_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the implementation of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod.
58492_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	The antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P18_S5	Both remain in effect through December 2019.
58492_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years, and in most years, have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality and manage the cost of their products, while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Many of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering better product quality, innovation, and customer service.
58492_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued.
58492_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act.
58492_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	The ENFORCE Act requires CBP to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.
58492_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	We previously disclosed that we were one of several defendants in a series of civil antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam.
58492_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	During 2015, we settled the substantial majority of these cases.
58492_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Although there are a few cases yet to be resolved, based upon current facts, we do not believe that the outcome of these remaining cases will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow.
58492_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Although we deny liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have an aggregate litigation contingency accrual of $8 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The accrual amount decreased from the prior year primarily due to cash payments for litigation settlements of $82 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	Based upon current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies are estimated to be $25 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	These include Brazilian VAT, antitrust, patent, and other matters.
58492_16_ITEM7_P27_S4	For more information regarding litigation contingency accruals and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.
58492_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	We are also a plaintiff in an antitrust case against The Dow Chemical Company.
58492_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	We, along with other plaintiffs, have alleged that several defendants conspired to fix prices and allocate customers and markets for certain urethane chemical products.
58492_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	The trial is scheduled to begin on March 7, 2016.
58492_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	We believe that it is reasonably likely that we may recover material damages.
58492_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	However, because of uncertainties we cannot estimate the amount of recovery, and it is possible that we won't recover any damages at all.
58492_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	For more information regarding our antitrust litigation, see Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.
58492_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	For information regarding discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.
58492_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June of each year, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	We performed our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, and on July 14, 2014, concluded that an impairment charge of $108 million ($93 million after tax) was required for our Store Fixtures group.
58492_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	This non-cash impairment charge reflected the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures group and was recognized in discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	For more information, see Note C to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	On November 1, 2014, we sold the majority of the Store Fixtures business for $64 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	These divested operations represented approximately three-quarters of the business unit's revenues.
58492_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	The transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $5 million, which was recognized in discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	The two remaining Store Fixtures facilities were sold in 2015 and resulted in an after-tax gain of $3 million, which was also recognized in discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	In late 2015, we sold a small CVP operation that did not meet the discontinued operations criteria, leaving two remaining operations within that group.
58492_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	In February 2016, one of these operations reached held-for-sale status.
58492_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	Under a separate arrangement, we have agreed to sell real estate associated with the CVP unit and expect to realize a gain on this transaction.
58492_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	The real estate sale is subject to certain contingencies, which we anticipate will be resolved within the next twelve months.
58492_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	We will continue to explore strategic alternatives for the remaining CVP operation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Because of the divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business in late 2014, along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products.
58492_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Aerospace business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products.
58492_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Spuhl machinery operation (which produces wire forming equipment primarily for our internal use) was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials.
58492_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.
58492_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Sales from continuing operations grew 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.
58492_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year, from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.
58492_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Full year earnings from continuing operations increased significantly reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense.
58492_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2015, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Same location sales (from continuing operations) grew 1%, with volume gains in Automotive, in most of our Residential Furnishings businesses, and in Adjustable Bed, largely offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.
58492_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Full-year 2015 sales growth also benefited from the July 2014 acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities, the March 2015 acquisition of a Work Furniture business, and other smaller acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The divestiture of the Steel Tubing business occurred in late December, and did not significantly impact the full year sales comparison.
58492_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased significantly in 2015, primarily from higher sales and pricing discipline.
58492_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	As indicated in the table above, earnings also benefited from the reduction in foam litigation expense ($3 million in 2015 versus $33 million in 2014; further discussed on page 114).
58492_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	Partially offsetting these improvements was a one-time lump sum pension buyout funded from pension plan assets late in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	Significant deflation in steel costs during 2015 resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.
58492_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net interest expense in 2015 increased slightly versus 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our 2015 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 27%, compared to 24% for 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The 2015 tax rate benefited from $11 million of favorable adjustments, including a reduction associated with changes to our permanent reinvestment assertions in China, and a tax benefit associated with our Australian operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	The 2014 tax rate includes $14 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	These adjustments benefited our 2014 rate more favorably due to lower pretax income.
58492_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	In the following section we discuss 2015 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) from continuing operations for each of our segments.
58492_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Prior year segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.
58492_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 5% in 2015, with unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact.
58492_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, and Fabric Converting.
58492_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	Within our U.S. Spring business, we again experienced significant growth in ComfortCore (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 51%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new ComfortCore products and our customers' growing use of these components in their product lines.
58492_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015 due to higher sales, pricing discipline, and significantly lower foam litigation expense ($48 million).
58492_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Sales in Commercial Products increased 21% in 2015, with same location sales up 12%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	Continued strong demand in the Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove this improvement.
58492_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Unit volume in the Adjustable Bed business increased 51% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs.
58492_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	Acquisitions also contributed 9% to the segment's sales growth during the year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	In our Work Furniture business, we acquired a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015, primarily from higher sales and improved operating efficiency.
58492_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Sales in the segment decreased 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel-related price decreases and reduced rod mill trade sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin improved versus 2014, with cost reductions more than offsetting $6 million of impairment charges and a $3 million loss on divestiture, both of which related to our Steel Tubing business.
58492_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2015, with volume gains in Automotive and Machinery partially offset by currency impact.
58492_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and continued industry growth in each of the major markets.
58492_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased primarily from higher sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $1 million from a loss of $124 million in 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	This significant increase is primarily due to the non-recurrence of an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114.
58492_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.
58492_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Sales from continuing operations grew 9% in 2014 from a combination of strong organic growth in many of our major businesses and acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Earnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, largely due to sales growth.
58492_16_ITEM7_P60_S2	Other items in 2013 and 2014 essentially offset.
58492_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2014, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Same location sales (from continuing operations) grew 6%, reflecting strong volume gains in Automotive and in most of the company's Residential Furnishings businesses.
58492_16_ITEM7_P63_S1	These improvements were partially offset by weak demand in Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP).
58492_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Sales growth in 2014 also benefited from the acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities and other smaller acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	In conjunction with the purchase of the facilities from Tempur Sealy, we expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy and boxsprings for Sealy.
58492_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased in 2014, with several items contributing to the year-over-year comparison.
58492_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	Operationally, earnings growth resulted primarily from higher sales, however this benefit was partially offset by higher stock compensation expense that resulted in large part from the significant increase in Leggett Platt share price versus the market in late 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	Reduced metal margins in our steel rod and wire operations and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in the year also offset some of the earnings benefit from higher sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	As indicated in the table above, a few additional items impacted the year-over-year earnings comparison.
58492_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Earnings from continuing operations in 2014 were negatively impacted by litigation accruals, which primarily related to the foam antitrust cases discussed on page 114.
58492_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	Steel inflation in late 2013 resulted in full-year LIFO expense of $4 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.
58492_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Net interest expense in 2014 decreased slightly versus 2013.
58492_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Our 2014 worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 24%, compared to 22% for 2013.
58492_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	The 2014 tax rate benefited from $14 million of favorable adjustments, including additional Domestic Production Activities Deduction tax benefits for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable adjustments related to prior year tax return filings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	The 2013 tax rate includes $17 million of favorable adjustments primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state tax audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	In the following section we discuss 2014 sales and EBIT from continuing operations for each of our segments.
58492_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84.
58492_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	All segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment structure discussed on page 31.
58492_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P73_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on external sales.
58492_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 14% in 2014, from unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions (including the purchase of the three Tempur Sealy innerspring production facilities).
58492_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, Fabric Converting, and Carpet Cushion, from a combination of market share gains and broadly improving market demand in the second half of the year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P74_S2	Within our U.S. Spring business, we experienced significant growth in ComfortCore (our pocketed coil innerspring), with unit volume in that product category up 52%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P74_S3	Mattress producers continued to integrate these higher-valued innersprings into more of their product lines, in many cases replacing lower-valued innersprings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	In our Furniture Hardware business, unit volume increased 10% as consumer demand for reclining chairs and sofas continued to grow.
58492_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin decreased in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales more than offset by a $54 million accrual related to the foam litigation discussed on page 114, and higher stock compensation expense.
58492_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	Sales in Commercial Products increased 10% in 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Demand was extremely strong in our Adjustable Bed business, with unit volume increasing 56% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs.
58492_16_ITEM7_P77_S2	We also benefited from market share gains and improved market demand in our Work Furniture business.
58492_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	EBIT improved slightly and EBIT margin was flat in 2014, with the benefit from higher sales partially offset by operational challenges with a Chinese joint venture.
58492_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Sales in the segment increased 3% in 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	Growth in logistics services (primarily with other Leggett operations) was partially offset by reduced trade sales from our rod mill and lower wire volume.
58492_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin declined versus 2013, primarily due to reduced metal margin in our steel rod and wire operations, and weather-related costs and inefficiencies early in 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 12% in 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	Same location sales were up 8% and Aerospace acquisitions completed in 2013 also contributed to the full-year sales growth.
58492_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth, with sales up 17% from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and demand strength in each of the major markets.
58492_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	Partially offsetting this growth, CVP sales declined 21%, reflecting delayed vehicle replacement by major fleet operators and a change in an OEM incentive program.
58492_16_ITEM7_P81_S4	Machinery sales increased modestly for the year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased due to higher sales and the non-recurrence of impairment and other charges (of $67 million) related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of our CVP business that were recognized in 2013.
58492_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to a loss of $124 million in 2014 (versus earnings of $13 million in 2013).
58492_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	This significant decline is primarily due to an impairment charge of $93 million related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures business discussed on page 80, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million discussed on page 114.
58492_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	The divestiture of the majority of that business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P83_S3	Earnings in 2013 reflected an $8 million tax benefit attributable to another small operation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P83_S4	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 76.
58492_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Our operations provide most of the cash we require, and debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs.
58492_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	Cash from operations was once again strong in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	For over 25 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments.
58492_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	We expect this to again be the case in 2016.
58492_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Capital expenditures increased in 2015 from investments to support growth in Automotive, U.S. Spring, and Adjustable Bed.
58492_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	We increased the quarterly dividend and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 44 years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	We also bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock during the year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	In August 2015, we repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured.
58492_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	We ended 2015 with over $400 million of our commercial paper program available.
58492_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	Net debt to net capital at year end was 34.5%, within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P86_S3	The calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital is presented on page 47.
58492_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Cash from operations decreased in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	Though earnings increased during the year, the benefit to operating cash flow was more than offset by foam litigation payments totaling $82 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	The decrease in 2014 (versus 2013) was primarily from higher accounts receivable associated with increased sales volume late in that year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	With the foam litigation settlements largely complete, we expect cash from operations to approximate $450 million in 2016.
58492_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	We continue to closely monitor our working capital levels, and ended 2015 with adjusted working capital at 9.5% of annualized sales 1 .
58492_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our performance related to operating efficiency and believe this provides a more useful measurement.
58492_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	The increase in adjusted working capital as a percent of annualized sales in 2015 primarily reflects decreased litigation accruals from payments made during the year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($945 million in 2015 and $953 million in 2014) multiplied by 4.
58492_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.
58492_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Three primary components of our working capital are discussed below.
58492_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Trade Receivables - The payment trends by our major customers remained stable in 2015, with slight improvements in full year bad debt expense compared to 2014 levels.
58492_16_ITEM7_P95_S1	We continue to look for ways to improve payment patterns of customers and offer programs with incentives for early payment offered in conjunction with third parties when appropriate.
58492_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	Trade Receivables decreased slightly in 2015, primarily due to price deflation and currency translation impacts.
58492_16_ITEM7_P97_S0	Total Inventories - The physical flow of materials through our production facilities is materially the same as in prior periods, and we are not experiencing a buildup of inventory.
58492_16_ITEM7_P97_S1	Expense associated with slow moving and obsolete inventories in 2015 was generally in line with that of 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P97_S2	Further, we review usage and inventory quantities at the part number level to determine if current inventory amounts are recoverable by future demand, and reserve necessary amounts on a timely basis.
58492_16_ITEM7_P98_S0	FIFO Inventory decreased in 2015 primarily due to significant steel-related price deflation and currency fluctuations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P98_S1	These decreases were partially offset by the timing of certain customer orders late in the year, opportunistic purchases of raw materials, and continued sales growth (which requires additional inventory for support).
58492_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	The increase in our fourth quarter DIO is directly related to the effects of the LIFO method of accounting for inventories and the significant deflation in steel prices during 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	Under LIFO accounting, the most recent raw material purchases are assumed to be the first consumed in production.
58492_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	Significant steel price deflation resulted in a significant decrease in our LIFO reserves, particularly in the fourth quarter, making comparability to prior quarter's DIO difficult.
58492_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	Our payment terms are materially consistent with our past practices.
58492_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	We strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors and third parties that allow flexible payment options.
58492_16_ITEM7_P101_S2	Our accounts payable balance decreased at December 31, 2015 vs. 2014 primarily due to steel deflation (that led to lower cost of raw material purchases), currency fluctuations, and timing of payments for inventory purchases.
58492_16_ITEM7_P101_S3	Steel deflation (which was particularly sharp in the fourth quarter), also drove a decrease in our fourth quarter 2015 DPO.
58492_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	The following table presents dollar amounts of key working capital components at the end of the past two years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	The next chart shows recent trends in key working capital components (expressed in numbers of days at the end of the past five quarters).
58492_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	The inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as: ending net inventory (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	The trade receivables ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as: ending net trade receivables (quarterly net sales number of days in the quarter).
58492_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	The accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as: ending accounts payable (quarterly cost of goods sold number of days in the quarter).
58492_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Cash is readily available to fund selective growth, both internally (through capital expenditures) and externally (through acquisitions).
58492_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	In certain of our businesses and product lines we have minimal excess capacity, and we are investing to support continued growth.
58492_16_ITEM7_P106_S1	In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production in 2016 and later years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P106_S2	In Bedding, we are investing in equipment (that we build in our own Swiss operation) to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore innersprings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P106_S3	In Adjustable Bed, which operated a single large location until 2015, we have added new locations to broaden our geographic scope and now operate four facilities in North America.
58492_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	In many of our other businesses, we have available capacity to accommodate additional volume.
58492_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	For each additional $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	With market share gains and higher market demand, our capacity utilization has increased.
58492_16_ITEM7_P107_S3	The earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, that higher utilization.
58492_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	We will continue to make investments to support growth in businesses and product lines where sales are strong, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance.
58492_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	We expect capital expenditures to approximate $130 million in 2016.
58492_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	Our incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital.
58492_16_ITEM7_P108_S3	This emphasis heightens the focus on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.
58492_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	Our strategic, long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our business units that have been designated as Grow businesses, and are looking for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	In 2013, we acquired two small businesses that supply tubing and tubing sub-assemblies to the aerospace market.
58492_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	In 2014, we purchased the three Tempur Sealy U.S. innerspring component production facilities for $45 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P111_S1	We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for residential furniture.
58492_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	In 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial, and other settings for $23 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	Additional details about these and other smaller acquisitions can be found in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 109.
58492_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	Increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_16_ITEM7_P114_S1	In 2015, we increased the quarterly dividend to $.32 per share and extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 44 years, at an average compound growth rate of 13%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P114_S2	Our targeted dividend payout ratio is approximately 50-60% of net earnings, however the actual payout has been higher in recent years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P114_S3	As a result, dividend growth in recent years has been modest, at about 3% per year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P114_S4	With significant earnings improvement in 2015, the dividend payout ratio for the year was within the target range.
58492_16_ITEM7_P114_S5	This should allow us flexibility to consider future dividend growth that more closely aligns with earnings growth.
58492_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	During 2012, we declared four quarterly dividends, but paid five, given our decision to accelerate into December 2012 the dividend typically paid in January 2013 (of $41 million) in anticipation of tax rate increases on individual taxpayers.
58492_16_ITEM7_P115_S1	In 2013, we returned to our prior practice and paid the fourth quarter dividend in January 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P115_S2	Therefore, the cash requirement for dividends in 2013 was lower, at $125 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	As shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in each of the last three years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P116_S1	During that time frame, we repurchased a total of 15.6 million shares of our stock and issued 9.1 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 5%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P116_S2	In 2015, we repurchased 4.3 million shares (at an average of $45.72) and issued 2.1 million shares (at an average of $23.61).
58492_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (via capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt or stockpile cash.
58492_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.
58492_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	___________________________________________ (1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_16_ITEM7_P119_S1	The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps.
58492_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	(2) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	The next table shows the percent of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2015 and 2014, calculated in two ways:
58492_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	Long-term debt and total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	Long-term debt and total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_16_ITEM7_P125_S1	We use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage.
58492_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) decreased $21 million in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	We repaid $200 million of 5.0% notes that matured in August 2015 and funded the payoff with a combination of cash and commercial paper.
58492_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $600 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $600 million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of 12 lenders.
58492_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	The credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the agreement, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_16_ITEM7_P127_S3	Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	The average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during 2015 was $136 million and $315 million, respectively.
58492_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $255 million and $289 million respectively.
58492_16_ITEM7_P128_S2	At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement, but we had $64 million of stand-by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing.
58492_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	With operating cash flows, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.
58492_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	Our revolving credit agreement and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants, with which we were comfortably in compliance as of December 31, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P130_S1	For more information, see Note J on page 91 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $253 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	A substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P132_S1	Though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs, we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the U.S. over a period of two to three years without material cost.
58492_16_ITEM7_P132_S2	However, due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $90 million of this cash is currently inaccessible for repatriation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P132_S3	Additionally, if we had to bring all of the foreign cash back immediately in the form of dividends, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to approximately $107 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P132_S4	In 2015, 2014, and 2013, we brought back cash of $112 million, $129 million, and $119 million, respectively, in each case at little to no added tax cost.
58492_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2015:
58492_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2015 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	Other obligations include our net reserves for tax contingencies in the "More Than 5 Years" column because these obligations are long-term in nature and actual payment dates can not be specifically determined.
58492_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	Other obligations also include our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension plans.
58492_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_16_ITEM7_P137_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_16_ITEM7_P137_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72.
58492_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	The Steel Tubing unit met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	Because fair value less cost to sell had fallen below recorded book value, we fully impaired this unit's goodwill and incurred a non-cash charge of $4 million in the first quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	In July 2014, we concluded that an impairment was required related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures group, which was formerly part of the Commercial Products segment and is now reported in discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P143_S1	A non-cash charge of $108 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2014 for the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business.
58492_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	In December 2013, we concluded that an impairment was required relating to the goodwill of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) group.
58492_16_ITEM7_P144_S1	A non-cash charge of $63 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.
58492_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	In order to assess goodwill for potential impairment, judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit (which is one level below reportable segments) using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	The second quarter 2015 goodwill impairment review indicated no impairments, with all reporting units having fair values that exceed carrying value by more than 50%.
58492_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	We have $806 million of goodwill at December 31, 2015, including $12 million associated with the CVP reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM7_P150_S1	As discussed in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79, we continue to explore strategic alternatives for this reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM7_P150_S2	If we are not able to meet projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible.
58492_16_ITEM7_P150_S3	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	Impairments were $2 million in 2015, $1 million in 2014 and $2 million in 2013.
58492_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	We value inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover).
58492_16_ITEM7_P158_S1	Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product.
58492_16_ITEM7_P158_S2	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e., not selling very quickly).
58492_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving.
58492_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	At December 31, 2015, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $33 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories).
58492_16_ITEM7_P162_S1	This is consistent with the December 31, 2014 and 2013 reserves of $30 million and $36 million, respectively, representing 6% of FIFO inventories.
58492_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	Additions to inventory reserves in 2015 were $10 million, which were comparable to the previous year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P163_S1	We do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels.
58492_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay (since we are self-insured).
58492_16_ITEM7_P165_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $9 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P166_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P166_S2	At December 31, 2015, we had accrued $35 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	Internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years and are expected to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future.
58492_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_16_ITEM7_P173_S0	The average annual amount of customer-related bad debt expense was $5 million (significantly less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P173_S1	At December 31, 2015, our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled $10 million (about 2% of our accounts and customer-related notes receivable of $459 million).
58492_16_ITEM7_P174_S0	We have not experienced any significant individual customer bankruptcies in the past three years.
58492_16_ITEM7_P174_S1	We believe the financial health of our major customers has modestly improved, but some are highly leveraged, and this could cause circumstances to change in the future.
58492_16_ITEM7_P175_S0	At December 31, 2015, we had less than $1 million of non-customer notes receivable.
58492_16_ITEM7_P176_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P177_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid, which also impacts current year pension expense.
58492_16_ITEM7_P178_S0	Determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities).
58492_16_ITEM7_P178_S1	Other assumptions include rates of compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates, and retirement ages.
58492_16_ITEM7_P178_S2	These estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.5 million and increases the plans benefit obligation by $9 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P179_S1	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.4 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_16_ITEM7_P181_S0	Mortality assumptions represent our best estimate of the duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date.
58492_16_ITEM7_P181_S1	These estimates are based on each plans' demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances.
58492_16_ITEM7_P181_S2	Longer life expectancies increased our pension liability for our most significant plans by approximately $20 million in 2014.
58492_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_16_ITEM7_P182_S1	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred, we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss.
58492_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our estimate of the likely cost.
58492_16_ITEM7_P183_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable.
58492_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.
58492_16_ITEM7_P184_S1	With the exception of 2014, our largest annual cost for litigation claims was $6 million for the five years ending December 31, 2015 (excluding legal fees).
58492_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	During 2014, we recorded expense of $92 million ($57 million for continuing operations and $35 million in discontinued operations) for various proceedings and other claims.
58492_16_ITEM7_P185_S1	By far the largest portion of these accruals was associated with a series of antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam as discussed in Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 114.
58492_16_ITEM7_P185_S2	During 2015, we settled the substantial majority of these cases.
58492_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_16_ITEM7_P186_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM7_P186_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_16_ITEM7_P186_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_16_ITEM7_P186_S4	If necessary, we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_16_ITEM7_P188_S0	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_16_ITEM7_P188_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $32 million and $34 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to net operating losses and other tax carryforwards.
58492_16_ITEM7_P188_S2	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_16_ITEM7_P188_S3	In cases where we believe it is more likely than not that we may not realize the future potential tax benefits, we establish a valuation allowance against them.
58492_16_ITEM7_P189_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_16_ITEM7_P189_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_16_ITEM7_P190_S0	Potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_16_ITEM7_P190_S1	If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed at current rates, we would incur additional taxes of approximately $107 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P191_S0	Audits by various taxing authorities continue as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_16_ITEM7_P191_S1	Based upon past audit experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_16_ITEM7_P192_S0	The likelihood of recovery of net operating losses and other tax carryforwards has been closely evaluated and is based upon such factors as the time remaining before expiration, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_16_ITEM7_P192_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_16_ITEM7_P192_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_16_ITEM7_P192_S3	Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense.
58492_16_ITEM7_P193_S0	Accruals for Probable Losses Although the Company denies liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, in millions, as follows:
58492_16_ITEM7_P194_S0	We expect to pay the majority of the accrual balance within the next year.
58492_16_ITEM7_P195_S0	The above litigation contingency accrual does not include accrued expenses related to workers' compensation, automobile, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense.
58492_16_ITEM7_P195_S1	However, any litigation expense associated with these categories are not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation, or cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM7_P195_S2	For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Footnote I - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information under "Accrued expenses" on page 90.
58492_16_ITEM7_P196_S0	We have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
58492_16_ITEM7_P196_S1	Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals Based upon current facts and circumstances, as of December 31, 2015, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $25 million.
58492_16_ITEM7_P196_S2	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current facts and circumstances, that additional losses, if any (other than approximately $14 million plus interest and attorney fees of approximately $2 million of reasonably possible losses associated with Brazilian VAT matters and approximately $9 million of reasonably possible losses primarily related to patent infringement, antitrust matters and other matters), are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM7_P196_S3	For more information regarding litigation contingencies, please refer to Note T on page 114 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
58492_16_ITEM7_P197_S0	As discussed in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72, the FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods.
58492_16_ITEM7_P197_S1	We are currently evaluating the newly issued guidance and the impact on our future financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The table below provides information about the Company s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The fair value of fixed rate debt was not materially different than its $950 carrying value at December 31, 2014, and greater than its $750 carrying value by $13.4 at December 31, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The increase in the fair market value of the Company s debt is primarily due to the maturity and repayment of $200 of notes in 2015, the increase in credit spreads as compared to the prior year end, increased interest rates, and the timing of interest payments.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2015 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Company s interest costs for its medium-term notes.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	These rates exclude the amortization of interest rate swap.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	It is the Company s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair value hedges is provided in Note S beginning on page 111 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long-term commitment, and does not hedge translation exposures.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The investment in a foreign subsidiary may take the form of either permanent capital or notes.
58492_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company s net investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to translation exposure) in foreign subsidiaries at December 31 is as follows:
58492_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes, Financial Statement Schedule and supplementary financial information included in this Report are listed and included in Item 15, and are incorporated by reference into this item.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation as of December 31, 2015, was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
58492_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2015, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting can be found on page 65, and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting can be found on page 66 of this Form 10-K. Each is incorporated by reference into this Item 9A.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the design to transition certain corporate-level shared service systems for general ledger, sales invoicing, cash application, accounts payable, purchasing and accounts payable disbursements to a new platform.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The new platform is expected to further automate and enhance a number of existing processes and activities primarily related to our domestic U.S. operations.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	We anticipate total capital outlay for this activity to be approximately $20 million over three years, and expect the majority of the systems to be transitioned during the last half of 2016 and the first half of 2017.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	These improvements are ongoing system processes and system enhancements and are not being made in response to any control deficiency or weakness.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting has been and, we expect, will continue to be, effective through this transition.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Implementation risk will be controlled through an on-going process of monitoring and evaluation to mitigate potential risk.
58492_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	The system deployments will include fully evaluating and updating our internal control over financial reporting, as well as significant testing and training.
58492_16_ITEM10_P0_S0	The subsections entitled Proposal 1 Election of Directors, Corporate Governance, Board and Committee Composition and Meetings, Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity, Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance and Director Independence in the Company s definitive Proxy Statement for the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 17, 2016, are incorporated by reference.
58492_16_ITEM10_P1_S0	Directors are normally elected annually at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until their successors are elected and qualified.
58492_16_ITEM10_P1_S1	Except for Richard T. Fisher, all current directors have been nominated for re-election at the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held May 17, 2016.

58492_16_ITEM10_P2_S0	In order to be nominated for election as a director, a nominee must submit a contingent resignation to the Nominating Corporate Governance Committee (N CG Committee).
58492_16_ITEM10_P2_S1	The resignation will become effective only if (i) the director nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in the director election; and (ii) the Board accepts the resignation.
58492_16_ITEM10_P2_S2	If a nominee fails to receive an affirmative majority of the votes cast in the director election, the N CG Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the director s resignation and whether any other action should be taken.
58492_16_ITEM10_P2_S3	If a director s resignation is not accepted, that director will continue to serve until the Company s next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.
58492_16_ITEM10_P2_S4	If the Board accepts the director s resignation, it may, in its sole discretion, either fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy.
58492_16_ITEM10_P2_S5	The Company s Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines set the director retirement age at 72; however, the Board Chair, the Lead Director, CEO or President may request a waiver for any director.
58492_16_ITEM10_P2_S6	At the request of Leggett s CEO, the N CG Committee recommended, and the full Board granted, a retirement age waiver for R. Ted Enloe, III so he may stand for re-election at the 2016 annual meeting.

58492_16_ITEM15_P3_S0	(b) Exhibits See Exhibit Index beginning on page 126.
58492_16_ITEM15_P4_S0	We did not file other long-term debt instruments because the total amount of securities authorized under all of these instruments does not exceed ten percent of the total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
58492_16_ITEM15_P4_S1	The Company agrees to furnish a copy of such instruments to the SEC upon request.
58492_16_ITEM15_P5_S0	Management of Leggett Platt, Incorporated is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
58492_16_ITEM15_P5_S1	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_16_ITEM15_P5_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
58492_16_ITEM15_P6_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett Platt assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_16_ITEM15_P8_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2015 , based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
58492_16_ITEM15_P8_S1	Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P9_S0	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2015 , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 66 of this Form 10-K.
58492_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Leggett Platt, Incorporated:
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S3	The Company s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
58492_16_ITEM15_P11_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	As discussed in Note N to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it classifies deferred income taxes in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
58492_16_ITEM15_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries ( we or our ).
58492_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States.
58492_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies.
58492_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Legal costs are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
58492_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs.
58492_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable.
58492_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	Legal fees are accrued when incurred.
58492_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	Other notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business.
58492_16_ITEM15_P26_S3	Other notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	Interest income is not recognized for nonperforming accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	Account balances are charged off against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
58492_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_16_ITEM15_P31_S2	The cost for approximately 50% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_16_ITEM15_P31_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_16_ITEM15_P31_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	We have had no material changes in inventory writedowns or slow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves in any of the years presented.
58492_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	The following table presents the activity in our LIFO reserve for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
58492_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:
58492_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08 "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity", beginning in 2015, a business is classified as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations or financial results, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, is disposed of by sale or otherwise.
58492_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	For 2014 and previous years, a business was classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business were clearly distinguished and were eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business was either disposed of or was classified as held for sale; and (iii) we did not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions.
58492_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_16_ITEM15_P38_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_16_ITEM15_P39_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell.
58492_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Property is reviewed for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	Our ten reporting units are the business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available.
58492_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	If the carrying value of the group exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that group.
58492_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a group exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of goodwill, it is necessary to estimate the fair values of the reporting units.
58492_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	In making this assessment, we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparable market values for similar entities using price-to-earnings ratios.
58492_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	Key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate, sales growth, margins, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital requirements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Recent performance of the group is an important factor, but not the only factor, in our assessment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_16_ITEM15_P58_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers.
58492_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities.
58492_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_16_ITEM15_P67_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute products for the various end markets described in Note F.
58492_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Europe, China, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.
58492_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_16_ITEM15_P69_S2	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of other notes receivable.
58492_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	Other notes receivable have historically primarily consisted of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business.
58492_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, natural gas purchases, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.
58492_16_ITEM15_P75_S2	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon reasonable estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency and commodities.
58492_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_16_ITEM15_P77_S3	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_16_ITEM15_P80_S2	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_16_ITEM15_P84_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years information in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to conform to the 2015 presentation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P85_S1	The first reclassification was a result of changes in our management organizational structure and related internal reporting (See Note F - Segment Information); the final was for a balance sheet reclassification between Machinery and Equipment and Goodwill associated with a measurement period adjustment related to an acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an ASU simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes.
58492_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	with any related valuation allowance, be presented as non-current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
58492_16_ITEM15_P87_S1	We adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2015, on a prospective basis and no prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.
58492_16_ITEM15_P87_S2	Adoption of this ASU resulted in the reclassification of all our current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities in our December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet.
58492_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	In 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which changes the presentation of such costs in the financial statements to a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as a separate asset.
58492_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	This guidance will be effective January 1, 2016, and is not expected to have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued new authoritative literature, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes much of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	This guidance will be effective January 1, 2018.
58492_16_ITEM15_P89_S2	We are evaluating the newly issued guidance and the impact on our future financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	The FASB has issued accounting guidance, in addition to the issuance discussed above, effective for current and future periods.
58492_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	This guidance did not have a material impact on our current financial statements, and we do not believe it will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	During 2015 and 2014, we exited the Store Fixtures business.
58492_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	Activity related to the exit was:
58492_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	During the third quarter of 2014, all of the criteria to classify this unit as held for sale and discontinued operations were met.
58492_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	Store Fixtures was previously part of the Commercial Products segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold the majority of the Store Fixtures reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	During 2015, we sold the remainder of the Store Fixtures operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	Total consideration for these businesses was approximately $72 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of these businesses.
58492_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	In 2013, we exited three small operations that were also recorded in discontinued operations:
58492_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	We closed our final location that produced wire dishwasher racks, thereby discontinuing that line of business.
58492_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	This operation was previously in our Industrial Materials segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	Tax benefits related to this business were recorded in both 2012 and 2013.
58492_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	We divested the specialty trailers portion of the Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	This branch was previously part of the Specialized Products segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business.
58492_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	We closed a cotton-based erosion control products operation that was previously part of the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P100_S1	Charges of $1.9 were recorded in 2013 to reflect estimates of fair value less costs to sell, including $1.5 of fixed asset impairments as discussed in Note C.
58492_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	The table below includes activity related to these operations:
58492_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	(2) Subsequent activity for businesses divested in prior years has been reported as discontinued operations in the table above, including an antitrust litigation settlement discussed in Note T of $.7 and $35.3 , in 2015 and 2014, respectively, associated with our former Prime Foam Products unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	This unit was sold in March 2007 and was previously part of the Residential Furnishings segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P103_S1	(3) The 2014 tax benefit is primarily related to the Store Fixtures goodwill impairment and the Prime Foam litigation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P103_S2	The 2013 tax amount includes benefits related to a worthless stock deduction of the subsidiary that produced wire dishwasher racks.
58492_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	Net assets held for sale by segment at December 31 were as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	The major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale at December 31 included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items noted below were as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	Current assets associated with discontinued operations:
58492_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	Non-current assets associated with discontinued operations:
58492_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	Current liabilities associated with discontinued operations:
58492_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	Long-term liabilities associated with discontinued operations:
58492_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	This represents property, plant and equipment held for sale associated with the closings of various operations and prior year restructurings.
58492_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we divested two small businesses that did not meet the discontinued operations criteria:
58492_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	Our Steel Tubing business, which reached held-for-sale status in the first quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P112_S1	The results for this operation (including $5.5 of impairment charges discussed in Note C and a pre-tax loss on sale of $3.2 ) are included in the Industrial Materials segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P112_S2	The pre-tax loss on sale is reported in "Other (income) expense, net" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P112_S3	External sales for this business were $88.9 , $94.3 , and $91.8 , and EBIT was $.2 , $(1.8) , and $(.2) , for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
58492_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	A small operation within our CVP business, which had not reached held-for-sale status prior to the sale.
58492_16_ITEM15_P113_S1	The results for this operation (including a pre-tax gain on sale of $1.3 ) are included in the Specialized Products segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P113_S2	The pre-tax gain on sale is reported in "Other (income) expense, net" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P113_S3	External sales for this business were $9.4 , $17.3 , and $19.0 , and EBIT was $(.5) , $(1.5) , and $(2.9) for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
58492_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.
58492_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	As discussed in Note A, we test other long-lived assets for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges noted above were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers or third party estimates of fair value less selling costs.
58492_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least once a year and as triggering events may occur.
58492_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year as discussed in Note A.
58492_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach.
58492_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	Each method is generally given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P119_S2	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_16_ITEM15_P119_S3	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P119_S4	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price-to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years.
58492_16_ITEM15_P120_S2	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a 25% control premium.
58492_16_ITEM15_P120_S3	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_16_ITEM15_P120_S4	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM15_P122_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10 -year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, sales growth, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	If a triggering event occurs, special consideration is given to the new circumstances when determining the fair value of the impacted reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	The 2015 goodwill impairment review indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	As discussed in Note F, our internal management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed during 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P126_S1	We reassigned the assets and liabilities of the reporting units affected, and also reassigned goodwill using a relative fair value approach.
58492_16_ITEM15_P126_S2	We performed the 2015 impairment test utilizing the revised structure.
58492_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	The Steel Tubing unit met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	Because fair value less costs to sell had fallen below recorded book value, we fully impaired this unit's goodwill and incurred a $4.1 goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	The fair values of reporting units in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in the second quarter 2015 review are presented in the table below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	After completing our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, we concluded on July 14, 2014 that a goodwill impairment charge was required for one reporting unit, Store Fixtures which was recorded as discontinued operations, and was previously part of the Commercial Products segment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	The Store Fixtures reporting unit was dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores.
58492_16_ITEM15_P130_S1	Because of the seasonal nature of the fixture and display industry (where revenue and profitability were typically expected to increase in the second and third quarters assuming the normal historical pattern of heavy shipments during these months) we reasonably anticipated being awarded significant customer orders in the second quarter of 2014.
58492_16_ITEM15_P130_S2	However, as the second quarter progressed, anticipated orders did not materialize and the Store Fixtures business deteriorated, with declines most pronounced in May and June.
58492_16_ITEM15_P130_S3	Taking these developments into account, we lowered our projection of future margins and growth rates (from 4.8% in prior year's review to .5% in the current year for 10-year compound annual growth rate for EBIT plus depreciation and amortization) and increased the discount rate from 10.5% to 12% , causing fair value to fall below carrying value.
58492_16_ITEM15_P130_S4	The lower expectations of future revenue and profitability were due to reduced overall market demand for store fixtures, as many retailers were reducing their investments in traditional store space and focusing more on e-commerce initiatives.
58492_16_ITEM15_P131_S0	This resulted in a $108.0 goodwill impairment charge that was recorded in the second quarter of 2014.
58492_16_ITEM15_P131_S1	This charge reflected the complete impairment of all goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures reporting unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P131_S2	The majority of the Store Fixtures business was divested in November 2014.
58492_16_ITEM15_P132_S0	As a result of the above circumstances, we also determined a triggering event had occurred in the second quarter to test other long-lived assets which were evaluated for impairment under the held for use model.
58492_16_ITEM15_P132_S1	No long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill) were indicated during this review.
58492_16_ITEM15_P132_S2	During the third quarter of 2014, all of the criteria to classify this unit as held for sale and discontinued operations were met as discussed in Note B.
58492_16_ITEM15_P133_S0	During 2013, we began considering strategic alternatives for our CVP unit, including possible divestiture of the business.
58492_16_ITEM15_P133_S1	Potential buyers' initial indications of value received during the second and third quarters were reasonably consistent with our fair value estimates used for the annual goodwill impairment test performed in June 2013.
58492_16_ITEM15_P134_S0	During 2013's fourth quarter, performance of the business deteriorated.
58492_16_ITEM15_P134_S1	It became apparent in December 2013 that current market values for CVP's assets had fallen below recorded book values.
58492_16_ITEM15_P134_S2	This decline in market values of the assets resulted from lower expectations of future revenue and profitability, reflecting reduced market demand for the racks, shelving, and cabinets used in telecom, cable and delivery vans.
58492_16_ITEM15_P135_S0	The events of the fourth quarter were considered a triggering event, which required us to perform an impairment review.
58492_16_ITEM15_P135_S1	Because the held for sale criteria for the CVP unit was not met, it was evaluated for impairment in December 2013 under the held for use model.
58492_16_ITEM15_P135_S2	No long-lived asset impairments (excluding goodwill) were indicated during the 2013 fourth quarter review.
58492_16_ITEM15_P135_S3	However, we also evaluated the remaining useful life for the intangible assets resulting in accelerated amortization of $3.8 in the fourth quarter of 2013 for selected CVP customer-related intangible assets.
58492_16_ITEM15_P136_S0	We determined fair value for the first step of the interim goodwill impairment test based upon market multiples of comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics as well as multiples derived from offers received during potential sale negotiations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P136_S1	These multiples were applied to lower profitability estimates, which was the result of CVP's 2013 fourth quarter business deterioration.
58492_16_ITEM15_P136_S2	Because fair value had fallen below recorded book values, we performed the second step of the test which requires a fair value assessment of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to calculate an implied goodwill amount, and a $63.0 goodwill impairment charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2013.
58492_16_ITEM15_P137_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we sold a small CVP operation as discussed in Note B, leaving two operations within that group.
58492_16_ITEM15_P137_S1	In February 2016, one of these operations reached held for sale status.
58492_16_ITEM15_P137_S2	We continue to review strategic alternatives for the remaining CVP operation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P138_S0	We have historically implemented various cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structures.
58492_16_ITEM15_P138_S1	These cost initiatives have, among other actions, included workforce reductions and the closure or consolidation of certain operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P138_S2	Our total restructuring-related costs for the three years ended December 31 were comprised of:
58492_16_ITEM15_P139_S0	Restructuring and restructuring-related charges (income) by segment were as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P140_S0	The accrued liability associated with our total restructuring initiatives consisted of the following:
58492_16_ITEM15_P141_S0	The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P142_S0	(1) As discussed in Note F, our internal management organization structure and all related internal reporting changed during 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P142_S1	We reassigned goodwill using a relative fair value approach and prior year amounts have been retrospectively adjusted.
58492_16_ITEM15_P142_S2	(2) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Store Fixtures unit as outlined in Note C. (3) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Steel Tubing unit as outlined in Note C.
58492_16_ITEM15_P143_S0	The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by major amortized intangible asset class and intangible assets acquired during the period presented included in "Other intangibles" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	Estimated amortization expense for items included in our December 31, 2015 balance sheet in each of the next five years is as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	We have four operating segments that supply a wide range of products:
58492_16_ITEM15_P146_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_16_ITEM15_P146_S1	Because of the November 2014 divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business unit (formerly in the Commercial Products segment) along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed during the first quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P146_S2	As a result, the composition of our four reportable segments changed to reflect the new structure beginning in the first quarter of 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P146_S3	The segment changes include: (i) the Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed business units moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products; (ii) the Aerospace Products business unit moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products; and (iii) the Spuhl machinery division moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings.
58492_16_ITEM15_P146_S4	Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials late in the year.
58492_16_ITEM15_P146_S5	These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.
58492_16_ITEM15_P147_S0	Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker.
58492_16_ITEM15_P147_S1	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P148_S0	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_16_ITEM15_P149_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory.
58492_16_ITEM15_P149_S1	Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements.

58492_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on assets and liabilities for each of the periods presented:
58492_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	When the tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit exceeds the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a windfall tax benefit is created.
58492_16_ITEM15_P187_S1	The windfall benefit is not recognized in income, but rather on the balance sheet as additional contributed capital.
58492_16_ITEM15_P188_S0	When the current tax deduction for an exercised stock option or converted stock unit is less than the deferred tax asset recorded in regard to the compensation cost that has been recognized in income, a tax shortfall is created.
58492_16_ITEM15_P188_S1	To the extent we have accumulated tax windfalls, the shortfall is recognized on the balance sheet as a reduction of additional contributed capital.
58492_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	We have granted stock options in the following areas:
58492_16_ITEM15_P190_S0	Starting in 2013, we discontinued the annual broad-based option grant, and replaced options with cash awards, RSU's, or, for certain key management employees, participation in the Profitable Growth Incentive (PGI).With the exception of a few key executive awards, options are now offered only in conjunction with the Deferred Compensation Program discussed below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P191_S0	Prior to 2013, we granted stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_16_ITEM15_P191_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months , 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_16_ITEM15_P191_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_16_ITEM15_P192_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are amortized by the straight-line method over the options total vesting period, except for employees who are retirement eligible.
58492_16_ITEM15_P193_S0	Expense for employees who are retirement eligible is recognized immediately.
58492_16_ITEM15_P194_S0	A person is retirement eligible if the employee is age 65 , or age 55 with 20 years of Company service.
58492_16_ITEM15_P195_S0	We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_16_ITEM15_P196_S0	Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_16_ITEM15_P196_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five , divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_16_ITEM15_P196_S2	The option has a 10 -year term.
58492_16_ITEM15_P196_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on each acquisition date and they vest immediately.
58492_16_ITEM15_P199_S0	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_16_ITEM15_P199_S1	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_16_ITEM15_P199_S2	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_16_ITEM15_P199_S3	Stock units are converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.
58492_16_ITEM15_P199_S4	However, stock units may be settled in cash at our discretion.
58492_16_ITEM15_P199_S5	Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.
58492_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note I.
58492_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	Stock option information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P202_S0	Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program.
58492_16_ITEM15_P202_S1	During 2015, there were no significant options exercised at a below market exercise price, and less than .1 of these options remain outstanding at December 31, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P203_S0	In 2005, we amended the Program to provide only at market stock options.
58492_16_ITEM15_P203_S1	A small amount of options related to this plan (less than .1 ) were outstanding at December 31, 2015.

58492_16_ITEM15_P205_S0	The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
58492_16_ITEM15_P206_S0	The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option.
58492_16_ITEM15_P207_S0	The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees.
58492_16_ITEM15_P207_S1	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility through the grant date, measured daily for a time period equal to the option s expected life.
58492_16_ITEM15_P207_S2	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_16_ITEM15_P208_S0	We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_16_ITEM15_P208_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_16_ITEM15_P209_S0	up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.
58492_16_ITEM15_P210_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_16_ITEM15_P210_S1	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions.
58492_16_ITEM15_P210_S2	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer matching accounts after three years of service.
58492_16_ITEM15_P211_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_16_ITEM15_P212_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_16_ITEM15_P212_S1	Participant contributions are credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we make premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_16_ITEM15_P212_S2	A participant s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_16_ITEM15_P212_S3	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units.
58492_16_ITEM15_P212_S4	The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company that will be settled in cash.
58492_16_ITEM15_P212_S5	Both the assets and liabilities associated with this program are presented in the table above and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P213_S0	We immediately match 50% of the employee contributions in the form of stock units.
58492_16_ITEM15_P213_S1	Company contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_16_ITEM15_P213_S2	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program and may be settled in cash at our discretion.
58492_16_ITEM15_P214_S0	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P214_S1	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.

58492_16_ITEM15_P217_S1	These awards contain the following conditions:
58492_16_ITEM15_P218_S0	Beginning Stock Price] as compared to the TSR of a group of peer companies.
58492_16_ITEM15_P219_S0	The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S P 500 and S P Midcap 400 (approximately 320 companies).
58492_16_ITEM15_P219_S1	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our TSR ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3 -year performance period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P220_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies.
58492_16_ITEM15_P220_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three -year vesting period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P221_S0	Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU s for the periods presented:
58492_16_ITEM15_P222_S0	We intend to pay out 65% of awards in shares of our common stock and 35% in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_16_ITEM15_P222_S1	The 35% portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P223_S0	RSU awards are generally granted as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P224_S0	The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P225_S0	Starting in 2013, certain key management employees participated in a new PGI program in lieu of the annual option grant.
58492_16_ITEM15_P226_S0	The PGI awards are issued as growth performance stock units (GPSUs).
58492_16_ITEM15_P226_S1	The GPSUs vest ( 0% to 250% ) at the end of a two -year performance period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P226_S2	Vesting is based on the Company's or applicable profit center's revenue growth (adjusted by a GDP factor when applicable) and EBITDA margin over a two -year performance period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P226_S3	The 2014 base target PGI award was .1 shares, 2015 was less than .1 shares.
58492_16_ITEM15_P226_S4	If earned, we intend to pay half in shares of our common stock and half in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.

58492_16_ITEM15_P230_S0	The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a net liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
58492_16_ITEM15_P230_S1	Our U.S. plans (comprised primarily of three significant plans) represent approximately 87% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.
58492_16_ITEM15_P230_S2	Participants in one of the significant domestic plans have stopped earning benefits; this plan is referred to as "frozen" in the following narrative.
58492_16_ITEM15_P231_S0	A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P232_S0	________________________ (1) The benefit obligation at December 31, 2015, decreased as compared to December 31, 2014, primarily due to the settlement of $35.7 of pension obligations through our voluntary one-time lump sum settlement program paid in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P232_S1	The benefit obligation at December 31, 2014, increased as compared to December 31, 2013, primarily due to changes in mortality assumptions and a decrease in the discount rate.
58492_16_ITEM15_P232_S2	Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below:
58492_16_ITEM15_P233_S0	Included in the above plans is a subsidiary s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.
58492_16_ITEM15_P233_S1	This is a non-qualified plan, and these benefits are secured by insurance policies that are not included in the plan s assets.
58492_16_ITEM15_P233_S2	Cash surrender values associated with these policies at December 31 were as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P234_S0	Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions are reflected below:
58492_16_ITEM15_P235_S0	Included in 2015 Amortization in the above table is the $12.1 settlement loss, which is discussed in more detail below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P236_S0	Of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2015, the portions expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in 2016 are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P237_S0	Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P238_S0	Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.
58492_16_ITEM15_P239_S0	We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points).
58492_16_ITEM15_P240_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P240_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_16_ITEM15_P241_S0	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P242_S0	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings, as discussed below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P243_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that separates fair value valuation techniques into the following categories:
58492_16_ITEM15_P244_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_16_ITEM15_P245_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_16_ITEM15_P246_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_16_ITEM15_P247_S0	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_16_ITEM15_P248_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities, as well as a stable value fund.
58492_16_ITEM15_P248_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P249_S0	Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_16_ITEM15_P249_S1	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P249_S2	In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_16_ITEM15_P249_S3	Approximately 55% of our significant plans (the "frozen plans") are employing a Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% fixed income and 40% equities.
58492_16_ITEM15_P249_S4	The remaining significant plans (the "active" plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% fixed income, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_16_ITEM15_P250_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to seven different investments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P251_S0	Six are mutual funds, all of which are passively managed low-cost index funds, and include:
58492_16_ITEM15_P252_S0	Total Stock Market Index: Large -, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_16_ITEM15_P253_S0	Large-Cap Index: Large-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_16_ITEM15_P254_S0	Small-Cap Index: Small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_16_ITEM15_P255_S0	World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world.
58492_16_ITEM15_P256_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market.
58492_16_ITEM15_P257_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to U.S. treasury's with maturities of 20-30 years.
58492_16_ITEM15_P258_S0	The Stable value fund consists of a fixed income portfolio offering consistent return and protection against interest rate volatility.
58492_16_ITEM15_P259_S0	In October 2015, we offered a voluntary one-time lump-sum payment option to certain eligible terminated vested participants in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans that, if accepted, would settle our obligation to them.
58492_16_ITEM15_P259_S1	The program provided participants with a one-time choice to receive a lump-sum settlement of their remaining pension benefit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P259_S2	As part of this voluntary lump-sum program, we settled $35.7 of pension obligations for U.S. retirees.
58492_16_ITEM15_P259_S3	This was paid from plan assets and did not require a cash contribution from the company.
58492_16_ITEM15_P259_S4	As a result of these settlements, we recorded settlement losses of $12.1 ( $7.5 net of tax) reflecting the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses in the plan proportionate to the obligation that was settled.
58492_16_ITEM15_P260_S0	We expect to contribute $1.8 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016.
58492_16_ITEM15_P261_S0	Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P262_S0	Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P263_S0	We have limited participation in two union-sponsored, defined benefit, multi-employer pension plans.
58492_16_ITEM15_P263_S1	These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_16_ITEM15_P263_S2	Aggregate contributions to these plans were less than $.8 for each of the years presented.
58492_16_ITEM15_P264_S0	In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if a plan has unfunded vested benefits.
58492_16_ITEM15_P264_S1	Factors that could impact the funded status of these plans include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.
58492_16_ITEM15_P264_S2	Withdrawal liability triggers could include a plan's termination, a withdrawal of substantially all employers, or our voluntary withdrawal from the plan (such as decision to close a facility or the dissolution of a collective bargaining unit).
58492_16_ITEM15_P264_S3	We have a very small share of the liability among the participants of these plans.
58492_16_ITEM15_P264_S4	Based upon the information available from plan administrators, both of the multi-employer plans in which we participate are underfunded and estimate our aggregate share of potential withdrawal liability for both plans to be $23.1 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P264_S5	We have not recorded any material withdrawal liabilities for the years presented.
58492_16_ITEM15_P265_S0	The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P266_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
58492_16_ITEM15_P267_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P268_S0	For all periods presented, the tax rate benefited from income earned in various foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily related to China and Luxembourg.
58492_16_ITEM15_P268_S1	Significant items impacting each year's tax rate are:
58492_16_ITEM15_P269_S0	2015: We recognized tax benefits totaling $11.3 , including a reduction in deferred taxes on undistributed foreign earnings associated with a planned reinvestment in China, and a deferred tax benefit related to our Australian operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P270_S0	We recognized tax benefits totaling $13.9 , primarily related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deductions for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable provision-to-return adjustments related to prior year taxes.
58492_16_ITEM15_P271_S0	We recognized tax benefits totaling $17.5 , primarily related to the impact of Mexico tax law changes, the settlement of certain foreign and state audits, and a non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_16_ITEM15_P272_S0	We recognized net excess tax benefits of approximately $15.4 , $10.1 , and $4.6 , in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, related to stock plan activity, which have been recorded to additional contributed capital.
58492_16_ITEM15_P272_S1	These amounts include net windfall tax benefits as discussed in Note L.
58492_16_ITEM15_P273_S0	We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_16_ITEM15_P273_S1	In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_16_ITEM15_P273_S2	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities can no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_16_ITEM15_P273_S3	In addition, once the statute expires we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_16_ITEM15_P274_S0	The total amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015, is $22.1 , of which $12.8 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_16_ITEM15_P274_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P275_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_16_ITEM15_P276_S0	As of December 31, 2015, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2012 through 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P276_S1	In 2015, the IRS examined our 2013 tax return for a U.S. non-consolidated filing entity, L P Financial Services Co., and the audit was concluded with no adjustments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P276_S2	There are no current IRS examinations in process nor are we aware of any forthcoming.
58492_16_ITEM15_P277_S0	Additionally, at December 31, 2015, eight tax years were either subject to or undergoing audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2008 through 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P277_S1	The examinations in process are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any likely material adjustments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P277_S2	The Canada Revenue Agency did issue an assessment in 2014 with respect to the 2007 and 2008 years in the amount of $2.9 , related to transfer pricing issues.
58492_16_ITEM15_P277_S3	We disagree with the findings and continue to appeal this assessment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P278_S0	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years also remain open to examination, though we believe any assessments would be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P279_S0	It is reasonably possible that resolution of certain tax audits could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, as certain tax positions may be sustained on audit, or we may agree to certain adjustments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P279_S1	It is not expected that any change would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P280_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_16_ITEM15_P280_S1	The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P281_S0	Significant fluctuations in our deferred taxes from 2014 to 2015 are:
58492_16_ITEM15_P282_S0	The net deferred tax asset associated with property, plant, and equipment decreased in 2015 due primarily to the anticipated utilization of Canadian capital cost allowances on our Canadian tax return filing.
58492_16_ITEM15_P283_S0	The increase in our net inventory deferred tax liability is primarily related to changes in our LIFO inventory assumptions associated with 2015 steel prices.
58492_16_ITEM15_P284_S0	A significant portion of the net decrease in accrued expenses relates to 2015 payments of $82 associated with our foam antitrust litigation accrual.
58492_16_ITEM15_P285_S0	The net increase in our deferred tax liability for intangible assets results from various acquisitions and divestitures in 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P286_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss, tax credit, and capital loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_16_ITEM15_P286_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_16_ITEM15_P286_S2	Individually, none of these tax carryforwards presents a material exposure.
58492_16_ITEM15_P287_S0	These tax carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, with no amount greater than $10 expiring in any one year.
58492_16_ITEM15_P288_S0	Deferred income and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_16_ITEM15_P289_S0	The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.
58492_16_ITEM15_P290_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have accrued $6.9 and $11.2 , respectively, of deferred taxes related to incremental withholding taxes in China, since we no longer have specific plans to reinvest all of our Chinese earnings within China.
58492_16_ITEM15_P290_S1	In 2015, we reduced these accrued taxes by a net $4.3 , primarily due to a planned reinvestment related to the buy-out of a minority interest partner at one of our China subsidiaries.
58492_16_ITEM15_P290_S2	Although these taxes would be due on dividends from certain of our China subsidiaries to their foreign parent, a subsidiary of the U.S. company, the earnings are still permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and are included in the undistributed earnings and incremental taxes discussed below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P291_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested.
58492_16_ITEM15_P291_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings which are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2015, are $616.2 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P291_S2	If such earnings were distributed, we estimate that the resulting incremental tax expense would be approximately $106.9 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.
58492_16_ITEM15_P291_S3	In 2015, the foreign earnings we repatriated were immaterial, and resulted in no significant net tax benefit or cost.
58492_16_ITEM15_P292_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P293_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , simplifying the presentation of deferred income taxes.
58492_16_ITEM15_P293_S1	This ASU requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be presented as non-current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
58492_16_ITEM15_P293_S2	We adopted this guidance as of December 31, 2015, on a prospective basis, and no prior periods were retrospectively adjusted.
58492_16_ITEM15_P293_S3	Adoption of this ASU resulted in the reclassification of all our current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current deferred tax assets and liabilities in our December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet.
58492_16_ITEM15_P294_S0	The components of other (income) expense from continuing operations were as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P295_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_16_ITEM15_P296_S0	We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_16_ITEM15_P297_S0	The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P298_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_16_ITEM15_P299_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_16_ITEM15_P300_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_16_ITEM15_P300_S1	Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_16_ITEM15_P300_S2	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_16_ITEM15_P300_S3	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_16_ITEM15_P300_S4	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_16_ITEM15_P301_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_16_ITEM15_P302_S0	______________________________________________ * Includes both current and long-term amounts combined.
58492_16_ITEM15_P303_S0	The fair value for fixed rate debt (Level 2) was not significantly different from its $950.0 carrying value at December 31, 2014 and greater than its $750.0 carrying value by approximately $13 at December 31, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P303_S1	We value this debt using discounted cash flow and secondary market rates provided by Bloomberg.
58492_16_ITEM15_P304_S0	goodwill) for potential impairment as discussed in Note C. Determining fair values for these items requires significant judgment and includes a variety of methods and models that utilize significant Level 3 inputs.
58492_16_ITEM15_P305_S0	Long-lived assets, acquisitions and the second step of a goodwill impairment test utilize the following methodologies in determining fair value: (i) Buildings and machinery are valued at an estimated replacement cost for an asset of comparable age and condition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P305_S1	Market pricing of comparable assets are used to estimate replacement cost where available.
58492_16_ITEM15_P306_S0	The most common identified intangible assets are customer relationships and tradenames.
58492_16_ITEM15_P306_S1	Customer relationships are valued using an excess earnings method, using various inputs such as the estimated customer attrition rate, future earnings forecast, the amount of contributory asset charges, and a discount rate.
58492_16_ITEM15_P306_S2	Tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty method, which is based upon comparable market royalty rates for tradenames of similar value.
58492_16_ITEM15_P307_S0	(iii) Inventory is valued at current replacement cost for raw materials, with a step-up for work in process and finished goods items that reflects the amount of ultimate profit earned as of the valuation date.
58492_16_ITEM15_P307_S1	(iv) Other working capital items are generally recorded at face value, unless there are known conditions that would impact the ultimate settlement amount of the particular item.
58492_16_ITEM15_P308_S0	The following table contains the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions.
58492_16_ITEM15_P308_S1	A portion of the goodwill included in the table below is expected to provide an income tax benefit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P309_S0	The following table summarizes acquisitions for the periods presented.
58492_16_ITEM15_P310_S0	We are finalizing all of the information required to complete the purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_16_ITEM15_P311_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P311_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2015 and 2014 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P312_S0	Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash at a later date and are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date.
58492_16_ITEM15_P312_S1	At December 31, 2015, there was no substantial remaining consideration payable, other than the liability associated with our 2015 acquisition discussed below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P313_S0	A brief description of our most significant acquisitions by year is included below.
58492_16_ITEM15_P314_S0	In March 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for office, commercial and other settings for a purchase price of $22.7 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P314_S1	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_16_ITEM15_P314_S2	We will acquire the remaining 30% over the next five years, under the terms of the agreement, and have recorded a long-term liability of approximately $10 for the future payments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P315_S0	Future payments are based upon a calculation that incorporates future EBITDA.
58492_16_ITEM15_P315_S1	The recorded liability is based upon estimates and may fluctuate significantly until the 2018 and 2020 payment dates.
58492_16_ITEM15_P315_S2	Fluctuations in this liability will be reflected in interest income or expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P316_S0	On June 30, we acquired Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring component production facilities for a purchase price of $44.5 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P316_S1	This additional volume enhanced our economies of scale, benefited from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire, and allowed manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base.
58492_16_ITEM15_P316_S2	These factors contributed to the recognition of $17.8 in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P317_S0	We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components for a purchase price of $16.8 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P317_S1	This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products, which contributed to the recognition of $4.4 in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P318_S0	We expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies.
58492_16_ITEM15_P319_S0	The first was a UK-based business that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication.
58492_16_ITEM15_P319_S1	This business was acquired for a purchase price of $11.7 , and $6.1 of goodwill was recorded related to this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P319_S2	Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill included its international presence and complimentary fit with our Aerospace Products business unit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P320_S0	The second was a French company that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio for a cash purchase price of $14.5 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P320_S1	This business was acquired at a price less than fair value of the net identifiable assets, and we recorded an $8.8 non-taxable bargain purchase gain.
58492_16_ITEM15_P320_S2	The bargain purchase gain is reported in the "Other (income) expense, net" line of our income statement.
58492_16_ITEM15_P321_S0	Prior to recognizing a bargain purchase gain, we reassessed whether all assets acquired and liabilities assumed had been correctly identified, the key valuation assumptions and business combination accounting procedures for this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P321_S1	After careful consideration and review, we concluded that the recognition of a bargain purchase gain was appropriate for this acquisition.
58492_16_ITEM15_P321_S2	Factors that contributed to the bargain purchase price were:
58492_16_ITEM15_P322_S0	The transaction was completed with a motivated seller that desired to restructure its operations in order to focus on its core competencies and exit in an expedient manner non-core businesses that no longer fit its strategy.
58492_16_ITEM15_P323_S0	We were able to complete the acquisition in an expedient manner, with a cash payment and without a financial contingency, which was a key attribute for the seller.
58492_16_ITEM15_P323_S1	The relatively small size of the transaction for us, the lack of required third-party financing and our expertise in completing similar transactions in the past gave the seller confidence that we could complete the transaction quickly and without difficulty.
58492_16_ITEM15_P324_S0	Because the seller of this business will continue to purchase these products in the future it was important to the seller that the acquiring company was a financially sound, integrated manufacturer that could provide a stable supply of high quality product for many years into the future.
58492_16_ITEM15_P324_S1	Due to the unique nature of the products and limited number of potential buyers for this business, the seller found it advantageous to accept our purchase price based upon our demonstrated ability to operate similar businesses, and financial strength that will enable us to be a long-term supplier of quality products into the future.
58492_16_ITEM15_P325_S0	We are subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates, foreign currency, and commodities.
58492_16_ITEM15_P325_S1	In the normal course of business, we utilize derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to manage these risks.
58492_16_ITEM15_P325_S2	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P325_S3	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_16_ITEM15_P326_S0	Derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P327_S0	Commodity Cash Flow Hedges We have historically used commodity cash flow hedges primarily to manage natural gas commodity price risk.
58492_16_ITEM15_P327_S1	Our last natural gas commodity hedge expired during 2013.
58492_16_ITEM15_P328_S0	Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges On August 12, 2012, we issued $300 of 10 -year notes with a coupon rate of 3.40% .
58492_16_ITEM15_P328_S1	As a part of this transaction, we settled our $200 forward starting interest rate swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of $42.7 , which will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense over the life of the notes.
58492_16_ITEM15_P328_S2	In anticipation of the issuance of new debt, we entered into a treasury lock agreement in October 2014.
58492_16_ITEM15_P328_S3	The treasury lock managed benchmark treasury interest rate risk associated with $50 of the additional $300 debt issued in November 2014 and was therefore settled on that same date.
58492_16_ITEM15_P328_S4	The treasury lock had an interest rate of 2.36% .
58492_16_ITEM15_P329_S0	The settlement of the treasury lock did not result in a material gain or loss.
58492_16_ITEM15_P330_S0	The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_16_ITEM15_P331_S0	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted.
58492_16_ITEM15_P332_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_16_ITEM15_P333_S0	Our fair value hedges typically manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries assets and liabilities.

58492_16_ITEM15_P369_S2	L P Brazil argued the payments were not required to be made because of the application of certain tax credits that were generated by L P Brazil's use of a correct tariff code for the classification of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings (i.e., the same underlying issue at stake in the other Brazilian matters).

58492_16_ITEM15_P370_S3	On September 4, 2014, the Brazilian Federal Revenue issued an assessment against L P Brazil in the amount of $.1 , No. 10660.722021/2014-73 for the period of April 2011 through June 2012, as a penalty for L P Brazil s requests to offset certain tax credits.
58492_16_ITEM15_P370_S4	On December 22, 2015, we received a favorable decision at the first administrative level, accepting our defense and canceling the imposed penalty.
58492_16_ITEM15_P370_S5	Because there is no further appeal opportunities, this assessment is now fully resolved.
58492_16_ITEM15_P371_S0	On December 15, 2015, the Brazilian Federal Revenue issued an assessment against L P Brazil in the amount of $.1 , No. 10600.720142/2015-76 for the period of August 2010 through May 2011, as a penalty for L P Brazil s requests to offset certain tax credits.
58492_16_ITEM15_P371_S1	We filed our defense on January 8, 2016.
58492_16_ITEM15_P371_S2	State of S o Paulo, Brazil Cases.
58492_16_ITEM15_P372_S0	L P Brazil is party to a proceeding involving the State of S o Paulo, Brazil where the State of S o Paulo, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil seeking $1.4 for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n .04-256.169/2009).
58492_16_ITEM15_P372_S1	The State of S o Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of S o Paulo.
58492_16_ITEM15_P372_S2	Paulo ruled in favor of L P Brazil nullifying the tax assessment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P372_S3	The State filed a special appeal and the Special Appeals Court remanded the case back to the Court of Tax and Fees for further findings.
58492_16_ITEM15_P372_S4	The Court of Tax and Fees again ruled in favor of L P Brazil and nullified the tax assessment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P373_S0	The State filed another special appeal.
58492_16_ITEM15_P373_S1	On April 17, 2014, the Court of Tax and Fees ruled in the State's favor upholding the original assessment of $1.4 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P374_S0	On July 31, 2014, L P Brazil filed an annulment action, Case No. 101712346.2014.8260602 in the Sorocaba State Court, seeking to have the Court of Tax and Fees ruling annulled for an updated assessment amount of $2.9 (which included interest from the original assessment date plus state attorney's fees of 20% ).
58492_16_ITEM15_P374_S1	This duplicative case was dismissed on August 14, 2015, while the annulment action continues.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S0	On October 4, 2012, the State of S o Paulo issued a Tax Assessment under Procedure Number 4.003.484 against L P Brazil in the amount of $1.2 for the tax years 2009 through 2011.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S1	Similar to the 2009 assessment, the State of S o Paulo argues that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of S o Paulo.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S2	On June 21, 2013, the State of S o Paulo's attorneys converted the Tax Assessment No. 4.003.484 to a tax collection action against L P Brazil in the amount of $1.5 , under Sorocaba Judicial District Court, Case No. 3005528-50.2013.8.26.0602.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S3	L P Brazil filed its response, a Motion to Stay of Execution denying the allegations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S4	L P Brazil also received a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of a Fine from the State of S o Paulo dated March 27, 2014, under Procedure Number 4.038.746-0 against L P Brazil in the amount of $0.7 for the tax years January 2011 through August 2012 regarding the same subject matter.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S5	L P filed its response denying the allegations.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S6	The first administrative level denied L P Brazil s defense and upheld the assessment.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S7	L P Brazil filed its appeal of this decision but the appeal was denied by the second administrative level on July 15, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P375_S8	L P Brazil filed an appeal to the third administrative level on August 6, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P376_S0	State of Minas Gerais, Brazil Cases.
58492_16_ITEM15_P376_S1	On December 18, 2012, the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil issued a tax assessment to L P Brazil relating to L P Brazil's classifications of innersprings for the collection and payment of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings in Minas Gerais from March 1, 2008 through August 31, 2012 in the amount of $.4 , under PTA Case No. 01.000.182756-62.
58492_16_ITEM15_P376_S2	L P Brazil filed its response denying any violation.
58492_16_ITEM15_P377_S0	The first administrative level ruled against us.
58492_16_ITEM15_P377_S1	We appealed to the second administrative level, which affirmed the first administrative level ruling.
58492_16_ITEM15_P377_S2	The case is now proceeding judicially under Case No. 0003673-61.2014.8.13.0878 in Camanducaia Judicial District Court.
58492_16_ITEM15_P377_S3	L P Brazil filed its response, a Motion to Stay of Execution, on June 5, 2014.
58492_16_ITEM15_P378_S0	Patent Infringement Claim The patent proceedings discussed below have been fully resolved.
58492_16_ITEM15_P378_S1	The outcome of these matters did not have a material effect on the Company, its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM15_P379_S0	On January 24, 2012, in a case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the jury entered a verdict against us in the amount of $5 based upon an allegation by plaintiff that we infringed three patents on an automatic stapling machine and on methods used to assemble boxsprings.
58492_16_ITEM15_P379_S1	This action was originally filed on October 4, 2010, as case number CV10-7416 RGK (SSx) under the caption Imaginal Systematic, LLC v. Leggett Platt, Incorporated; Simmons Bedding Company; and Does 1 through 10, inclusive.
58492_16_ITEM15_P379_S2	Leggett is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Simmons Bedding Company against a claim for infringement.
58492_16_ITEM15_P379_S3	On summary judgment motions, we unsuccessfully disputed each patent s validity and denied that we infringed any patent.
58492_16_ITEM15_P380_S0	At the jury trial on damages issues, the plaintiff alleged damages of $16.2 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P380_S1	The court denied plaintiff s attempt to win an attorney fee award and triple the pre-verdict damages.
58492_16_ITEM15_P380_S2	We appealed the case to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S0	Oral argument was held before a three judge appeal panel in the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S1	The Court of Appeals issued a judgment affirming the $5 verdict against us, which was fully accrued for in the first quarter of 2013 and then paid in the second quarter of 2013.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S2	We filed a petition for a rehearing of the Court of Appeals decision which was denied.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S3	We also filed re-examination proceedings in the Patent Office (Case Nos. 95/001,543 filed February 11, 2011; 95/001,546 and 95/001,547 filed February 16, 2011), challenging the validity of each patent at issue in the lawsuit the plaintiff brought.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S4	The Patent Office examiner ruled in our favor on the key claims of one of the three patents.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S5	The Patent Office examiner initially ruled in our favor on the pertinent claims of the second of the patents, but subsequently reversed that decision.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S6	With respect to the third patent, the Patent Office examiner's decision upheld the validity of all claims.
58492_16_ITEM15_P381_S7	All three of these proceedings were appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals.
58492_16_ITEM15_P382_S0	The plaintiff filed petitions to terminate all re-examination proceedings based on the final ruling of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_16_ITEM15_P383_S0	The Patent Office terminated all three re-examination proceedings, and we requested an ex parte re-examination as to one of the patents.
58492_16_ITEM15_P383_S1	The Patent Office did not accept our request.
58492_16_ITEM15_P383_S2	The plaintiff requested royalties for post-verdict use of the machines, and requested pre-judgment interest in the amount of $.7 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P383_S3	The District Court ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to additional ongoing royalties for our continued use of the machines, but did award pre-judgment interest of $.5 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P383_S4	Both parties filed a notice of appeal of this order to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, but plaintiff later withdrew its appeal.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S0	On July 29, 2013, the plaintiff filed a second lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S1	CV13-05463 alleging that we and Simmons Bedding Company have continued to infringe the three patents on an automatic stapling machine and the methods used to assemble boxsprings, and that the plaintiff is entitled to additional damages from January 24, 2012 forward.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S2	Leggett and Simmons Bedding Company filed their answers, and the Court granted summary judgment finding that the use of an earlier version of the automatic stapling machines constituted infringement, but also finding that use of a redesigned version of the machine does not infringe any Imaginal patent.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S3	On October 17, 2014, the parties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Limited Release, whereby Leggett agreed to pay Imaginal a cash payment, which is not material to the Company, to settle the part of the case concerning the machines found to infringe and the pre-judgment interest issue from the first lawsuit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S4	Imaginal appealed the summary judgment ruling that the redesigned stapling machines did not infringe to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S5	On November 10, 2015 the Federal Circuit upheld the favorable decision that the Company s redesigned version of the machine did not infringe the Imaginal patent.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S6	Imaginal did not seek rehearing, nor did it seek a petition for certiorari review at the United States Supreme Court.
58492_16_ITEM15_P384_S7	As such, this lawsuit has been fully resolved.
58492_16_ITEM15_P385_S0	Accruals and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals Accruals for Probable Losses Although the Company denies liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, as follows:
58492_16_ITEM15_P386_S0	We expect to pay the majority of the accrual balance within the next year.
58492_16_ITEM15_P387_S0	The above litigation contingency accrual does not include accrued expenses related to worker's compensation, automobile, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense.
58492_16_ITEM15_P387_S1	However, any litigation expense associated with these categories are not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM15_P387_S2	For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Footnote I - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information under "Accrued expenses" on page 90.
58492_16_ITEM15_P388_S0	We have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
58492_16_ITEM15_P388_S1	Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals Based upon current facts and circumstances, as of December 31, 2015, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $25 .
58492_16_ITEM15_P388_S2	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current facts and circumstances, that additional losses, if any (other than approximately $14 plus interest and attorney fees of approximately $2 of reasonably possible losses associated with those Brazilian VAT matters disclosed above and approximately $9 of reasonably possible losses primarily related to patent infringement, antitrust and other matters) are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_16_ITEM15_P389_S0	Leggett's Claim for Alleged Antitrust Violations On October 17, 2008, the Company, along with Carpenter Co., Flexible Foam Products, Inc., Foam Supplies, Inc., Hickory Springs Manufacturing Company, J.M. Huber Corporation, Lubrizol Advanced Materials, Inc., The Sherwin-Williams Company, Skypark Manufacturing, LLC, Vitafoam Incorporated; and their respective affiliates, as plaintiffs, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under the caption Carpenter Co., et al. v. BASF SE, et al., Case No. 2:08-cv-05169 against BASF Corporation, The Dow Chemical Company, Huntsman International LLC, Lyondell Chemical Company, and their affiliates, alleging that defendants conspired to fix prices and allocate customers and markets for certain urethane chemical products.
58492_16_ITEM15_P389_S1	The Company previously settled its claims against certain defendants for immaterial amounts and all other defendants have been dismissed except for The Dow Chemical Company.
58492_16_ITEM15_P390_S0	We, along with co-plaintiffs, seek to recover three times the amount of damages suffered as a result of the alleged overcharges in the price of the urethane chemical products purchased from the defendant from at least 1994 through at least 2004.
58492_16_ITEM15_P390_S1	The plaintiffs also seek attorney fees, pre-judgment interest and injunctive relief.
58492_16_ITEM15_P391_S0	Based on the maturation of the proceeding, discovery becoming substantially complete, and the scheduled trial date of March 7, 2016, we now believe that it is reasonably likely that we may recover material damages from the defendant.
58492_16_ITEM15_P391_S1	However, because of uncertainties, we cannot estimate the amount of recovery.
58492_16_ITEM15_P391_S2	Also, because of these uncertainties, it is possible that we may recover only an immaterial amount of the alleged damages, or recover no damages at all.
58492_16_ITEM15_P392_S0	__________________________________ All below amounts are shown pretax.

58492_16_ITEM15_P400_S0	Except as noted below, the named executive officers are expected to be eligible to receive a cash bonus under the Company s 2014 Key Officers Incentive Plan (filed March 25, 2014 as Appendix A to the Company s Proxy Statement) (the Plan ) in accordance with the 2016 award formula (which is expected to be adopted at the Committee s March 2016 meeting and, consistent with past years, is expected to include performance targets related to the achievement of Return on Capital Employed (60% relative weight), Cash Flow for Corporate Participants and Free Cash Flow for Profit Center Participants (20% relative weight) and certain Individual Performance Goals (20% relative weight)).
58492_16_ITEM15_P400_S1	Each executive s award is expected to be calculated by multiplying his annual salary at the end of the Plan year by his Target Percentage, then applying the award formula adopted by the Committee for that Plan year.
58492_16_ITEM15_P400_S2	We will disclose the 2016 award formula in a subsequent Form 8-K filing once it is adopted.
58492_16_ITEM15_P400_S3	The Target Percentages in 2014, 2015 and 2016 for Karl G. Glassman, and the Target Percentages in 2014 and 2015 for our principal financial officer and the other named executive officers are shown in the following table.
58492_16_ITEM15_P401_S0	Davis S. Haffner served as the Company s Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer through December 31, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P401_S1	His Target Percentage was 115% in each of 2014 and 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P401_S2	Pursuant to Mr. Haffner's former employment agreement with the Company, he will continue to receive a cash bonus payment with a Target percentage of 115% for all of 2016 and through the 2017 Annual Shareholders Meeting, which is expected to be held in May.
58492_16_ITEM15_P401_S3	Mr. Haffner s award formula is expected to be adopted at the March Committee meeting, and is expected to measure the achievement of Return on Capital Employed (70% relative weight) and Cash Flow (30% relative weight).
58492_16_ITEM15_P402_S0	Joseph D. Downes, Jr., the Company s former SVP, President Industrial Materials retired from the Company on December 31, 2015.
58492_16_ITEM15_P402_S1	He served in a lesser position with the Company from April 6, 2015 through December 31, 2015, and, as a result, in 2015, he participated in the Company s Key Management Incentive Compensation Plan, which is a cash bonus plan for non-executive officers.
58492_16_ITEM15_P402_S2	The award payout under this plan was determined in substantially the same manner as the 2014 Key Officers Incentive Plan and the 2015 award formula.
58492_16_ITEM15_P402_S3	The performance objectives were Return on Capital Employed (70% relative weight) and Free Cash Flow (30% relative weight) increased by as much as 5% for exceptional safety performance or decreased by as much as 20% for critical compliance failures.
58492_16_ITEM15_P403_S0	Karl G. Glassman became the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2016, and as previously reported, the Committee increased his Target Percentage from 90% to 115% at its January 4, 2016 meeting.
58492_16_ITEM15_P404_S0	The 2016 target percentages for Matthew C. Flanigan and Perry E. Davis are expected to be set by the Committee at its March 2016 meeting.
58492_16_ITEM15_P405_S0	Each executive s cash award under the award formula is based, in part, on individual performance goals established outside the Plan (20% relative weight).
58492_16_ITEM15_P405_S1	The 2016 goals for our named executive officers 1 are: Karl G. Glassman : Strategic planning, growth initiatives and succession planning.
58492_16_ITEM15_P405_S2	Matthew C. Flanigan : Strategic planning, credit facility renewal, information technology and internal audit improvements.
58492_16_ITEM15_P405_S3	Perry E. Davis : Growth of targeted businesses and supply chain initiatives.
58492_16_ITEM15_P406_S0	Neither Mr. Haffner nor Mr. Downes were employed by the Company as of January 1, 2016.
58492_16_ITEM15_P406_S1	As such, neither have individual performance goals for 2016.
58492_16_ITEM15_P407_S0	The achievement of the individual performance goals is measured by the following schedule.
58492_16_ITEM15_P408_S0	The following summary sets forth current annual rates of cash and equity compensation for non-management directors, effective immediately following the May 5, 2015 Board meeting, (subject to the revision for the Independent Board Chair as reflected below).
58492_16_ITEM15_P409_S0	R. Ted Enloe, III was elected Independent Board Chair effective January 1, 2016 to serve until the Annual Shareholder Meeting in May 2016.
58492_16_ITEM15_P409_S1	Mr. Enloe replaced David S. Haffner as Board Chair.
58492_16_ITEM15_P409_S2	Mr. Haffner previously served the Company as Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer.
58492_16_ITEM15_P409_S3	Mr. Enloe received a grant of 1,149 shares of restricted stock on January 4, 2016, which represented the pro-rata increase in equity compensation from January 1, 2016 to the anticipated Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 17, 2016 for his service as Independent Board Chair.
58492_16_ITEM15_P409_S4	The restricted stock award is expected to vest the day before the Annual Shareholder Meeting.
58492_16_ITEM15_P410_S0	Directors may defer their cash compensation by participating in the Company s Deferred Compensation Program, effective as of December 1, 2011 (filed February 24, 2012 as Exhibit 10.13 to the Company s Form 10-K).
58492_16_ITEM15_P411_S0	Directors may receive the equity component of their compensation in restricted stock or restricted stock units (RSUs).
58492_16_ITEM15_P411_S1	In either case, the awards generally have a 12-month vesting period, ending on the day preceding the next annual meeting of shareholders.
58492_16_ITEM15_P411_S2	Vesting accelerates in the event of death, disability or a change in control of the Company.

Flanigan, certify, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that: (1) The Report fully complies with the requirements of section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and (2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
58492_16_ITEM15_P543_S1	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to Leggett Platt, Incorporated and will be retained by Leggett Platt, Incorporated and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
58492_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices and automobiles.
58492_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	As discussed below, our continuing operations are organized into 17 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Products; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.
58492_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.
58492_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products.
58492_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Innovative proprietary products and low cost have made us the largest U.S. manufacturer in many of these businesses.
58492_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting those end-consumer needs.
58492_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	We attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, purchasing leverage, and large-scale production.
58492_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	Sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising, and marketing their products.
58492_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	In our Commercial Products segment we design, manufacture, and distribute a wide range of components and finished products for the office seating and sleep specialty, furniture and other retail markets.
58492_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	We are a major provider of adjustable beds and fashion beds, with domestic manufacturing and distribution capability as well as established relationships with global supply sources.
58492_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The quality of our products and service, together with our low cost, have made Leggett Platt the leading U.S. supplier of high-carbon drawn steel wire.
58492_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_17_ITEM1_P4_S2	We have three wire mills that supply virtually all of the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_17_ITEM1_P4_S3	We also supply steel wire to trade customers that operate in a broad range of markets.
58492_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	We use about 70% of our wire output to manufacture our own products, including:
58492_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Industrial Materials segment also has a diverse group of trade customers that include:
58492_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, manufactures and sells products including automotive seating components, tubing assemblies for the aerospace industry, bedding industry machinery, and service van interiors.
58492_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	Our established design capability and focus on product development have made us a leader in innovation.
58492_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	We also benefit from our broad geographic presence and our internal production of key raw materials and components.
58492_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	For information about sales to trade customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note E on page 86 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Because of the divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business in late 2014, along with the retirement of the Senior Operating Vice President of the Industrial Materials segment, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed effective January 1, 2015.
58492_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses were moved from Residential Furnishings to Commercial Products.
58492_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Aerospace Products business was moved from Industrial Materials to Specialized Products.
58492_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The Spuhl machinery operation (which produces wire forming equipment primarily for our internal use) was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Furnishings.
58492_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	Additionally, our logistics operations, which primarily include intercompany transportation activity, were moved from Residential Furnishings to Industrial Materials.
58492_17_ITEM1_P10_S4	These segment changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.
58492_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	For information regarding 2017 changes in segment reporting, see "Change in Segment Reporting for 2017" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 33.
58492_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price.
58492_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through an approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth.
58492_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	For information about our TSR targets and performance see the discussion under "Total Shareholder Return" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 31.
58492_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	During the past three years, we generated $1.29 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
58492_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions.
58492_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash.
58492_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	For information about dividends and share repurchases see the discussion under "Pay Dividends" and "Repurchase Stock" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 46.
58492_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest).
58492_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), operating cash flows, and return on assets.
58492_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets.
58492_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, improve market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	We revised our TSR framework in September 2016 to moderately increase the expected long-term contribution from revenue growth to 6-9% (from 4-5% previously).
58492_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Over the last three years, our average annual revenue growth has been approximately 3%.
58492_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	Growth from the combination of increased unit volume and acquisitions has approximated 7% during that time period, but this was partially offset by a 4% reduction from divestitures, commodity deflation and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our long-term 6-9% annual revenue growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing TSR; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for bolt-on businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
58492_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	We acquired three small businesses for an aggregate purchase price of roughly $30 million.
58492_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The first was a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies.
58492_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	This business further expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities, and also adds precision machining to our aerospace platform.
58492_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	We also acquired a distributor of geo-synthetic products and a South African producer of mattress innersprings.
58492_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	In addition to these acquisitions, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China for $35 million.
58492_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	This business manufactures seat comfort products and lumbar support systems.
58492_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture.
58492_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	The initial cash outlay for the 70% interest was $12 million and, per the terms of the agreement, we will acquire the remaining 30% in two equal parts, in 2018 and 2020.
58492_17_ITEM1_P26_S3	We have recorded a long-term liability of approximately $11 million for these future payments.
58492_17_ITEM1_P26_S4	The recorded liability is based upon estimates and may fluctuate significantly until the payment dates.
58492_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	We acquired Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring production facilities for a purchase price of $45 million.
58492_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	This additional volume enhanced our economies of scale, benefited from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire, and allowed manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base.
58492_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-style motion furniture components for a purchase price of $17 million.
58492_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products.
58492_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	For more information regarding our acquisitions, please refer to Note Q on page 111 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	We divested four small businesses for total net consideration of $72 million.
58492_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	We sold two Wire Products operations, one that manufactures wire partitions, perimeter guarding and storage lockers, and another that manufactures automatic wire strapping equipment and related consumable wire products.
58492_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	We also sold a CVP operation that designs and assembles docking stations for mobile computing equipment in vehicles.
58492_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Finally, we sold a Machinery business that assembles industrial sewing machines.
58492_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	We sold four operations for total consideration of $36 million.
58492_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	We sold our final two Store Fixtures operations and a small operation within our CVP business.
58492_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	We also sold our Steel Tubing business unit.
58492_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	This business manufactured welded steel tubing and fabricated tube components.
58492_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	We divested the majority of the Store Fixtures group for total consideration of $64 million.
58492_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our Store Fixtures group designed, produced, installed and managed our customer's store fixture projects.
58492_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 81 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	The percentages of our trade sales in continuing operations related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Our international operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico.
58492_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our products in these foreign locations primarily consist of:
58492_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	Adjustable beds Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for our components is growing.
58492_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have also expanded internationally in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas to supply them more efficiently.
58492_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 75% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Globally, we have 126 manufacturing facilities; 77 located in the U.S. and 49 located in 18 foreign countries, as shown below.
58492_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	For further information concerning our continuing operations trade sales related to products manufactured, and our tangible long-lived assets located outside the United States, refer to Note E on page 86 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	The following table shows our approximate percentage of continuing operations trade sales by product line for the last three years:
58492_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	1 The Steel Tubing Group was sold in December 2015.
58492_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel.
58492_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
58492_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials.
58492_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	In 2016, our largest customer accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated revenues.
58492_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 30% of these consolidated revenues.
58492_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Specialized Products and Commercial Products segments.
58492_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations as of December 31, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
58492_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.
58492_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	We maintain research, development and testing centers in many locations around the world.
58492_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	However, we estimate our cost of research and development was approximately $25 million in each of the last three years.
58492_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 21,300 employees, of which roughly 15,700 were engaged in production.
58492_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	Of the 21,300, approximately 12,000 were international employees (6,200 in China).
58492_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Roughly 15% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues.
58492_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2016.
58492_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2017.
58492_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.
58492_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 20,000 employees.
58492_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through innovation, product quality, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well.
58492_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	For information about antidumping duty orders regarding innerspring and steel wire rod imports, see "Competition" in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 32.
58492_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and divestitures, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses.
58492_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have slightly higher sales, while the first and fourth quarters have generally been lower.
58492_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	Segment level seasonality has also been relatively limited, however the Residential Furnishings segment usually has lower sales in the fourth quarter.
58492_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of Cash from Operations in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 42.
58492_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.
58492_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_17_ITEM1_P67_S2	While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
58492_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	We routinely post information for investors under the Investor Relations section of our website (www.leggett.com).
58492_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
58492_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	In addition to these reports, the Company s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section.
58492_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
58492_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	For information on discontinued operations, see Note B on page 81 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves risk.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Conversely, if raw material costs decrease, we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in past years.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed and this would negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Higher raw material costs in past years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	This primarily impacted our Residential Furnishings product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	If this was to occur again it could negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Although we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have, at December 31, 2016, an aggregate litigation contingency accrual of $3 million.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies (which include Brazilian VAT and other matters) are estimated to be $26 million.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If our assumptions or analysis regarding these contingencies is incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the $26 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	For more information regarding our legal contingencies, see Note S on page 115 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In 2016, 34% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	At December 31, 2016, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $956 million, or 32% of our total assets.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled $703 million, or 24% of total assets.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which would negatively impact our earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	For more information regarding potential goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment, refer to Note C on page 83 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have transitioned certain corporate-level shared service systems primarily related to our U.S. operations for general ledger, cash application, purchasing and accounts payable disbursements to a new platform during the first quarter of 2017.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure could create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Economic uncertainty or tax law changes could impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flow and earnings.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover and interest rates.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and drive demand for our components and products.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one-quarter of our sales.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, low consumer confidence, or a depressed housing market could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are exposed to political, regulatory, and legislative risks that may arise from actions by U.S. or foreign governments that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In 2016, 34% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Further, many of our businesses obtain products, components and raw materials from global suppliers.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, regulatory, and legislative risks inherent in operating in numerous countries.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	These regulations and laws are complex and may change.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	If the U.S. or foreign governments adopt or change regulations, this could negatively impact our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are subject to the tax laws and reporting rules of the U.S. (federal, state and local) and several foreign jurisdictions.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Current economic and political conditions make these tax rules (and governmental interpretation of these rules) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change and uncertainty.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	There have been proposals, most notably by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, to reform tax laws or change interpretations of existing tax rules.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Some of these proposals, if adopted, could significantly impact how multinational corporations are taxed on their earnings and transactions.
58492_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will become law, or how they might be interpreted, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri.
58492_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	We currently have 126 manufacturing locations, of which 77 are located across the United States and 49 are located in 18 foreign countries.
58492_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also have various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	For more information regarding the geographic location of our manufacturing facilities refer to "Geographic Areas of Operation" under Item 1 Business on page 14.
58492_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	In 2016, 73% of the Company's net sales allocated to the 126 manufacturing facilities was produced by owned facilities.
58492_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_17_ITEM2_P2_S2	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note J on page 94 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of our 126 manufacturing facilities, none are subject to liens or encumbrances that are material to the segment in which they are reported or to the Company as a whole.
58492_17_ITEM2_P4_S0	None of our physical properties are, by themselves, material to the Company s overall manufacturing processes, except for our steel rod mill in Sterling, Illinois, which is reported in Industrial Materials.
58492_17_ITEM2_P4_S1	The rod mill consists of approximately 1 million square feet of production space and has annual output of approximately 500,000 tons of steel rod, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_17_ITEM2_P4_S2	Although we have alternative sources of steel rod from external sources, a prolonged disruption to the operation of the rod mill could have a material adverse effect on the Industrial Materials segment and the Company s results of operations.
58492_17_ITEM2_P5_S0	In the opinion of management, the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_17_ITEM2_P5_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_17_ITEM2_P5_S2	Our productive capacity, in general, continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_17_ITEM2_P5_S3	However, utilization has increased in many of our businesses with improving market demand, and we are investing to support growth in several of our businesses, including Automotive, U.S. Spring and European Spring.
58492_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The information in Note S beginning on page 115 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated into this section by reference.
58492_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	On March 27, 2013, Region 5 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Notice of Violation/Finding of Violation ("NOV/FOV") alleging that our subsidiary, Sterling Steel Company, violated the Clean Air Act and the Illinois State Implementation Plan currently in place.
58492_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	Sterling operates a steel rod mill in Sterling, Illinois.
58492_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	The NOV/FOV alleges that Sterling, since 2008, has exceeded the allowable annual particulate matter and manganese emission limits for its arc furnace.
58492_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	Sterling requested a conference with the EPA to discuss the alleged violations.
58492_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	The conference was held on May 20, 2013.
58492_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	On July 23, 2013, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation alleging that Sterling violated the opacity limitations of its air permit and Federal and state regulations.
58492_17_ITEM3_P3_S1	A conference to discuss the Finding of Violation occurred in the third quarter of 2013.
58492_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	There had been no material updates with respect to these matters until mid-July 2015 when the Company learned from counsel for the EPA that the matters had been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).
58492_17_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Company met with representatives of the EPA and the DOJ on February 2, May 25 and June 15, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM3_P4_S2	At the meetings, the government focused on Sterling's compliance with capture and control efficiency and fugitive emissions with its electric arc furnace.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S0	On September 26, 2016, the EPA directed Sterling to perform a ventilation study.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S1	Sterling submitted its proposed ventilation study to the EPA on November 15, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S2	On December 28, 2016, the EPA approved the proposed study.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S3	We expect to complete the study in the first half of 2017.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S4	Sterling intends to vigorously defend these matters in any enforcement action that may be pursued by the EPA or DOJ.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S5	Neither the EPA nor DOJ specified any amount of penalty being sought in any proceeding to enforce the NOV/FOV, Finding of Violation or in any conference or meeting.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S6	Any settlement or adverse finding could result in the payment by Sterling of fines, penalties, capital expenditures, or some combination thereof.
58492_17_ITEM3_P5_S7	Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect them, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
58492_17_ITEM4_P0_S0	The following information is included in accordance with the provisions of Part III, Item 10 of Form 10-K and Item 401(b) of Regulation S-K.

58492_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below highlights quarterly and annual stock market information for the last two years.
58492_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Price and volume data reflect composite transactions; price range reflects intra-day prices; data source is Bloomberg.
58492_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 10, 2017, we had 8,626 shareholders of record.
58492_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Increasing the dividend remains a high priority.

58492_17_ITEM5_P7_S3	This standing authorization was first reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, filed August 5, 2004, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors.
58492_17_ITEM5_P7_S4	As such, effective January 1, 2017, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2017.

58492_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Sales decreased in 2016, with growth in unit volume and acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price deflation, and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Sales growth continued in Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, but several other businesses experienced soft market demand and lower unit volume during the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased reflecting several factors, including divestiture gains, lower income taxes, and reduced share count.
58492_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Steel inflation in late 2016 and the non-recurrence of a pricing lag benefit associated with deflation in late 2015 offset the benefit from increased unit volume.
58492_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	We continue to optimize our portfolio by increasing investment in those businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive.
58492_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	We increased capital expenditures in 2016 to support product categories that are growing.
58492_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, we acquired three small businesses and purchased the remaining minority interest in a key Automotive joint venture in China.
58492_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	We also divested four small operations during the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Operating cash flow increased significantly versus 2015 levels.
58492_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Payments made to settle foam litigation in 2015 did not recur, and in 2016 we received litigation settlement proceeds related to a separate matter.
58492_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	Cash from operations also benefited from reduced working capital.
58492_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We raised the quarterly dividend by 6% in 2016 (the largest increase since 2007) and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 45 years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	We also bought back 4.5 million shares of our stock.
58492_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	During the year, we extended the term of and expanded the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to $750 million and correspondingly increased our commercial paper program.
58492_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	We ended 2016 with net debt to net capital comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%, as discussed on page 49.
58492_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	We target TSR in the top third of the S P 500 over the long term.
58492_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	For the three years ended December 31, 2016, we generated TSR in the top 11% of the S P 500.
58492_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	With this top-third TSR goal continuing to be our primary long-term financial objective, in September we revised our TSR framework to place a moderately higher emphasis on disciplined growth and a lesser requirement on further profit margin expansion.
58492_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay: TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price.
58492_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	We seek to achieve TSR in the top third of the S P 500 over the long-term through an approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We monitor our TSR performance relative to the S P 500 on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2016, we generated TSR of 20% per year on average, well above the S P 500's 9% annual TSR for that same time period.
58492_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	That performance placed us in the top 11% of the S P 500, achieving our top-third goal.
58492_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	During 2016, we reevaluated our long-standing TSR framework and concluded that a few modifications were appropriate.
58492_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	We moderately increased the expected long-term contribution from revenue growth (to 6-9% per year on average) and reduced the expected benefit from additional EBIT margin increases.
58492_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	The table below shows the components of TSR, including our prior targets and our revised current targets.
58492_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	Accomplishing this level of performance over rolling three-year periods should enable us to consistently attain our top-third TSR goal.
58492_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 7% of our sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized.
58492_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	They include most producers of residential furniture and bedding, automotive and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.
58492_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately 20% of our sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod.
58492_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	This is a benefit that our competitors do not have.
58492_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_17_ITEM7_P16_S3	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_17_ITEM7_P16_S4	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, and we also realize a lag as costs decline.
58492_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_17_ITEM7_P17_S2	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Throughout 2015, market prices for steel scrap, rod, and flat-rolled products decreased significantly, leading to downward pressure on selling prices.
58492_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	We realized a beneficial pricing lag during 2015, as costs generally decreased at a faster rate than selling prices.
58492_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	In 2016, steel costs have once again become volatile.
58492_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	Steel inflation during the first half of the year was followed by deflation in the third quarter, and significant inflation late in the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	With the normal lag in selling price increases, this cost inflation led to margin pressure in the fourth quarter.
58492_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	We are implementing price increases in early 2017 to begin recovering the higher costs.
58492_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile in past years and were moderately compressed in late 2016.
58492_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in past years and generally have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality of their products and manage their costs, while providing higher profits for our operations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Many of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering innovation, better product quality, and customer service.
58492_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued.
58492_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the imposition of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod.
58492_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	The antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%.
58492_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	Both remain in effect through December 2019.
58492_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett and several other U.S. manufacturers formed a coalition to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act.
58492_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	The ENFORCE Act requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.
58492_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	We previously disclosed that we were a plaintiff in an antitrust case against The Dow Chemical Company.
58492_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	We, along with other plaintiffs, alleged that several defendants conspired to fix prices and allocate customers and markets for certain urethane chemical products.
58492_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	We reached a settlement for our antitrust claims against The Dow Chemical Company in 2016 by agreeing to release our claims regarding this matter for a net cash payment of approximately $38 million (pretax, after deducting expenses).
58492_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	We received payment in 2016 and recorded after-tax income of $25 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	Because the settlement is largely attributable to our former Prime Foam Products business, $20 million was reflected in discontinued operations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	In conjunction with a change in executive officers, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed as of January 1, 2017.
58492_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	Effective January 1, 2017, Perry E. Davis became President of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segments, and J. Mitchell Dolloff became President of the Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments.
58492_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The composition of our four segments also changed effective January 1, 2017.
58492_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	The table below outlines the new segment structure.
58492_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	The new structure will be largely the same as in prior years except that the Home Furniture Group will be moved from Residential Products (formerly Residential Furnishings) to Furniture Products (formerly Commercial Products), and the Machinery Group will be moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products.
58492_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Industrial Products segment (formerly Industrial Materials) will have no changes.
58492_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Sales decreased 4% in 2016, with slightly higher unit volume and acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price deflation, and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Sales growth continued in Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, but several other businesses experienced soft market demand and lower unit volume during the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased from several factors, including divestiture gains.
58492_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	The benefit from increased unit volume and lower income taxes was partially offset by steel inflation and the non-recurrence of a pricing lag benefit associated with deflation late in 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2016, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Sales decreased 4%, with unit volume growth and small acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price decreases, and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	Strong growth in Automotive was partially offset by soft demand in several other markets, including bedding and home furniture.
58492_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	During 2016, we divested two Wire Products operations, a CVP business and a Machinery operation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	These businesses had total combined annual sales of approximately $100 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Operationally, earnings also benefited from higher unit volume and lower income taxes related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	These improvements were partially offset by steel inflation that began to occur in late 2016 and the non-recurrence of the prior year pricing lag benefit (that occurred as steel costs deflated in late 2015).
58492_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	In 2016, increasing steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO expense of $11 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	In 2015, significant deflation in steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 75.
58492_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net interest expense in 2016 decreased slightly due to the repayment of a $200 million 5% note in August 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our tax rate is determined by a combination of items, some recurring and some discrete.
58492_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Recurring items include things like income earned in various tax jurisdictions, and differences in tax rates in those jurisdictions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	These items tend to be relatively stable from year to year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	Conversely, discrete items are things that may not be as consistent from year to year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	While the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 35% in both years, our worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 25% in 2016, compared to 27% for 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	In both years our tax rate benefited from earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 6% in each year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	In addition, the 2016 tax rate benefited by 3% related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions in the year, and 1% (net) from other items.
58492_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	The 2015 tax rate benefited by 1% related to the reduction of a tax accrual for Chinese earnings that we decided to reinvest within China to acquire the remaining interest in a joint venture and 1% (net) from other items.
58492_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	In the first quarter of 2016 we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79).
58492_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	This ASU provides that the tax effects of stock-based awards must be treated as discrete items affecting the tax rate in the interim reporting period in which the tax deductions occur.
58492_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Many variables (such as timing of award settlements or expirations, changes in stock price over time, ultimate payout levels for awards with performance contingencies, shares cancelled before vesting, and the tax rules in effect at the time of settlement) will impact both the timing and the amount of the tax deductions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Thus, this ASU is likely to add more volatility to the effective tax rate of companies such as Leggett that use stock-based compensation plans.
58492_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	In the following section we discuss 2016 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for each of our segments.
58492_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 86.
58492_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on trade sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Residential Furnishings sales decreased 6% in 2016 from a combination of lower unit volume in several product categories, lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds (which originate in Commercial Products but are occasionally distributed through Residential Furnishings), raw material-related price decreases, and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	Within our U.S. Spring business, total innerspring units decreased 6%, but growth continued in ComfortCore (our pocketed coil innersprings), with unit volume in that category up 4%.
58492_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Volume also increased in our European Spring business but declined in Home Furniture.
58492_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2016 due to a litigation gain ($7 million) and non-recurrence of last year's foam litigation expense ($5 million).
58492_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Operationally, the impact on EBIT from lower unit volume was partially offset by pricing discipline.
58492_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Sales in Commercial Products increased slightly from a Work Furniture acquisition completed in March 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Same location sales were down slightly for the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 1% (versus strong growth in each of the prior two years) as we began ramping up new programs selling directly to major bedding retailers and transitioning away from former programs with bedding manufacturers.
58492_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	The decline in these bedding customer programs also caused the decrease in "pass-through sales of adjustable beds" discussed in the Residential Furnishings segment above.
58492_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2016, primarily from operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million, and a favorable sales mix.
58492_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Same location sales in Industrial Materials were down 12% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire.
58492_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Total sales in the segment declined 25%, also reflecting the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business in late 2015 and two small Wire Products operations in 2016.
58492_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased due to a divestiture gain ($16 million) from the sale of one of the Wire Products operations, and the non-recurrence of the prior year's impairment charge ($6 million) and divestiture loss ($3 million), both associated with the sale of the Steel Tubing business.
58492_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	The impact during the year from operational improvements and lower unit volume essentially offset.
58492_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 6% in 2016, with volume gains in Automotive and a small Aerospace acquisition completed early in the year, partially offset by divestitures of two small CVP operations, and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased from higher sales, a divestiture gain ($11 million) related to the sale of a CVP operation, and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	These items were partially offset by goodwill impairment of $4 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	We have agreed to sell real estate associated with the remaining CVP business and expect to realize a gain on this transaction in the first half of 2017.
58492_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	This property reached held for sale status in 2016, causing the fair value of the CVP reporting unit to fall below its carrying value, and triggering the $4 million impairment charge.
58492_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $19 million from $1 million in 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	This increase is primarily due to a litigation gain ($20 million) related to our former Prime Foam business.
58492_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 81.
58492_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	Sales from continuing operations grew 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Nearly all of our businesses experienced unit volume growth during the year from a combination of new program awards, market share gains, and broadly improving end market demand.
58492_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Full year earnings from continuing operations increased significantly reflecting several factors, including the benefit from higher sales, pricing discipline, and lower foam litigation expense.
58492_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2015, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Same location sales (from continuing operations) grew 1%, with volume gains in Automotive, in most of our Residential Furnishings businesses, and in Adjustable Bed, largely offset by raw material-related price deflation and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	Full year 2015 sales growth also benefited from the July 2014 acquisition of Tempur Sealy's three innerspring component production facilities, the March 2015 acquisition of a Work Furniture business, and other smaller acquisitions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	In late 2015, we sold our Steel Tubing business (which had total annual sales of approximately $100 million), and a small CVP operation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	These divestitures did not significantly impact the comparison of 2015's sales to the prior year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased significantly in 2015, primarily from higher sales and pricing discipline.
58492_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	million in 2015 versus $33 million in 2014).
58492_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Partially offsetting these improvements was a one-time lump-sum pension buyout funded from pension plan assets late in 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	All of our segments use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	In our consolidated financials, an adjustment is made at the corporate level (i.e., outside the segments) to convert about 50% of our inventories to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.
58492_17_ITEM7_P63_S2	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_17_ITEM7_P63_S3	In 2014, steel costs were relatively stable and we ended the year with LIFO expense of $1 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P63_S4	Significant deflation in steel costs during 2015, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 75.
58492_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Net interest expense in 2015 increased slightly versus 2014.
58492_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our tax rate is determined by a combination of items, some recurring and some discrete.
58492_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	Recurring items include things like income earned in various tax jurisdictions, and differences in tax rates in those jurisdictions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P66_S2	These items tend to be relatively stable from year to year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P66_S3	Conversely, discrete items are things that may not be as consistent from year to year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	While the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 35% in both years, our worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 27% in 2015, compared to 24% for 2014.
58492_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	In both years our tax rate benefited from earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 6% in 2015, and 7% in 2014.
58492_17_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, the 2015 tax rate benefited by 1% related to the reduction of a tax accrual for Chinese earnings that we decided to reinvest within China to acquire the remaining interest in a joint venture, and 1% (net) from other items.
58492_17_ITEM7_P67_S3	The 2014 tax rate benefited by 3% related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deductions claimed for the current and prior years, and 1% (net) from other items.
58492_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	In the following section we discuss 2015 sales and EBIT from continuing operations for each of our segments.
58492_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 86.
58492_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier.
58492_17_ITEM7_P69_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P69_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on trade sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Residential Furnishings sales increased 5% in 2015, with unit volume growth in most product categories and acquisitions partially offset by raw material-related price decreases and currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P70_S1	Volume grew in Bedding, Home Furniture, Geo Components, and Fabric Converting.
58492_17_ITEM7_P70_S2	Within our U.S. Spring business, we again experienced significant growth in ComfortCore (our pocketed coil innersprings), with unit volume in that product category up 51%.
58492_17_ITEM7_P70_S3	We expect strong growth in this category to continue from our introduction of new ComfortCore products and our customers' growing use of these components in their product lines.
58492_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015 due to higher sales, pricing discipline, and significantly lower foam litigation expense ($48 million).
58492_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Sales in Commercial Products increased 21% in 2015, with same location sales up 12%.
58492_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	Continued strong demand in the Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed businesses drove this improvement.
58492_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	Unit volume in the Adjustable Bed business increased 51% from a combination of new programs and strength in ongoing customer programs.
58492_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	In our Work Furniture business, we acquired a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture.
58492_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	Acquisitions contributed 9% to the segment's sales growth during the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2015, primarily from higher sales and improved operating efficiency.
58492_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	Sales in the segment decreased 4% in 2015, with higher unit volume in Drawn Wire more than offset by steel-related price decreases and reduced rod mill trade sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin improved versus 2014, with cost reductions more than offsetting a $6 million impairment charge and a $3 million divestiture loss, both of which related to the sale of our Steel Tubing business late in the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 4% in 2015, with volume gains in Automotive and Machinery partially offset by currency impact.
58492_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Our Automotive business continued to experience strong growth from a combination of factors, including expanded component content (via upgraded features), participation in new vehicle platforms, and continued industry growth in each of the major markets.
58492_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased primarily from higher sales.
58492_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $1 million from a loss of $124 million in 2014.
58492_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	This significant increase is primarily due to the non-recurrence of a goodwill impairment charge of $93 million related to the Store Fixtures business, and foam litigation accruals of $22 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	The divestiture of the majority of the Store Fixtures business late in 2014 resulted in an additional loss of $5 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P79_S3	Two remaining Store Fixtures facilities were sold in 2015 and resulted in a gain of $3 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June of each year, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	In 2014, we concluded that an impairment charge of $108 million ($93 million after tax) was required for our Store Fixtures group.
58492_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	This non-cash impairment charge reflected the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures group.
58492_17_ITEM7_P80_S4	For more information, see Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 83.
58492_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 81.
58492_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Cash from operations was very strong in 2016.
58492_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	In each year for over 25 years, our operations have provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments.
58492_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	We expect this to again be the case in 2017.
58492_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	We continue to invest to support businesses and product categories that are growing.
58492_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	This resulted in higher capital expenditures in 2016, and we expect further increases in 2017.
58492_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	We raised the quarterly dividend by 6% (the largest increase since 2007) and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 45 years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	We also bought back 4.5 million shares of our stock during the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	In May 2016, we extended the term of our revolving credit facility to May 2021 and expanded the borrowing capacity from $600 million to $750 million and correspondingly increased our commercial paper program.
58492_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	We ended 2016 with net debt to net capital comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%, as discussed on page 49.
58492_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	Cash from operations increased significantly in 2016.
58492_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Payments we made to settle foam litigation in 2015 (totaling $82 million) did not recur, and in 2016 we received litigation settlement proceeds (of $25 million net of taxes paid) related to the antitrust claims discussed on page 33.
58492_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Cash from operations also reflected higher earnings and lower working capital.
58492_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	The reduction in working capital was driven primarily by changes in accounts payable that were largely due to steel price inflation in late 2016 (versus deflation in late 2015).
58492_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Cash from operations should exceed $450 million in 2017, with working capital increases attributable to sales growth and inflation expected to be uses of cash.
58492_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	We closely monitor our working capital levels, and we ended 2016 with adjusted working capital at 9.4% of annualized sales 1 .
58492_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our operating efficiency and performance related to trade receivables, total inventories, and accounts payable.
58492_17_ITEM7_P91_S1	We believe this provides a more useful measurement to investors since cash and current maturities can fluctuate significantly from period to period.
58492_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	As discussed on page 50, a substantial amount of our cash is held by international operations and may not be immediately available to reduce debt on a dollar for dollar basis.
58492_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($904 million in 2016 and $945 million in 2015) multiplied by 4.
58492_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.
58492_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Calculations of days are as follows: 1.
58492_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	Days sales outstanding: ((beginning of year trade receivables + end of year trade receivables) 2) (net trade sales number of days in the year).
58492_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	2. Days inventory on hand: ((beginning of year trade inventory + end of year inventory) 2) (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_17_ITEM7_P94_S3	Days payables outstanding: ((beginning of year accounts payable + end of year accounts payable) 2) (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Trade Receivables - Our net trade receivables and our days sales outstanding at December 31, 2016 did not meaningfully change compared to the prior year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	We continue to look for ways to improve speed of customer payments, including third party programs with early payment incentives in certain circumstances.
58492_17_ITEM7_P95_S2	We obtain credit applications, credit reports, bank and trade references, and periodic financial statements from our customers to establish credit limits and terms.
58492_17_ITEM7_P95_S3	In cases where a customer s payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves.
58492_17_ITEM7_P95_S4	Our provision for losses on accounts receivable has averaged $3 million and our allowance for bad debt as a percentage of our net receivables has averaged 2% for the last three years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	Days inventory on hand of 66 days at the end of 2016 is within a reasonable historical range, and we believe the increase compared to the prior year does not indicate a greater risk of inventory obsolescence.
58492_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	We continuously monitor our slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory through reports on inventory quantities compared to usage within the previous 120 days.
58492_17_ITEM7_P96_S2	We also utilize cycle counting programs and complete physical counts of our inventory.
58492_17_ITEM7_P96_S3	When potential inventory obsolescence is indicated by these controls, we will take charges for write-downs to maintain an adequate level of reserves.
58492_17_ITEM7_P96_S4	We have averaged inventory obsolescence charges of $10 million annually for the last three years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P96_S5	Our reserve balances (not including our LIFO reserves) as a percentage of our year-end inventory were 6.4% at the end of 2016, which is consistent with our historical average.
58492_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	Accounts Payable - The increase in accounts payables of $44 million at December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year is primarily due to steel price volatility experienced in both 2016 (increasing prices, particularly toward the end of the year) and 2015 (decreasing prices, particularly toward the end of the year).
58492_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Our payment terms did not change meaningfully in 2016 or 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	We continue to optimize payment terms through our significant purchasing power and also utilize third party services that allow flexible payment options.
58492_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	Cash is readily available to fund growth.
58492_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	In certain of our businesses and product lines we have minimal excess capacity, and we are investing to support continued growth.
58492_17_ITEM7_P100_S1	In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production over the next few years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	In Bedding, we are investing in equipment to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore innersprings and newer product features.
58492_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	We will continue to make investments to support expansion in businesses and product lines where sales are growing, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance.
58492_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	We expect capital expenditures to approximate $150 million in 2017.
58492_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Our employee incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital.
58492_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	This emphasis focuses our management on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.
58492_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	In some of our businesses, we have capacity to accommodate additional volume.
58492_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	For each $100 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $25 million to $35 million of additional pre-tax earnings.
58492_17_ITEM7_P103_S2	The earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, higher utilization in our businesses from market share gains and higher market demand.
58492_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Our long-term 6-9% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our Grow business units, and we are looking for opportunities to enter new growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	In 2014, we purchased Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring production facilities for $45 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-style motion components for residential furniture.
58492_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	In 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for an initial cash outlay of $12 million and will acquire the remaining 30% in two equal parts, in 2018 and 2020 for a currently estimated amount of $11 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	In 2016, we acquired three small businesses for a total purchase price of $30 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P107_S1	The first, a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities and adds precision machining to our aerospace platform.
58492_17_ITEM7_P107_S2	The second is a distributor of geosynthetic products, and the third, a South African producer of mattress innersprings.
58492_17_ITEM7_P107_S3	In addition to these acquisitions, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China for $35 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 111.
58492_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	Increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	In 2016, we increased the quarterly dividend by $.02, or 6%, to $.34 per share, our largest quarterly increase since 2007.
58492_17_ITEM7_P109_S2	This extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 45 years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P109_S3	Our targeted dividend payout ratio is approximately 50-60% of continuing operations adjusted EPS (which would exclude special items such as divestiture gains, impairment charges, litigation accruals and settlement proceeds).
58492_17_ITEM7_P109_S4	We expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth.
58492_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	As shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in each of the last three years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	During that time frame, we repurchased a total of 14.3 million shares of our stock and issued 8.4 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 4%.
58492_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	In 2016, we repurchased 4.5 million shares (at an average price of $46.52) and issued 2.4 million shares.
58492_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	Our top priorities for uses of cash are organic growth (via capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P111_S1	After funding those priorities, to the extent there is remaining cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash.
58492_17_ITEM7_P111_S2	We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.
58492_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	___________________________________________ (1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps.
58492_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	(2) The unused credit amount is based upon our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program which, at the end of 2015, had $600 million of borrowing capacity.
58492_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	The credit facility was amended in the second quarter of 2016 to increase the borrowing capacity to $750 million and the commercial paper program was increased to a corresponding amount.
58492_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	(3) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	The next table shows the ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2016 and 2015, calculated in two ways:
58492_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	Long-term debt and total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	Long-term debt and total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	We use these adjusted (non-GAAP) measures as supplemental information to track leverage trends across time periods with variable levels of cash.
58492_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	Our long-term target is to have net debt as a percentage of net capital in the 30-40% range.
58492_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	As discussed on page 50, a substantial amount of cash is held by our international operations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	Therefore, we may not be able to use all of our cash to reduce our debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as reflected in the net debt to net capital ratio.
58492_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $15 million in 2016, all of which occurred in commercial paper.
58492_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $750 million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by our $750 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 14 lenders.
58492_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	In May 2016, we increased the borrowing capacity under the facility and extended the term by two years to 2021.
58492_17_ITEM7_P124_S2	The credit facility allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P124_S3	When we issue letters of credit under the facility, we reduce our available credit and commercial paper capacity by a corresponding amount.
58492_17_ITEM7_P124_S4	Amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	The average and maximum amounts of commercial paper outstanding during 2016 were $292 million and $345 million, respectively.
58492_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $282 million and $323 million respectively.
58492_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, but we had issued $57 million of stand-by letters of credit under other bank agreements to take advantage of better pricing.
58492_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	With operating cash flow, cash on hand, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt, as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.
58492_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	Our revolving credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations contain restrictive covenants, with which we were comfortably in compliance as of December 31, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	The covenants limit, among other things: a) our total amount of indebtedness to 65% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit facility), b) the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) the amount of assets sold, transferred or disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 40% of total consolidated assets.
58492_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	For more information about long-term debt, see Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 93.
58492_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	At December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $282 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	Nearly all of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	We do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing U.S. liquidity needs.
58492_17_ITEM7_P129_S2	If we were to bring all foreign cash back immediately to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we would incur incremental tax expense of up to $50 million based upon our average historic foreign tax rate.
58492_17_ITEM7_P129_S3	However, due to capital requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $59 million of this cash is currently inaccessible for repatriation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P129_S4	In 2016, 2015, and 2014, we brought back cash of $5 million, $112 million, and $129 million, respectively, at little to no added tax cost.
58492_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2016:
58492_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	Other obligations include our net reserves for tax contingencies in the "More Than 5 Years" column because these obligations are long-term in nature and actual payment dates can not be specifically determined.
58492_17_ITEM7_P133_S2	Other obligations also include our current estimate of minimum contributions to defined benefit pension plans.
58492_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_17_ITEM7_P134_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_17_ITEM7_P134_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_17_ITEM7_P134_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 75.
58492_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	In the second quarter of 2016, we sold one of our two remaining Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) businesses, and real estate associated with the remaining CVP business reached held for sale status.
58492_17_ITEM7_P139_S1	As a result of these two events, the fair value of the CVP reporting unit had fallen below it's book value, and we fully impaired the remaining $4 million of goodwill for this reporting unit in the second quarter of 2016.
58492_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	During 2015, the Steel Tubing unit met the held for sale criteria.
58492_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	Because fair value less cost to sell had fallen below recorded book value, we fully impaired this unit's goodwill and incurred a non-cash charge of $4 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	In 2014, we concluded that an impairment was required related to the goodwill of the Store Fixtures group, which was formerly part of the Commercial Products segment and is now reported in discontinued operations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P141_S1	A non-cash charge of $108 million was recorded for the complete write-off of the goodwill associated with this business.
58492_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of June 30 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
58492_17_ITEM7_P142_S1	We begin with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model.
58492_17_ITEM7_P142_S2	Judgment is required in the two step model to estimate fair value for the reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	We estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_17_ITEM7_P144_S1	Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	The June 2016 qualitative review indicated it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amount, except for our CVP reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 83.
58492_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	At December 31, 2016, we had $791 million of goodwill.
58492_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible.
58492_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	Impairments averaged less than $2 million per year over the last three years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	At December 31, 2016, net property, plant and equipment was $566 million and net intangible assets other than goodwill was $165 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	We value inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover).
58492_17_ITEM7_P159_S1	Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product.
58492_17_ITEM7_P159_S2	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e., not selling very quickly).
58492_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving.
58492_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	At December 31, 2016, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $33 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories).
58492_17_ITEM7_P163_S1	This is consistent with the December 31, 2015 and 2014 reserves of $33 million and $30 million, respectively, representing 6% of FIFO inventories.
58492_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	Additions to inventory reserves in 2016 were $9 million, which were comparable to the previous year.
58492_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	We do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels.
58492_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay (since we are self-insured).
58492_17_ITEM7_P166_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $8 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P167_S2	At December 31, 2016, we had accrued $34 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	Internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years and are expected to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future.
58492_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	The average annual amount of customer-related bad debt expense was $3 million (significantly less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	At December 31, 2016, our allowances for doubtful accounts were less than $8 million (about 2% of our trade accounts and notes receivable of $458 million).
58492_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	We have not experienced any significant individual customer bankruptcies in the past three years.
58492_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	We believe the financial health of our major customers has modestly improved, but some are highly leveraged, and this could cause circumstances to change in the future.
58492_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid, which also impacts current year pension expense.
58492_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	Determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities).
58492_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	Other assumptions include rates of compensation increases, withdrawal and mortality rates, and retirement ages.
58492_17_ITEM7_P178_S2	These estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.5 million and increases the plans benefit obligation by $9 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P179_S1	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.4 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	Mortality assumptions represent our best estimate of the duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date.
58492_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	These estimates are based on each plans' demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances.
58492_17_ITEM7_P181_S2	Longer life expectancies increased our pension liability for our most significant plans by approximately $20 million in 2014.
58492_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_17_ITEM7_P182_S1	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred, we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss.
58492_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost.
58492_17_ITEM7_P183_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable.
58492_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 115.
58492_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	During the three year period ended December 31, 2016, we recorded accruals of $108 million ($70 million for continuing operations and $38 million in discontinued operations).
58492_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	A large percentage of these accruals related to a series of antitrust lawsuits involving the sale of polyurethane foam as discussed in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM7_P185_S2	During 2015, we fully resolved the substantial majority of these cases for amounts not materially different than the amounts originally accrued.
58492_17_ITEM7_P185_S3	Additional details of the 2015 settlements can be found in Note T - Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Form 10-K filed February 25, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	With the exception of antitrust matters, our largest annual accrual for litigation claims was $6 million for the five years ending December 31, 2016 (excluding legal fees).
58492_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_17_ITEM7_P187_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM7_P187_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_17_ITEM7_P187_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P187_S4	If necessary, we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_17_ITEM7_P189_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $26 million and $32 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to net operating losses and other tax carryforwards.
58492_17_ITEM7_P189_S2	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_17_ITEM7_P189_S3	In cases where we believe it is more likely than not that we may not realize the future potential tax benefits, we establish a valuation allowance against them.
58492_17_ITEM7_P190_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_17_ITEM7_P190_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_17_ITEM7_P191_S0	Changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non-repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_17_ITEM7_P191_S1	If all non-repatriated earnings were taxed at current rates, we would incur additional tax expense of approximately $131 million.
58492_17_ITEM7_P192_S0	Audits by various taxing authorities continue as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_17_ITEM7_P192_S1	Based upon past audit experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_17_ITEM7_P193_S0	The likelihood of recovery of net operating losses and other tax carryforwards has been closely evaluated and is based upon such factors as the time remaining before expiration, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_17_ITEM7_P193_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_17_ITEM7_P193_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_17_ITEM7_P193_S3	Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense.
58492_17_ITEM7_P194_S0	Accruals for Probable Losses Although the Company denies liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, in millions, as follows:
58492_17_ITEM7_P195_S0	A large percentage of the accruals and cash payments in the table above are related to antitrust proceedings.
58492_17_ITEM7_P195_S1	The above litigation contingency accrual does not include accrued expenses related to workers' compensation, automobile, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense.
58492_17_ITEM7_P195_S2	However, any litigation expense associated with these categories is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM7_P195_S3	For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 92.
58492_17_ITEM7_P196_S0	We have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, and to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
58492_17_ITEM7_P196_S1	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current known facts, that additional losses, if any, are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM7_P196_S2	However, based upon current known facts, as of December 31, 2016, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable, and therefore not recorded) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $26 million, including approximately $21 million for Brazilian VAT matters and $5 million for other matters.
58492_17_ITEM7_P196_S3	If our assumptions or analyses regarding these contingencies are incorrect, or if facts change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals, and even greater than our estimate of reasonably possible losses in excess of recorded accruals.
58492_17_ITEM7_P196_S4	For more information regarding litigation contingencies, please refer to Note S on page 115 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.
58492_17_ITEM7_P197_S0	The FASB has issued accounting guidance effective for current and future periods.
58492_17_ITEM7_P197_S1	See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79 for a more complete discussion.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The table below provides information about the Company s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The fair value of fixed rate debt was greater than its $750 carrying value by $25.2 at December 31, 2016, and greater than its $750 carrying value by $13.4 at December 31, 2015.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The increase in the fair market value of the Company s debt is primarily due to the increase in credit spreads as compared to the prior year end, increased interest rates, and the timing of interest payments.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2016 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated spread over such Treasury securities representing the Company s interest costs for its medium-term notes.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	These rates exclude the amortization of interest rate swap.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates and foreign currency.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	It is the Company s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair value hedges is provided in Note R beginning on page 112 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company views its investment in foreign subsidiaries as a long-term commitment and does not hedge translation exposures.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	This investment may take the form of either permanent capital or notes.
58492_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	investment (i.e., total assets less total liabilities subject to translation exposure) in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar at December 31 is as follows:
58492_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes, Financial Statement Schedule and supplementary financial information included in this Report are listed and included in Item 15, and are incorporated by reference into this item.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	An evaluation as of December 31, 2016, was carried out by the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )).
58492_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of December 31, 2016, to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Disclosure controls and procedures, include without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting can be found on page 68, and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm regarding the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting can be found on page 69 of this Form 10-K. Each is incorporated by reference into this Item 9A.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the design to transition certain corporate-level shared service systems for general ledger, cash application, accounts payable, purchasing and accounts payable disbursements to a new platform.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	We substantially completed all testing during the fourth quarter of 2016 and transitioned the majority of the systems in January 2017.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The new platform is expected to further automate and enhance a number of existing processes and activities primarily related to our U.S. operations.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The total capital outlay for this activity will be approximately $20 million, most of which has been recorded in the prior two years.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	These improvements are ongoing system processes and system enhancements and are not being made in response to any control deficiency or weakness.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting has been, and we expect will continue to be, effective through this transition.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Implementation risk has been, and will be, controlled through an on-going process of monitoring and evaluation to mitigate potential risk.
58492_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	The system deployments include fully evaluating and updating our internal control over financial reporting, as well as significant testing and training.
58492_17_ITEM10_P0_S0	The subsections entitled Proposal 1 Election of Directors, Corporate Governance, Board and Committee Composition and Meetings, Consideration of Director Nominees and Diversity, Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance and Director Independence in the Company s definitive Proxy Statement for the Company s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 9, 2017, are incorporated by reference.

58492_17_ITEM15_P6_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett Platt assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_17_ITEM15_P8_S0	Under the supervision and with the participation of management (including ourselves), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2016 , based on the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

58492_17_ITEM15_P11_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

58492_17_ITEM15_P11_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
58492_17_ITEM15_P11_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P11_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

58492_17_ITEM15_P11_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P12_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

58492_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the accrual and disclosure of loss contingencies.
58492_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_17_ITEM15_P23_S1	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_17_ITEM15_P23_S2	Other notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business or to support other business opportunities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P23_S3	Other notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Interest income is not recognized for nonperforming accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
58492_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_17_ITEM15_P28_S2	The cost for approximately 50% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_17_ITEM15_P28_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_17_ITEM15_P28_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	We have had no material changes in inventory writedowns or slow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves in any of the years presented.
58492_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	The following table presents the activity in our LIFO reserve for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

58492_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-08 "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity", beginning in 2015, a business is classified as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations or financial results, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, or is disposed of by sale or otherwise.
58492_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	For 2014 and previous years, a business was classified as a discontinued operation when (i) the operations and cash flows of the business were clearly distinguished and were eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the business was either disposed of or was classified as held for sale; and (iii) we did not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the business after the disposal transactions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P34_S2	Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_17_ITEM15_P35_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_17_ITEM15_P36_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_17_ITEM15_P36_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell.
58492_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held for sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_17_ITEM15_P40_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	Loss contingencies are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
58492_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs.
58492_17_ITEM15_P42_S0	Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable.
58492_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	Legal fees are accrued when incurred.
58492_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	Property is reviewed for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_17_ITEM15_P47_S2	Our ten reporting units are the business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available.
58492_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
58492_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	If after such an assessment, with regard to each reporting unit, the Company concludes that the goodwill of a reporting unit is not impaired, then no further action is required (commonly referred to as the Step Zero Analysis approach).
58492_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	For those reporting units where a significant change or event occurs, and where potential impairment indicators exist (based on the Step Zero Analysis approach), recoverability of goodwill is then evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_17_ITEM15_P50_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_17_ITEM15_P51_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P51_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_17_ITEM15_P52_S0	Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach.
58492_17_ITEM15_P52_S1	Each method is generally given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P52_S2	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_17_ITEM15_P52_S3	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P52_S4	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_17_ITEM15_P53_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price-to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to projected earnings for the next two years.
58492_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a control premium.
58492_17_ITEM15_P53_S3	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_17_ITEM15_P53_S4	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_17_ITEM15_P53_S5	Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_17_ITEM15_P55_S0	Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, sales growth, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P56_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P56_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_17_ITEM15_P57_S0	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P58_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P58_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_17_ITEM15_P59_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_17_ITEM15_P59_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_17_ITEM15_P59_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_17_ITEM15_P59_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers.
58492_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_17_ITEM15_P62_S0	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities or workforce reductions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P62_S1	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P63_S0	We recognize a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_17_ITEM15_P64_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_17_ITEM15_P65_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_17_ITEM15_P65_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_17_ITEM15_P66_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_17_ITEM15_P66_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_17_ITEM15_P66_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_17_ITEM15_P67_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_17_ITEM15_P68_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_17_ITEM15_P68_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_17_ITEM15_P68_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_17_ITEM15_P68_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_17_ITEM15_P69_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute products for the various end markets described in Note E.
58492_17_ITEM15_P69_S1	Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Europe, China, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.
58492_17_ITEM15_P70_S0	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_17_ITEM15_P70_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_17_ITEM15_P70_S2	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of other notes receivable.
58492_17_ITEM15_P71_S0	Other notes receivable have historically primarily consisted of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business or to support other business opportunities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P71_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_17_ITEM15_P72_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_17_ITEM15_P73_S0	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_17_ITEM15_P74_S0	To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_17_ITEM15_P74_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P75_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P76_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_17_ITEM15_P76_S1	Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.
58492_17_ITEM15_P76_S2	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon reasonable estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_17_ITEM15_P77_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to foreign currency and interest rates.
58492_17_ITEM15_P77_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P77_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P78_S0	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_17_ITEM15_P78_S1	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P78_S2	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_17_ITEM15_P78_S3	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P79_S0	On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P80_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_17_ITEM15_P81_S0	The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_17_ITEM15_P81_S1	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_17_ITEM15_P81_S2	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_17_ITEM15_P82_S0	Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM15_P83_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_17_ITEM15_P83_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_17_ITEM15_P84_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_17_ITEM15_P85_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_17_ITEM15_P85_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_17_ITEM15_P85_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_17_ITEM15_P86_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years information in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to conform to the 2016 presentation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	These were primarily associated with a balance sheet reclassification for new accounting guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs as discussed below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regularly issues updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification that are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (ASU).
58492_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	Below is a summary of the ASUs, effective for current or future periods, most relevant to our financial statements:
58492_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	ASU 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting : Simplifies the financial reporting for share-based compensation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P88_S1	We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2016:
58492_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	All income tax effects of stock-based compensation are now classified within income tax expense, rather than recognizing some of the effects in additional contributed capital.
58492_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	To the extent tax deductions from stock-based compensation payments differ from the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes, the tax effects are recorded as discrete items in that quarter.
58492_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	Prospective application was required, and the impact of adopting this new guidance resulted in an additional tax benefit of $18.2 for 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	This ASU impacted the calculation of the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation on earnings per share, which resulted in an increase in our average diluted shares outstanding of approximately .5 shares.
58492_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	The income tax effects are now classified as cash flow from operations, rather than cash flow from financing activities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	We have elected to apply this cash flow classification guidance prospectively.
58492_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	Consistent with our past practice, when shares are withheld from the issuance of stock to fund the payment of the employee s taxes, the payment is classified as a financing activity.
58492_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	We have elected to continue to estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest, rather than electing to account for forfeitures as they occur.
58492_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	ASU 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs : Changes the presentation of long-term debt issuance costs in the financial statements to a reduction of the related liability rather than as a separate asset.
58492_17_ITEM15_P95_S1	We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2016 and retrospectively reclassified net deferred loan costs associated with each of our long-term debt issuances from assets to long-term debt on the balance sheet.
58492_17_ITEM15_P95_S2	The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	To be adopted in future years:
58492_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	ASU 2016-02 Leases : Requires that a lessee recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for most lease arrangements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P97_S1	This ASU will be effective January 1, 2019, and we are assessing all potential impacts of the standard.
58492_17_ITEM15_P97_S2	Currently, we anticipate adopting this standard January 1, 2019.
58492_17_ITEM15_P97_S3	We believe it will increase our assets and liabilities for the addition of right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet.
58492_17_ITEM15_P97_S4	We are also evaluating its impact on our statements of operations and cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	ASUs 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) , and 2016-16 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory are currently being evaluated, however, we do not expect these updates to materially impact our future financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers : Supersedes most of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition and prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
58492_17_ITEM15_P99_S1	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this ASU by one year, which results in the new standard being effective January 1, 2018.
58492_17_ITEM15_P99_S2	In addition, the FASB has issued several amendments to the standard during 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	This standard permits two transition methods, the full retrospective method or the modified retrospective method.
58492_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	The new standard will also require expanded disclosures pertaining to revenues from contracts with customers in the notes to the financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P101_S0	We established a cross-functional implementation team in 2014 to assess all potential impacts of this standard We continue to make progress in implementing the new revenue standard and in evaluating its impact on our future financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P101_S1	We have not yet selected a transition method.
58492_17_ITEM15_P101_S2	We will apply the guidance at the new revenue standard s effective date of January 1, 2018.
58492_17_ITEM15_P102_S0	The FASB has issued accounting guidance, in addition to the issuance discussed above, effective for current and future periods.
58492_17_ITEM15_P102_S1	This guidance did not have a material impact on our current financial statements, and we do not believe it will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P103_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2014, we divested the majority of our Store Fixtures reporting unit, which was previously part of the Commercial Products segment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P103_S1	We sold the final Store Fixtures business in the fourth quarter of 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P103_S2	Total consideration for these businesses was approximately $72 during this time period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P103_S3	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of these businesses.
58492_17_ITEM15_P104_S0	The table below includes activity related to discontinued operations for the years presented:
58492_17_ITEM15_P105_S0	In 2016, we reached a litigation settlement of our antitrust claims against The Dow Chemical Company by agreeing to release our claims regarding this matter for a net cash payment of approximately $38.0 (pretax, after deducting expenses).
58492_17_ITEM15_P105_S1	Of this amount, $31.4 was associated with our former Prime Foam Products unit (previously part of the Residential Furnishings Segment), which we sold in March 2007.
58492_17_ITEM15_P105_S2	The after-tax income associated with the settlement was approximately $25 , of which approximately $20 is reflected in discontinued operations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P105_S3	This matter is now fully resolved.
58492_17_ITEM15_P105_S4	In an unrelated matter, accruals of $2.0 , $.7 and $35.3 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively were recorded in discontinued operations for antitrust litigation expense associated with the Prime Foam Products unit as discussed in Note S. (3) The 2016 tax expense is primarily related to The Dow Chemical settlement.
58492_17_ITEM15_P105_S5	The 2014 tax benefit is primarily related to the Store Fixtures goodwill impairment and the Prime Foam litigation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P106_S0	We had excess real estate considered held for sale of $ 11.0 and $ 8.4 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
58492_17_ITEM15_P107_S0	The following businesses were divested during the periods presented, but did not meet the discontinued operations criteria.
58492_17_ITEM15_P108_S0	We realized a gain of $21.2 related to the sale of the Wire Products operations in 2016 and a gain of $11.2 related to the sale of a CVP operation in the second quarter of 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P108_S1	No material gains or losses were realized on the sale of other businesses.
58492_17_ITEM15_P109_S0	Pre-tax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.
58492_17_ITEM15_P110_S0	Charges associated with discontinued operations are reported on the Statements of Operations in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_17_ITEM15_P111_S0	As discussed in Note A, we test other long-lived assets for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_17_ITEM15_P112_S0	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges noted above were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers or third party estimates of fair value less selling costs.
58492_17_ITEM15_P113_S0	As discussed in Note A, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least once a year and as triggering events may occur.
58492_17_ITEM15_P113_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_17_ITEM15_P114_S0	Because all reporting unit fair values exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 55% (as a percent of fair value) during the 2015 review, we performed a qualitative assessment (Step Zero Analysis) for our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P114_S1	Among other things, we considered i) the excess in fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying amount from the most recent quantitative analysis, ii) macroeconomic conditions, iii) industry and market trends, and iv) overall financial performance.
58492_17_ITEM15_P115_S0	Based on the Step Zero Analysis we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amount, except for our CVP reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P116_S0	With regard to our CVP reporting unit, in the second quarter of 2016 we sold one of our two remaining businesses.
58492_17_ITEM15_P116_S1	Additionally, real estate associated with the remaining CVP business reached held for sale status during the second quarter of 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P116_S2	As a result of these two events, the fair value of the CVP reporting unit (consisting of one remaining business) had fallen below its carrying amount, and we fully impaired the remaining $3.7 of goodwill for this reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P117_S0	The 2015 goodwill impairment review indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P118_S0	The Steel Tubing unit met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P118_S1	Because fair value less costs to sell had fallen below recorded book value, we fully impaired this unit's goodwill and incurred a $4.1 goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P119_S0	The fair values of reporting units in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in the second quarter 2015 review are presented in the table below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P120_S0	After completing our annual goodwill impairment review in June 2014, we concluded that a goodwill impairment charge was required for one reporting unit, Store Fixtures which was recorded as discontinued operations, and was previously part of the Commercial Products segment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P120_S1	This resulted in a $108.0 goodwill impairment and reflected the complete impairment of all goodwill associated with the Store Fixtures reporting unit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P121_S0	As discussed in Note B, the majority of the Store Fixtures business was divested in November 2014, and the remainder in the fourth quarter 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P122_S0	The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P123_S0	(1) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Steel Tubing unit as outlined in Note C. (2) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Commercial Vehicle Products unit as outlined in Note C.

58492_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	We have four operating segments that supply a wide range of products:
58492_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_17_ITEM15_P127_S1	Each reportable segment has a senior operating vice-president that reports to the chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker.
58492_17_ITEM15_P127_S2	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P128_S0	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements, except that the segment assets and income reflect the FIFO basis of accounting for inventory.
58492_17_ITEM15_P129_S1	Certain inventories are accounted for using the LIFO basis in the consolidated financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	We evaluate performance based on EBIT.
58492_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices.
58492_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P132_S1	Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales.
58492_17_ITEM15_P132_S2	These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.
58492_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	A summary of segment results for the periods presented are as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	(1) - Intersegment eliminations and other includes $12.1 of a lump-sum pension settlement (See Note L).
58492_17_ITEM15_P135_S0	Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance.
58492_17_ITEM15_P135_S1	These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P135_S2	Segment assets for all years are reflected at their estimated average for the year.

58492_17_ITEM15_P150_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015 we repaid $200 of 5.00% notes.
58492_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $750 of commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $750 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 14 lenders.
58492_17_ITEM15_P151_S1	The credit facility allows us to issue total letters of credit up to $250 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P151_S2	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the facility, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_17_ITEM15_P151_S3	We had no outstanding letters of credit under the facility at year end for the periods presented.
58492_17_ITEM15_P152_S0	Amounts outstanding at December 31 related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	The revolving credit facility and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit a) the total amount of indebtedness to 65% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit facility), b) the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) the amount of assets sold, transferred or disposed of in any trailing four quarter period to 40% of total consolidated assets.
58492_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	We have remained well within compliance with all such covenants.
58492_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	We may elect one of four types of borrowing under the revolving credit facility, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance.
58492_17_ITEM15_P154_S1	various published rates plus a pre-defined spread.
58492_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	We are required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P155_S1	Any outstanding principal under this facility will be due upon the maturity date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P155_S2	We may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under this facility, in whole or in part, upon three business days notice.

58492_17_ITEM15_P160_S0	We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.
58492_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	Shares are issued from treasury for the majority of our stock plans activity.
58492_17_ITEM15_P162_S1	All share information is presented in millions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan (the "Plan").
58492_17_ITEM15_P163_S1	On May 10, 2012, the Plan changed the way awards granted are charged against the number of available shares.
58492_17_ITEM15_P163_S2	Under the 2012 Plan modification, each option counts as one share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as three shares against the Plan.

58492_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	Prior to 2013, we granted stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months , 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_17_ITEM15_P169_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are amortized by the straight-line method over the options total vesting period, except for employees who are retirement eligible.
58492_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	Expense for employees who are retirement eligible is recognized immediately.
58492_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	A person is retirement eligible if the employee is age 65 , or age 55 with 20 years of Company service.
58492_17_ITEM15_P173_S0	We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_17_ITEM15_P174_S0	Stock options under this program are granted on the last business day of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_17_ITEM15_P174_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five , divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_17_ITEM15_P174_S2	The option has a 10 -year term.
58492_17_ITEM15_P174_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P175_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on each acquisition date, and they vest immediately.
58492_17_ITEM15_P176_S1	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_17_ITEM15_P176_S2	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_17_ITEM15_P176_S3	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.

58492_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	Stock option information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	Prior to 2005, we granted options with a below market exercise price under the terms of our Deferred Compensation Program.
58492_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	In 2005, we amended the Program to provide only at market stock options.
58492_17_ITEM15_P180_S2	During 2016, there were no significant options exercised at a below market exercise price, and less than .1 of these options remain outstanding at December 31, 2016.

58492_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
58492_17_ITEM15_P183_S0	The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option.
58492_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility through the grant date, measured daily for a time period equal to the option s expected life.
58492_17_ITEM15_P184_S1	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_17_ITEM15_P185_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_17_ITEM15_P185_S2	In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.
58492_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_17_ITEM15_P186_S1	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer matching accounts after three years of service.
58492_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	Participant contributions are credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we make premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_17_ITEM15_P188_S2	A participant s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_17_ITEM15_P188_S3	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units.
58492_17_ITEM15_P188_S4	The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company that will be settled in cash.
58492_17_ITEM15_P188_S5	Both the assets and liabilities associated with this program are presented in the table above and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	Company matching contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P189_S1	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program and may be settled in cash at our discretion.
58492_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P190_S1	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.
58492_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	Information for the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	Details regarding stock unit activity for the ESUP plan are reflected in the stock units summary table below.

58492_17_ITEM15_P195_S0	The peer group consists of all the companies in the Industrial, Materials and Consumer Discretionary sectors of the S P 500 and S P Midcap 400 (approximately 320 companies).
58492_17_ITEM15_P195_S1	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our TSR ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3 -year performance period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P196_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies.
58492_17_ITEM15_P196_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three -year vesting period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P197_S0	Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU s for the periods presented:
58492_17_ITEM15_P198_S0	We intend to pay out 65% of awards in shares of our common stock and 35% in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_17_ITEM15_P198_S1	The 35% portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P199_S0	RSU awards are generally granted as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P200_S0	The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P201_S0	The PGI awards are issued to certain key management employees as growth performance stock units (GPSUs).
58492_17_ITEM15_P201_S1	The GPSUs vest ( 0% to 250% ) at the end of a two -year performance period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P201_S2	Vesting is based on the Company's or applicable profit center's revenue growth (adjusted by a GDP factor when applicable) and EBITDA margin over a two -year performance period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P201_S3	The 2014 base target PGI award was .1 shares, 2015 and 2016 were less than .1 shares.
58492_17_ITEM15_P201_S4	If earned, we intend to pay half in shares of our common stock and half in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_17_ITEM15_P201_S5	Both components are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.

58492_17_ITEM15_P205_S0	The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a net liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
58492_17_ITEM15_P205_S1	Our U.S. plans (comprised primarily of three significant plans) represent approximately 88% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.
58492_17_ITEM15_P205_S2	Participants in one of the significant domestic plans have stopped earning benefits; this plan is referred to as "frozen" in the following narrative.
58492_17_ITEM15_P206_S0	A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P207_S0	Accumulated and projected benefit obligation information at December 31 is recapped below:
58492_17_ITEM15_P208_S0	Included in the above plans is a subsidiary s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.
58492_17_ITEM15_P208_S1	This is a non-qualified plan, and these benefits are secured by insurance policies that are not included in the plan s assets.
58492_17_ITEM15_P208_S2	Cash surrender values associated with these policies at December 31 were as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P209_S0	Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions are reflected below:
58492_17_ITEM15_P210_S0	Of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2016, the portions expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in 2017 are as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P211_S0	Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P212_S0	Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.
58492_17_ITEM15_P213_S0	We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10-year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points).
58492_17_ITEM15_P214_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P214_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_17_ITEM15_P215_S0	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P216_S0	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings, as discussed below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P217_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that separates fair value valuation techniques into the following categories:
58492_17_ITEM15_P218_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_17_ITEM15_P219_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_17_ITEM15_P220_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_17_ITEM15_P221_S0	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_17_ITEM15_P222_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities, as well as a stable value fund.
58492_17_ITEM15_P222_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P223_S0	Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_17_ITEM15_P223_S1	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_17_ITEM15_P223_S2	In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_17_ITEM15_P223_S3	Approximately 55% of our significant plans (the "frozen plans") are employing a Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% fixed income and 40% equities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P223_S4	The remaining significant plans (the "active" plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% fixed income, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_17_ITEM15_P224_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to seven different investments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P225_S0	Six are mutual funds, all of which are passively managed low-cost index funds, and include:
58492_17_ITEM15_P226_S0	U.S. Total Stock Market Index: Large -, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_17_ITEM15_P227_S0	U.S. Large-Cap Index: Large-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_17_ITEM15_P228_S0	U.S. Small-Cap Index: Small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_17_ITEM15_P229_S0	World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world.
58492_17_ITEM15_P230_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market.
58492_17_ITEM15_P231_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to U.S. treasuries with maturities of 20-30 years.
58492_17_ITEM15_P232_S0	The Stable value fund consists of a fixed income portfolio offering consistent return and protection against interest rate volatility.
58492_17_ITEM15_P233_S0	In October 2015, we offered a voluntary one-time lump-sum payment option to certain eligible terminated vested participants in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans that, if accepted, would settle our obligation to them.
58492_17_ITEM15_P233_S1	The program provided participants with a one-time choice to receive a lump-sum settlement of their remaining pension benefit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P233_S2	As part of this voluntary lump-sum program, we settled $35.7 of pension obligations for U.S. retirees in 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P233_S3	This was paid from plan assets and did not require a cash contribution from the company.
58492_17_ITEM15_P233_S4	As a result of these settlements, we recorded settlement losses of $12.1 ( $7.5 net of tax) reflecting the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses in the plan proportionate to the obligation that was settled.
58492_17_ITEM15_P233_S5	These settlement charges were recorded in "Cost of goods sold" and "Selling and administrative expenses" with a corresponding balance sheet reduction in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" for the year ended December 31, 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P234_S0	We expect to contribute $5.8 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2017.
58492_17_ITEM15_P235_S0	Estimated benefit payments, expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P236_S0	Total expense from continuing operations for defined contribution plans was as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P237_S0	We have limited participation in two union-sponsored, defined benefit, multi-employer pension plans.
58492_17_ITEM15_P237_S1	These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_17_ITEM15_P237_S2	Aggregate contributions to these plans were less than $.8 for each of the years presented.
58492_17_ITEM15_P238_S0	In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if a plan has unfunded vested benefits.
58492_17_ITEM15_P238_S1	Factors that could impact the funded status of these plans include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P238_S2	Withdrawal liability triggers could include a plan's termination, a withdrawal of substantially all employers, or our voluntary withdrawal from the plan (such as decision to close a facility or the dissolution of a collective bargaining unit).
58492_17_ITEM15_P238_S3	We have a very small share of the liability among the participants of these plans.
58492_17_ITEM15_P238_S4	Based upon the information available from plan administrators, both of the multi-employer plans in which we participate are underfunded and estimate our aggregate share of potential withdrawal liability for both plans to be $23.1 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P238_S5	We have not recorded any material withdrawal liabilities for the years presented.
58492_17_ITEM15_P239_S0	The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P240_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
58492_17_ITEM15_P241_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P242_S0	For all periods presented, the tax rate benefited from income earned in various foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily related to China, Croatia, and Luxembourg.
58492_17_ITEM15_P242_S1	Other significant items impacting each year's tax rate are:
58492_17_ITEM15_P243_S0	We recognized net tax benefits totaling $21.4 , including a tax benefit related to stock-based compensation from the first quarter adoption of ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting".
58492_17_ITEM15_P244_S0	2015: We recognized net tax benefits totaling $9.4 , including a reduction in deferred taxes on undistributed foreign earnings associated with a planned reinvestment in China, and a deferred tax benefit related to our Australian operations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P245_S0	2014: We recognized net tax benefits totaling $10.9 , primarily related to additional Domestic Production Activities Deductions for the current and prior years, incremental deferred foreign tax credits, and net favorable provision-to-return adjustments related to prior year taxes.
58492_17_ITEM15_P246_S0	Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 discussed above, all net excess tax benefits related to stock plan activity were recorded to additional contributed capital, which totaled $15.4 and $10.1 in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
58492_17_ITEM15_P247_S0	We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_17_ITEM15_P247_S1	In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_17_ITEM15_P247_S2	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities can no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_17_ITEM15_P247_S3	In addition, once the statute expires we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_17_ITEM15_P248_S0	The total amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016, is $16.7 , of which $9.7 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_17_ITEM15_P248_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P249_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_17_ITEM15_P250_S0	As of December 31, 2016, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2013 through 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P250_S1	In 2015, the IRS examined our 2013 tax return for a U.S. non-consolidated filing entity, L P Financial Services Co., and the audit was concluded with no adjustments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P250_S2	There are no current IRS examinations in process nor are we aware of any forthcoming.
58492_17_ITEM15_P251_S0	Additionally, at December 31, 2016, eight tax years were either subject to or undergoing audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2009 through 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P251_S1	The examinations in process are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any likely material adjustments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P251_S2	In 2016, we settled an appeal with the Canada Revenue Agency relative to our 2007 and 2008 tax years related to transfer pricing issues.
58492_17_ITEM15_P251_S3	The net impact of this settlement on our financial statements was not material.
58492_17_ITEM15_P252_S0	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years also remain open to examination, though we believe any assessments would not be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P253_S0	It is reasonably possible that the resolution of certain tax audits could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, as certain tax positions may either be sustained on audit or we may agree to certain adjustments, or resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P253_S1	It is not expected that any change would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P254_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P254_S1	The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P255_S0	The net decrease in our net operating losses and other tax carryforwards in 2016 primarily relates to anticipated utilization of Canadian net operating losses we expect on our tax return filing.
58492_17_ITEM15_P256_S0	All changes in other Deferred Income Tax categories are not material.
58492_17_ITEM15_P257_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss, tax credit, and capital loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_17_ITEM15_P257_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_17_ITEM15_P257_S2	Individually, none of these tax carryforwards presents a material exposure.
58492_17_ITEM15_P258_S0	These tax carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, with no amount greater than $10 expiring in any one year.
58492_17_ITEM15_P259_S0	Deferred income and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_17_ITEM15_P260_S0	The tax effect of most distributions would be significantly offset by available foreign tax credits.
58492_17_ITEM15_P260_S1	Although withholding taxes would be due on dividends from certain of our China subsidiaries to their non-U.S. parent, a subsidiary of the U.S. company, the earnings are still permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and are included in the undistributed earnings and incremental taxes discussed below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P260_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have accrued $9.2 and $6.9 , respectively, of deferred taxes related to incremental withholding taxes in China.
58492_17_ITEM15_P261_S0	Deferred income taxes and withholding taxes have not been provided on certain foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
58492_17_ITEM15_P261_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings which are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2016, are $762.8 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P261_S2	If such earnings were taxable in the U.S., we estimate that the resulting incremental tax expense would be approximately $131.2 based on present income tax laws, which are subject to change.
58492_17_ITEM15_P261_S3	In 2016, the foreign earnings we repatriated were immaterial, and resulted in no significant net tax benefit or cost.
58492_17_ITEM15_P262_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P263_S0	The components of other (income) expense from continuing operations were as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P264_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_17_ITEM15_P265_S0	We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P266_S0	The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P267_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_17_ITEM15_P268_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_17_ITEM15_P269_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_17_ITEM15_P269_S1	Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_17_ITEM15_P269_S2	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_17_ITEM15_P269_S3	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_17_ITEM15_P269_S4	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_17_ITEM15_P270_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_17_ITEM15_P271_S0	* Includes both current and long-term amounts combined.
58492_17_ITEM15_P272_S0	The fair value for fixed rate debt (Level 2) was greater than its carrying value by approximately $25 and $13 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
58492_17_ITEM15_P272_S1	The carrying value was $750.0 for both years.
58492_17_ITEM15_P273_S0	The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note Q and evaluating long-term assets (including goodwill) for potential impairment as discussed in Note C. Determining fair values for these items requires significant judgment and includes a variety of methods and models that utilize significant Level 3 inputs.
58492_17_ITEM15_P274_S0	Long-lived assets, acquisitions and the second step of a goodwill impairment test utilize the following methodologies in determining fair value: (i) Buildings and machinery are valued at an estimated replacement cost for an asset of comparable age and condition.
58492_17_ITEM15_P274_S1	Market pricing of comparable assets are used to estimate replacement cost where available.
58492_17_ITEM15_P275_S0	The most common identified intangible assets are customer relationships and tradenames.
58492_17_ITEM15_P275_S1	Customer relationships are valued using an excess earnings method, using various inputs such as the estimated customer attrition rate, future earnings forecast, the amount of contributory asset charges, and a discount rate.
58492_17_ITEM15_P275_S2	Tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty method, which is based upon comparable market royalty rates for tradenames of similar value.
58492_17_ITEM15_P276_S0	(iii) Inventory is valued at current replacement cost for raw materials, with a step-up for work in process and finished goods items that reflects the amount of ultimate profit earned as of the valuation date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P276_S1	(iv) Other working capital items are generally recorded at face value, unless there are known conditions that would impact the ultimate settlement amount of the particular item.
58492_17_ITEM15_P277_S0	The following table contains the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P277_S1	A portion of the goodwill included in the table below is expected to provide an income tax benefit.
58492_17_ITEM15_P278_S0	The following table summarizes acquisitions for the periods presented.
58492_17_ITEM15_P279_S0	We are finalizing all of the information required to complete the purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_17_ITEM15_P280_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_17_ITEM15_P280_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2016 and 2015 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_17_ITEM15_P281_S0	Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash at a later date and are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P281_S1	At December 31, 2016, there was no substantial remaining consideration payable, other than the liability associated with our 2015 acquisition discussed below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P282_S0	A brief description of our acquisition activity by year is included below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S0	We acquired three small businesses for a total purchase price of $29.2 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S1	The first, a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities and adds precision machining to our aerospace platform.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S2	The second is a distributor of geosynthetic products, and the third, a South African producer of mattress innersprings.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S3	In addition to these acquisitions, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China for $35.2 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S4	We acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S5	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S6	The initial cash outlay for the 70% interest was $12.3 and per the terms of the agreement, we will acquire the remaining 30% interest in two equal parts, in 2018 and 2020.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S7	We have recorded a long-term liability of approximately $11.0 for these future payments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S8	Future payments are estimated based upon a calculation that incorporates EBITDA and the recorded liability may fluctuate significantly until the payment dates.
58492_17_ITEM15_P283_S9	Any changes in this liability will be reflected in interest income or expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P284_S0	We acquired Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring production facilities for a purchase price of $44.5 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P284_S1	This additional volume enhanced our economies of scale, benefited from our vertical integration in steel rod and wire, and allowed manufacturing optimization across a broad asset base.
58492_17_ITEM15_P284_S2	These factors contributed to the recognition of $17.8 in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_17_ITEM15_P285_S0	We also acquired a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-style motion furniture components for a purchase price of $16.8 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P285_S1	This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products.
58492_17_ITEM15_P285_S2	These factors contributed to the recognition of $4.4 in goodwill from this acquisition.
58492_17_ITEM15_P286_S0	We also acquired three other small operations, with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $18.0 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P287_S0	Derivative financial instruments that we currently use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are:
58492_17_ITEM15_P288_S0	The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_17_ITEM15_P289_S0	We have also historically used interest rate cash flow hedges to manage interest rate risks.
58492_17_ITEM15_P290_S0	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted.
58492_17_ITEM15_P291_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_17_ITEM15_P292_S0	Our fair value hedges typically manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries assets and liabilities.
58492_17_ITEM15_P293_S0	Hedges designated as fair value hedges recognize gain or loss currently in earnings.
58492_17_ITEM15_P293_S1	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_17_ITEM15_P294_S0	We have deemed ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness.
58492_17_ITEM15_P294_S1	If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of operations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P295_S0	We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P295_S1	The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution, and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.
58492_17_ITEM15_P296_S0	The following table sets forth the pre-tax (gains) losses for our hedging activities for the years presented.
58492_17_ITEM15_P297_S0	This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.
58492_17_ITEM15_P298_S0	* Discontinued operations amounts included in the above:
58492_17_ITEM15_P299_S0	(1) Interest Rate Cash Flow Hedges On August 12, 2012, we issued $300 of 10 -year notes with a coupon rate of 3.40% .
58492_17_ITEM15_P299_S1	As a part of this transaction, we settled our $200 forward starting interest rate swaps we had entered into during 2010 and recognized a loss of $42.7 , which will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense over the life of the notes.
58492_17_ITEM15_P299_S2	In anticipation of the issuance of new debt, we entered into a treasury lock agreement in October 2014.
58492_17_ITEM15_P299_S3	The treasury lock managed benchmark treasury interest rate risk associated with $50 of the additional $300 debt issued in November 2014 and was therefore settled on that same date.
58492_17_ITEM15_P299_S4	The treasury lock had an interest rate of 2.36% .
58492_17_ITEM15_P300_S0	The settlement of the treasury lock did not result in a material gain or loss.
58492_17_ITEM15_P301_S0	We are a party to various proceedings and matters involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation and other laws.
58492_17_ITEM15_P301_S1	When it is probable, in management's judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate accruals in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_17_ITEM15_P301_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings other than as indicated below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P301_S3	Also, when it is reasonably possible that we may incur additional loss in excess of recorded accruals and we can reasonably estimate the additional losses or range of losses, we disclose such additional reasonably possible losses in these notes.
58492_17_ITEM15_P302_S0	Foam Antitrust Lawsuits Beginning in August 2010, a series of civil lawsuits was initiated in several U.S. federal courts and in Canada against several defendants alleging that Leggett and Platt and certain other manufacturers of polyurethane foam products had engaged in price fixing in violation of U.S. and Canadian antitrust laws.
58492_17_ITEM15_P302_S1	We were party to several antitrust proceedings regarding polyurethane foam products.
58492_17_ITEM15_P302_S2	The majority of these proceedings were fully resolved in 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P303_S0	The ultimate amount of settlement payments in these cases was not materially different than the amounts originally accrued.
58492_17_ITEM15_P303_S1	The remaining antitrust proceeding, along with the resolution of other proceedings, is disclosed below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P304_S0	We deny all allegations in the pending antitrust proceeding.
58492_17_ITEM15_P304_S1	We will vigorously defend ourselves in this proceeding and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims.
58492_17_ITEM15_P304_S2	However, we have established an accrual for the estimated amount that we believe is necessary to resolve the pending antitrust matter.
58492_17_ITEM15_P304_S3	We also believe, based on current facts, it is reasonably possible that we may incur a loss in excess of the recorded accrual associated with the pending antitrust proceeding.
58492_17_ITEM15_P304_S4	For specific information regarding accruals, cash payments to settle litigation contingencies, and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals please see Accruals and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P305_S0	U.S. Indirect Purchaser Class Action Cases.
58492_17_ITEM15_P305_S1	We were named as a defendant in an indirect purchaser class consolidated amended complaint filed on March 21, 2011 and were subsequently sued in an indirect purchaser class action case filed on May 23, 2011, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_17_ITEM15_P305_S2	The plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and/or a class of indirect purchasers, brought damages claims under various states' antitrust and consumer protection statutes, and were seeking three times an amount of damages allegedly suffered as a result of alleged overcharges in the price of polyurethane foam products from at least 1999 to the present.
58492_17_ITEM15_P305_S3	Each plaintiff also sought attorney fees, prejudgment interest, court costs, and injunctive relief against future violations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P305_S4	The Ohio Court ordered all parties to attend non-binding mediation with a mediator of their choosing.
58492_17_ITEM15_P306_S0	Settlement of U.S. Indirect Purchaser Class Action Cases.
58492_17_ITEM15_P306_S1	We reached a tentative settlement in the U.S. Indirect Class Action cases on May 18, 2015, by agreeing to pay an amount not materially different from the amount previously accrued for this claim.
58492_17_ITEM15_P306_S2	We continue to deny all allegations in the cases, but settled the indirect purchaser class cases to avoid the risk, uncertainty, expense and distraction of litigation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P306_S3	The Court preliminarily approved the class settlement on July 31, 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P306_S4	The full settlement amount was paid in escrow in the third quarter of 2015.
58492_17_ITEM15_P306_S5	The final settlement approval hearing was held on December 15, 2015 and the Court granted final approval of the settlement.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S0	Several objectors filed notices of appeal of the order approving the class settlement to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S1	On April 14, 2016, the Court ordered the objectors to post an appeal bond by May 13, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S2	Certain of the objectors filed a motion to reconsider or stay the bond order, which the Court denied on May 12, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S3	Subsequently, three of the five objectors voluntarily dismissed their appeals.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S4	On June 20, 2016, the Sixth Circuit dismissed the remaining two appeals, one for failure to post an appeal bond, and the other because it was untimely filed.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S5	One of the two objectors filed a petition for rehearing en banc (requesting that all judges rather than the normal 3 rule on the appeal) on June 29, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S6	That petition was denied on September 27, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S7	On December 22, 2016, the objector filed a petition for a writ of certiori to the U.S. Supreme Court.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S8	The petition was denied on January 23, 2017.
58492_17_ITEM15_P307_S9	As such, these cases have been fully resolved.
58492_17_ITEM15_P308_S0	Kansas Restraint of Trade Act Cases.
58492_17_ITEM15_P308_S1	We have been named as a defendant in two individual cases alleging direct and indirect purchaser claims under the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, one filed on November 29, 2012 in the United States District Court of Kansas under the name LaCrosse Furniture Company v. Future Foam, Inc., et al. , Case No. 12-cv-2748 KHV/JPO and the other on April 11, 2013 in the District Court of Kansas under the name CAP Carpet, Inc. v. Future Foam, Inc. , Case No. 13-cv-1140-JAR-KGG.
58492_17_ITEM15_P308_S2	These two cases were previously transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio under the name In re: Polyurethane Foam Antitrust Litigation , Case No. 1:10-MD-2196.
58492_17_ITEM15_P308_S3	The claims and allegations of these plaintiffs are generally the same as the class plaintiffs (referenced above), with the exception that the Kansas plaintiffs seek full consideration damages (their total purchase amounts for the allegedly price-fixed polyurethane foam products).
58492_17_ITEM15_P308_S4	On May 15, 2015, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation remanded the cases back to the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas.
58492_17_ITEM15_P309_S0	The plaintiffs in the CAP Carpet case alleged full consideration damages of $10.1 (which they argued should be trebled to $30 ) plus prejudgment interest at a statutory rate of 10% and attorney fees.
58492_17_ITEM15_P309_S1	The trial in this case, which was scheduled for November 14, 2016, had been postponed to January 23, 2017.
58492_17_ITEM15_P309_S2	We filed a motion for partial summary judgment on March 15, 2016, on several of the key issues of the case, including arguments that CAP Carpet is not entitled to full consideration damages or prejudgment interest and that full consideration damages are not trebled.
58492_17_ITEM15_P310_S0	15, 2016, CAP Carpet also filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the availability of full consideration damages.
58492_17_ITEM15_P310_S1	On November 17, 2016, we reached a cash settlement to fully resolve the CAP Carpet case and paid the amount in the fourth quarter of 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P310_S2	The cash payment was not material to the Company and was not materially different than the amount accrued for such case.
58492_17_ITEM15_P311_S0	The plaintiff in the LaCrosse case alleges full consideration damages and prejudgment interest through 2013 in the collective amount of $22.2 , of which LaCrosse argues the full consideration portion should be trebled.
58492_17_ITEM15_P311_S1	LaCrosse also seeks an additional three years of prejudgment interest at a statutory rate of 10% and attorneys' fees.
58492_17_ITEM15_P311_S2	On January 13, 2017, LaCrosse filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings seeking the allowance of full consideration damages.
58492_17_ITEM15_P311_S3	We filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 24, 2017, on several key issues of the case, including arguments that LaCrosse is not entitled to full consideration damages or prejudgment interest and that full consideration damages are not trebled.
58492_17_ITEM15_P311_S4	On that same date, we also filed a motion to exclude testimony from LaCrosse's expert.
58492_17_ITEM15_P311_S5	Trial is scheduled to begin on August 7, 2017.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S0	Brazilian Value-Added Tax Matters All dollar amounts (in millions) presented in this section have been updated since our last filing to reflect the U.S. Dollar (USD) equivalent of Brazilian Real (BRL).
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S1	We deny all allegations in the below Brazilian actions.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S2	We believe that we have valid bases to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S3	However, these contingencies are subject to uncertainties, and based on current facts, we believe that it is reasonably possible (but not probable) that we may incur losses of approximately $21 including interest and attorney fees with respect to these assessments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S4	Therefore, because it is not probable we will incur a loss, no accrual has been recorded for Brazilian VAT matters.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S5	For specific information regarding accruals, and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals please see " Accruals and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals " below.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S6	We have $12.5 on deposit with the Brazilian government to partially mitigate interest and penalties that may accrue while we work through these matters.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S7	If we are successful in our defense of these assessments, the deposits are refundable with interest.
58492_17_ITEM15_P312_S8	These deposits are recorded as a long-term asset on our balance sheet.
58492_17_ITEM15_P313_S0	On December 22, 2011, the Brazilian Finance Ministry, Federal Revenue Office issued a notice of violation against our wholly-owned subsidiary, Leggett Platt do Brasil Ltda.
58492_17_ITEM15_P313_S1	( L P Brazil ) in the amount of $2.3 , under Case No. 10855.724660/2011-43.
58492_17_ITEM15_P314_S0	The Brazilian Revenue Office claimed that for the period beginning November 2006 and continuing through December 2007, L P Brazil used an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax primarily on the sale of mattress innerspring units in Brazil.
58492_17_ITEM15_P314_S1	L P Brazil denied the violation.
58492_17_ITEM15_P314_S2	The Federal Revenue Office upheld the assessment at the first administrative level.
58492_17_ITEM15_P314_S3	L P Brazil has filed an appeal.
58492_17_ITEM15_P314_S4	On December 29, 2011, L P Brazil received another assessment in the amount of $.1 , under case No. 10855.724509/2011-13 on the same subject matter in connection to certain import transactions carried out between 2007 and 2011.
58492_17_ITEM15_P314_S5	L P Brazil has filed its defense.
58492_17_ITEM15_P314_S6	On December 17, 2012, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued an additional notice of violation in the amount of $4.1 , under MPF Case No. 10855.725260/2012-36 covering the period from January 2008 through December 2010 on the same subject matter.

58492_17_ITEM15_P315_S0	On December 4, 2015, we filed an Annulment Action, Case No. 009658-07.2015.4.03.6110, at the judicial level seeking to obtain an injunction to allow the transfer of the cash deposit in the amount of $4.8 for the administrative case to a judicial escrow account to cover the updated liability amount of $5.1 .
58492_17_ITEM15_P315_S1	The preliminary injunction was granted on December 10, 2015, and we are awaiting the federal attorney s response.
58492_17_ITEM15_P316_S0	In addition, L P Brazil received assessments on December 22, 2011, and June 26, July 2 and November 5, 2012, and September 13, 2013 from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Office where the Revenue Office challenged L P Brazil s use of tax credits in years 2005 through 2010.
58492_17_ITEM15_P316_S1	Such credits are generated based upon the tariff classification and rate used by L P Brazil for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings.
58492_17_ITEM15_P316_S2	On September 4, 2014, the tax authorities issued five additional assessments regarding this same issue (use of credits), covering certain periods of 2011 and 2012.
58492_17_ITEM15_P316_S3	L P Brazil filed its defense denying these assessments.
58492_17_ITEM15_P316_S4	Combined with the prior assessments, L P Brazil has received assessments totaling $2.7 on the same or similar denial of tax credit matters.
58492_17_ITEM15_P317_S0	On February 1, 2013, the Brazilian Finance Ministry filed a Tax Collection action against L P Brazil in the Camanducaia Judicial District Court, Case No. 0002222-35.2013.8.13.0878, alleging the untimely payment of $.2 of social contributions (social security and social assistance payments) for the period September to October 2010.
58492_17_ITEM15_P317_S1	L P Brazil argued that the payments were not required to be made because of the application of certain tax credits that were generated by L P Brazil's use of a correct tariff code for the classification of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings (i.e., the same underlying issue at stake in the other Brazilian matters).
58492_17_ITEM15_P317_S2	On June 26, 2014, the Brazilian Revenue Office issued a new notice of violation against L P Brazil in the amount of $.8 , under Case No. 10660.721523/2014-87, covering the period from 2011 through 2012 on the same subject matter.

58492_17_ITEM15_P317_S5	L P Brazil filed its response denying the allegations.
58492_17_ITEM15_P317_S6	L P Brazil is defending on the basis that the social contribution debts were correctly offset with tax credits generated by L P Brazil's use of a correct tariff code classification for value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings (i.e., the same underlying issue at stake in the other Federal Brazilian matters).
58492_17_ITEM15_P317_S7	On December 15, 2015, the Brazilian Federal Revenue issued an assessment against L P Brazil in the amount of $.1 , under Case No. 10600.720142/2015-76 for the period of August 2010 through May 2011, as a penalty for L P Brazil s requests to offset tax credits.
58492_17_ITEM15_P317_S8	We filed our defense denying the assessment on January 8, 2016.
58492_17_ITEM15_P318_S0	State of S o Paulo, Brazil Cases.
58492_17_ITEM15_P319_S0	The State of S o Paulo, Brazil, on April 16, 2009, issued a Notice of Tax Assessment and Imposition of Fine to L P Brazil originally seeking $1.8 for the tax years 2006 and 2007, under Case No. 3.111.006 (DRT n .04-256.169/2009).
58492_17_ITEM15_P319_S1	The State of S o Paulo argued that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tariff code for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of S o Paulo.

58492_17_ITEM15_P320_S1	On September 8, 2016, the Court's expert issued an opinion that supports L P Brazil's defense, that it used the correct tariff code classification.
58492_17_ITEM15_P320_S2	We are awaiting the Court's ruling.

58492_17_ITEM15_P321_S1	Similar to the 2009 assessment (referenced above), the State of S o Paulo argues that L P Brazil was using an incorrect tax rate for the collection and payment of value-added tax on sales of mattress innerspring units in the State of S o Paulo.
58492_17_ITEM15_P321_S2	On June 21, 2013, the State of S o Paulo converted the Tax Assessment to a tax collection action against L P Brazil in the amount of $2.0 , under Sorocaba Judicial District Court, Case No. 3005528-50.2013.8.26.0602.

58492_17_ITEM15_P323_S2	L P Brazil filed its response denying any violation.

58492_17_ITEM15_P323_S4	L P Brazil filed its response denying the assessments on June 5, 2014.
58492_17_ITEM15_P324_S0	Although the Company denies liability in all threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, as follows:
58492_17_ITEM15_P325_S0	A large percentage of the accruals and cash payments in the table above are related to antitrust proceedings.
58492_17_ITEM15_P325_S1	The above litigation contingency accrual does not include accrued expenses related to worker's compensation, automobile, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense.
58492_17_ITEM15_P325_S2	However, any litigation expense associated with these categories is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM15_P325_S3	For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Note H on page 92.
58492_17_ITEM15_P326_S0	We have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, and to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
58492_17_ITEM15_P326_S1	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current known facts, that additional losses, if any, are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_17_ITEM15_P326_S2	However, based upon current known facts, as of December 31, 2016, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable, and therefore not recorded) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $26 , including approximately $21 for Brazilian VAT matters disclosed above and $5 for other matters.
58492_17_ITEM15_P326_S3	If our assumptions or analyses regarding these contingencies are incorrect, or if facts change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals, and even greater than our estimate of reasonably possible losses in excess of recorded accruals.
58492_17_ITEM15_P327_S0	All below amounts are shown pretax.
58492_17_ITEM15_P328_S0	Second quarter 2016 Earnings from continuing operations include a gain of $7 associated with litigation accruals (Note S); $11 gain associated with the sale of a business; and a $4 charge from CVP impairment (Note C) 2.

58492_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Leggett Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901.
58492_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, automobiles and aircraft.
58492_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	As discussed below, our operations are organized into 14 business units, which are divided into ten groups under our four segments: Residential Products; Industrial Products; Furniture Products; and Specialized Products.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our Residential Products segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coil bedsprings.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	Today, we supply a variety of components and machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S3	We also produce or distribute carpet cushion, fabric, and geo components.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S4	Innovative proprietary products and low cost have made us the largest U.S. manufacturer in many of these businesses.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S5	We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting end-consumer needs.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S6	We attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, purchasing leverage, and large-scale production.
58492_18_ITEM1_P1_S7	Sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.
58492_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	1 Drawn Wire includes our former Wire Products business unit effective January 1, 2018.
58492_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	The quality of our products and service, together with low cost, have made Leggett Platt the leading U.S. supplier of high-carbon drawn steel wire.
58492_18_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our Wire Group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_18_ITEM1_P3_S2	We have three wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses.
58492_18_ITEM1_P3_S3	We also supply steel wire to trade customers that operate in a broad range of markets.
58492_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	C USTOMERS We use about 70% of our wire output to manufacture our own products, including:
58492_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Industrial Products segment also has a diverse group of trade customers that include:
58492_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	1 Home Furniture includes our former Furniture Hardware and Seating Distribution business units effective January 1, 2018.
58492_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	2 Consumer Products includes our former Adjustable Bed and Fashion Bed business units effective January 1, 2018.
58492_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	In our Furniture Products segment, we design, manufacture, and distribute a wide range of components and finished products for the residential furniture, office and commercial furniture, and specialty bedding markets.
58492_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	We supply components used by home and work furniture manufacturers to provide comfort, motion and style in their finished products, as well as select lines of private-label finished furniture.
58492_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	We are also a major supplier of adjustable beds and fashion beds, with domestic manufacturing, distribution, e-commerce fulfillment and global sourcing capabilities.
58492_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	1 Formed January 31, 2018, with the acquisition of a manufacturer of hydraulic cylinders.
58492_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our Specialized Products segment designs, manufactures and sells products including automotive seating components, tubing and fabricated assemblies for the aerospace industry, and hydraulic cylinders for the material handling, construction and transportation industries.
58492_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our technical capability and deep customer engagement allows us to compete on critical functionality, such as comfort, size, weight and noise.
58492_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our reliable product development and launch capability, coupled with our global footprint, makes us a trusted partner for our Tier 1 and OEM customers.
58492_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	For information about sales to trade customers, sales by product line, EBIT, and total assets of each of our segments, refer to Note E on page 82 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	In conjunction with the change in executive officers, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed effective January 1, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	As a result, the composition of our four segments also changed to reflect the new structure.
58492_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	The new segment structure is largely the same as prior years except the Home Furniture Group moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products (formerly Commercial Products) and the Machinery Group moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products.
58492_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	In addition, the changes in LIFO reserve are now recognized within the segments to which they relate (primarily Industrial Products).
58492_18_ITEM1_P12_S1	Previously segment EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) reflected the FIFO basis of accounting for certain inventories and an adjustment to the LIFO basis for these inventories was made at the consolidated financial statement level.
58492_18_ITEM1_P12_S2	These changes were retrospectively applied to all periods presented.
58492_18_ITEM1_P12_S3	The methods and assumptions that we use in estimating our LIFO reserve did not change.
58492_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price.
58492_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through an approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth.
58492_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers).
58492_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	For information about our TSR targets and performance see the discussion under " Total Shareholder Return " in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 28 .
58492_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	During the past three years, we generated $1.36 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
58492_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions.
58492_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	After funding those priorities, if there is still cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock.
58492_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	For information about dividends and share repurchases see the discussion under "Pay Dividends" and "Repurchase Stock" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 44 .
58492_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow.
58492_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest).
58492_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as business unit return, growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBIT margin, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and operating cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets.
58492_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, improve market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital.
58492_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital.
58492_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
58492_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	We revised our TSR framework in 2016 to moderately increase the expected long-term contribution from revenue growth to 6-9% (from 4-5% previously).
58492_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Over the last three years, the Company has generated combined unit volume and acquisition growth of 5% per year on average, but this growth was partially offset by divestitures, commodity deflation and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Our long-term 6-9% annual revenue growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing TSR; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess annual revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for bolt-on businesses: generally possess annual revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.
58492_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	On January 31, 2018, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders (PHC), a leading global manufacturer of engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market.
58492_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	The purchase price was $85 million.
58492_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	This business has current annual revenues of $81 million and represents a new growth platform for the Company.
58492_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	PHC serves a market of mainly large OEM customers utilizing highly engineered, co-designed components with long product life-cycles, yet representing a small percentage of the end product s cost.
58492_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	PHC will form a new business group titled Hydraulic Cylinders and report in the Specialized Products segment.
58492_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration (including cash and stock) of $56 million.
58492_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The first was a Canadian geosynthetic products distributor and installer for civil engineering and construction applications.
58492_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	The second was a Michigan-based surface-critical bent tube manufacturer supporting our private-label seating strategy in Work Furniture.
58492_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	We also acquired a North Carolina manufacturer of rebond carpet cushion.
58492_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	Finally, we acquired the remaining 20% ownership in an Asian joint venture in our Work Furniture business.
58492_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	We acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration of $65 million.
58492_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	The first was a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies.
58492_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	This business further expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities, and also adds precision machining to our aerospace platform.
58492_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	We also acquired a distributor of geosynthetic products and a South African producer of mattress innersprings.
58492_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	Finally, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China.
58492_18_ITEM1_P29_S4	This business manufactures seat comfort products and lumbar support systems.
58492_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	We acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture.
58492_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	The initial cash outlay for the 70% interest was $12 million and, per the terms of the agreement, we will acquire the remaining 30% in two equal parts, in the second quarters of 2018 and 2020.
58492_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	We have recorded a liability of approximately $14 million for these future payments.
58492_18_ITEM1_P30_S4	The recorded liability is based upon estimates and may fluctuate significantly until the payment dates.
58492_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	For more information regarding our acquisitions, please refer to Note Q on page 110 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	We divested our final Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) business for total consideration of $9 million.
58492_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	This business unit was engaged in the manufacture of van interiors, including the racks, shelving and cabinets installed in service vans.
58492_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	We divested four businesses for net consideration of $72 million.
58492_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	We sold two wire operations, one that manufactured wire partitions, perimeter guarding and storage lockers, and another that manufactured automatic wire strapping equipment and related consumable wire products.
58492_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	We also sold a CVP operation that designed and assembled docking stations for mobile computing equipment in vehicles.
58492_18_ITEM1_P34_S3	Finally, we sold a Machinery business that assembled industrial sewing machines.
58492_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	We sold four operations for total consideration of $36 million.
58492_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	We sold our final two Store Fixtures operations and a small operation within our CVP business.
58492_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	We also sold our Steel Tubing business unit.
58492_18_ITEM1_P35_S3	This business manufactured welded steel tubing and fabricated tube components.
58492_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 77 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	The percentages of our trade sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.
58492_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	The percentages of foreign trade sales were 31% for 2015, 34% for 2016 and 37% for 2017.
58492_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our international operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico.
58492_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our products in these foreign locations primarily consist of:
58492_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for our components is growing.
58492_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	We have also expanded internationally in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas to supply them more efficiently.
58492_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country.
58492_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 85% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks.
58492_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.
58492_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2017, we had 121 manufacturing facilities; 73 located in the U.S. and 48 located in 17 foreign countries, as shown below.
58492_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	We also had various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	For further information concerning our trade sales related to products manufactured, and our tangible long-lived assets located outside the United States, refer to Note E on page 82 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The following table shows our approximate percentage of trade sales by product line for the last three years:
58492_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	1 Certain operations in the Wire Group were sold in 2016.
58492_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	The two remaining Commercial Vehicle Products operations were sold in 2017 and 2016.
58492_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	The Steel Tubing Group was sold in 2015.
58492_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel.
58492_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors.
58492_18_ITEM1_P46_S2	We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
58492_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials.
58492_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use.
58492_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make.
58492_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:
58492_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill.
58492_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.
58492_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships.
58492_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	In 2017, our largest customer accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenues.
58492_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 33% of these consolidated revenues.
58492_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer s sales are reported, including our Residential Products, Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments.
58492_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations as of December 31, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations as a whole.
58492_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	Substantially all of our patents relate to products manufactured by the Residential Products, Furniture Products, and Specialized Products segments, while nearly half of our trademarks relate to products manufactured by the Residential Products segment.
58492_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	We had 1,382 patents issued and 584 in process, and 1,021 trademarks registered and 223 in process.
58492_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Some of our most significant trademarks include:
58492_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	One of our strongest performing product categories across the company is ComfortCore , our fabric-encased innerspring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses.
58492_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our ComfortCore volume continues to grow, and represented 40% of our total innerspring units by the end of 2017.
58492_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	A growing number of our ComfortCore innersprings contain a feature we call Quantum Edge.
58492_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	These are narrow-diameter, fabric-encased coils that form a perimeter around a ComfortCore innerspring set, replacing foam in a finished mattress.
58492_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	Over 30% of our ComfortCore innersprings have the Quantum Edge feature, and the volume of ComfortCore with Quantum Edge continues to grow.
58492_18_ITEM1_P55_S2	We are investing in capacity and adding machinery, supplied by our Spuhl operation, to support the growth in ComfortCore and Quantum Edge.
58492_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Most of our other businesses are engaged in product development activities to protect our market position and support ongoing growth.
58492_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	We maintain research, development and testing centers in many locations around the world.
58492_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas.
58492_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	However, we estimate our annual cost of research and development to be $25 million each year over the last three years.
58492_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 22,200 employees, of which 16,300 were engaged in production.
58492_18_ITEM1_P58_S1	Of the 22,200, approximately 12,700 were international employees (6,400 in China).
58492_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Approximately 15% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues.
58492_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	We did not experience any work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2017.
58492_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2018.
58492_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	We had approximately 7,900 employees in Specialized Products; 6,400 in Residential Products; 5,700 in Furniture Products; and 1,400 in Industrial Products.
58492_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 21,300 employees.
58492_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell.
58492_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive.
58492_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	We tend to attract and retain customers through innovation, product quality, competitive pricing and customer service.
58492_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well.
58492_18_ITEM1_P62_S4	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:
58492_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_18_ITEM1_P65_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	For information about antidumping duty orders regarding innerspring and steel wire rod imports, please see "Competition" in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 29 .
58492_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality.
58492_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and divestitures, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses.
58492_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Historically, our operating cash flows are stronger in the fourth quarter primarily related to the timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors.
58492_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments.
58492_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
58492_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	For information regarding working capital items, please see the discussion of " Cash from Operations " in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 40 .
58492_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.
58492_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment.
58492_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws.
58492_18_ITEM1_P72_S2	While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.

58492_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Investing in our securities involves risk.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Costs of raw materials could negatively affect our profit margins and earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Raw material cost increases (and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases) can significantly impact our earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; therefore, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Inability to recover cost increases (or a delay in the recovery time) can negatively impact our earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	through reduced selling prices to our customers.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Reduced selling prices combined with higher cost inventory can reduce our segment margins and earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	This volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in past years.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If market conditions cause scrap costs and rod pricing to change at different rates (both in terms of timing and amount), metal margins could be compressed and this would negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Higher raw material costs in past years led some of our customers to modify their product designs, changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In some cases, higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	This primarily impacted our Residential Products product mix and decreased profit margins.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If this were to occur again it could negatively impact our results of operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Competition could adversely affect our market share, sales, profit margins and earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We operate in markets that are highly competitive.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from Asia and Europe.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If we are unable to purchase key raw materials, such as steel, at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers, our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are exposed to litigation contingencies that, if realized, could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Although we deny liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings and believe that we have valid bases to contest all claims made against us, we have, at December 31, 2017, an aggregate litigation contingency accrual of $.4 million.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Based on current facts and circumstances, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable) losses in excess of the recorded accruals for litigation contingencies (which include Brazilian VAT and other matters) are estimated to be $22 million.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If our assumptions or analysis regarding these contingencies is incorrect, or if facts and circumstances change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals (and in excess of the $22 million referenced above) which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	For more information regarding our legal contingencies, please see Note S on page 115 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We are exposed to foreign currency risk which may negatively impact our competitiveness, profit margins and earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales, which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In 2017, 37% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies; however, certain of our operations experience currency-related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Further, our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment which could negatively impact our earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	At December 31, 2017, goodwill and other intangible assets represented $991 million, or 28% of our total assets.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, net property, plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled $793 million, or 22% of total assets.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in June as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In addition, we test for the recoverability of long-lived assets at year end, and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which would negatively impact our earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	For more information regarding potential goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment, please refer to Note C on page 79 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We rely on information systems to obtain, process, analyze and manage data, as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We receive, process and ship orders, manage the billing of and collections from our customers, and manage the accounting for and payment to our vendors.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We transitioned certain corporate-level shared service systems primarily related to our U.S. operations for general ledger, cash application, purchasing and accounts payable disbursements to a new platform during the first quarter of 2017.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Technology failures or security breaches of a new or existing infrastructure could create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If this occurs, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities will not compromise our technology protecting information systems.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time, then our results of operations could be adversely affected.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Economic uncertainty or a reduction in the amount of taxable income or a change in the source of taxable income could impact our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products which may negatively impact our sales, operating cash flows and earnings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	As a supplier of products to a variety of industries, we are adversely affected by general economic downturns.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	To a lesser extent, market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors, including disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover and interest rates.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	drive demand for our components and products.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders, sales and earnings in our businesses.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Several factors, including a weak global economy, low consumer confidence, or a depressed housing market could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If economic and market conditions deteriorate, we may experience material negative impacts on our business, financial condition, operating cash flows and results of operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We are exposed to political, regulatory, and legislative risks that may arise from actions by U.S. or foreign governments that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In 2017, 37% of our sales were generated by international operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Further, many of our businesses obtain products, components and raw materials from global suppliers.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, regulatory, and legislative risks inherent in operating in numerous countries.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	These regulations and laws are complex and may change.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	If the U.S. or foreign governments adopt or change regulations, this could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax positions could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject to the tax laws and reporting rules of the U.S. (federal, state and local) and several foreign jurisdictions.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Current economic and political conditions make these tax rules (and governmental interpretation of these rules) in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change and uncertainty.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	There have been proposals, most notably by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, to reform tax laws or change interpretations of existing tax rules.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Some of these proposals, if adopted, could significantly impact how multinational corporations are taxed on their earnings and transactions.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will become law, or how they might be interpreted, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), resulting in significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law, including the reduction of the statutory federal income tax rate for corporations and the transition from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We are continuing to assess the extensive changes under this legislation and its overall impact on the Company.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Based on our current understanding, we expect TCJA to reduce our tax rate in future periods.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	However, this expectation is based on our current knowledge of the legislation and assumptions we have made.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Recognized impacts could differ materially from current estimates based on additional analysis, changes in our interpretation of certain aspects of the legislation, actual financial results for 2018, additional regulatory guidance that might be issued, and other factors, including actions the Company may take as a result of TCJA.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Business disruptions to our steel rod mill, if coupled with an inability to purchase an adequate and/or timely supply of quality steel rod from alternative sources, could have a material negative impact on our Residential Products and Industrial Products segments and Company results of operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We purchase steel scrap from third party suppliers.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	This scrap is converted into steel rod in our mill in Sterling, Illinois.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Our steel rod mill has annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, a substantial majority of which is used by our three wire mills.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our wire mills convert the steel rod into drawn steel wire.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This wire is used in the production of many of our products, including mattress innersprings.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	A disruption to the operation of, or supply of steel scrap to, our steel rod mill could require us to purchase steel rod from alternative supply sources, subject to market availability.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Ongoing trade action by domestic rod producers against several foreign suppliers could result in the imposition of additional duties on steel rod imports which could result in reduced market availability and/or higher cost of steel rod.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we experience a disruption to our ability to produce steel rod in our mill, coupled with a reduction of adequate and/or timely supply from alternative market sources of quality steel rod, we could experience a material negative impact on our Residential Products and Industrial Products segments and Company results of operations.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Inability to identify and consummate acquisitions at a sufficient rate and at appropriate prices could negatively impact our annual revenue growth rate.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our long-term 6-9% annual revenue growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We expect to continue our strategy of seeking acquisitions that have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, are in a growing market, and create value by enhancing total shareholder return.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Our ability to grow revenues at 6-9% depends, in part, upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire these businesses at appropriate prices.
58492_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Because of competition among prospective buyers which often leads to higher valuations, the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions or obtain antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms, and accounting, regulatory and tax requirements, we may not be able to identify or consummate these acquisitions at a sufficient rate, which could adversely impact our annual revenue growth rate.
58492_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Company s corporate office is located in Carthage, Missouri.
58492_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	As of December 31, 2017 we had 121 manufacturing locations, of which 73 are located across the United States and 48 are located in 17 foreign countries.
58492_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also had various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities.
58492_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.
58492_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	For more information regarding the geographic location of our manufacturing facilities refer to Geographic Areas of Operation under Item 1 Business on page 11 .
58492_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	In 2017, 69% of the Company's net sales were produced in these owned facilities.
58492_18_ITEM2_P2_S1	We also lease many of our manufacturing, warehouse and other facilities on terms that vary by lease (including purchase options, renewals and maintenance costs).
58492_18_ITEM2_P2_S2	For additional information regarding lease obligations, see Note J on page 92 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM2_P3_S0	Of our 121 manufacturing facilities, none are subject to liens or encumbrances that are material to the segment in which they are reported or to the Company as a whole.
58492_18_ITEM2_P4_S0	None of our physical properties are, by themselves, material to the Company s overall manufacturing processes, except for our steel rod mill in Sterling, Illinois, which is reported in Industrial Products.
58492_18_ITEM2_P4_S1	The rod mill consists of approximately 1 million square feet of production space, which we own, and has annual output of approximately 500,000 tons of steel rod, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills.
58492_18_ITEM2_P5_S0	Our wire mills convert the steel rod into drawn steel wire.
58492_18_ITEM2_P5_S1	This wire is used in the production of many of our products, including mattress innersprings.
58492_18_ITEM2_P6_S0	A disruption to the operation of, or supply of steel scrap to, our steel rod mill could require us to purchase steel rod from alternative supply sources, subject to market availability.
58492_18_ITEM2_P6_S1	Ongoing trade action by domestic rod producers against several foreign suppliers could result in the imposition of additional duties on steel rod imports which could result in reduced market availability and/or the increase in our cost of steel rod.
58492_18_ITEM2_P6_S2	If we experience a disruption to our ability to produce steel rod in our mill, coupled with a reduction of adequate and/or timely supply from alternative market sources of quality steel rod, we could experience a material negative impact on our Residential Products and Industrial Products segments and Company results of operations.
58492_18_ITEM2_P7_S0	In the opinion of management, the Company s owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate for the manufacture, assembly and distribution of our products.
58492_18_ITEM2_P7_S1	Our properties are located to allow quick and efficient delivery of products and services to our diverse customer base.
58492_18_ITEM2_P8_S0	In certain businesses, productive capacity continues to exceed current operating levels.
58492_18_ITEM2_P8_S1	However, utilization has increased in many of our businesses with improving market demand, and we are investing to support growth in several of our businesses, including Automotive, U.S. Spring, European Spring and Adjustable Bed.

58492_18_ITEM4_P11_S2	She has served the Company in a series of progressively more responsible accounting capacities since 1998.
58492_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol LEG).
58492_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The table below highlights quarterly and annual stock market information for the last two years.
58492_18_ITEM5_P2_S0	(1) Price and volume data reflect composite transactions; price range reflects intra-day prices; data source is Bloomberg.
58492_18_ITEM5_P3_S0	As of February 9, 2018, we had 8,497 shareholders of record.
58492_18_ITEM5_P4_S0	Increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_18_ITEM5_P4_S1	In 2017, we increased the quarterly dividend by $.02, or 6% to $.36 per share.
58492_18_ITEM5_P4_S2	In each year for over 25 years, we have generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.
58492_18_ITEM5_P4_S3	We expect this again to be the case in 2018.
58492_18_ITEM5_P4_S4	We have no restrictions that materially limit our ability to pay such dividends or that we reasonably believe are likely to limit the future payment of dividends.
58492_18_ITEM5_P5_S0	For more information on dividends see "Pay Dividends" in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 44 .
58492_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	The table below is a listing of our purchases of the Company s common stock during each calendar month of the fourth quarter of 2017.
58492_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	(1) This number includes 8,941 shares which were not repurchased as part of a publicly announced plan or program, all of which were shares surrendered in transactions permitted under the Company s benefit plans.
58492_18_ITEM5_P7_S1	It does not include shares withheld for taxes on option exercises and stock unit conversions, or forfeitures of stock units, all of which totaled 11,852 shares for the fourth quarter.
58492_18_ITEM5_P7_S2	(2) On August 4, 2004, the Board authorized management to repurchase up to 10 million shares each calendar year beginning January 1, 2005.
58492_18_ITEM5_P7_S3	This standing authorization was first reported in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2004, filed August 5, 2004, and will remain in force until repealed by the Board of Directors.
58492_18_ITEM5_P7_S4	As such, effective January 1, 2018, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 10 million shares in 2018.
58492_18_ITEM5_P7_S5	No specific repurchase schedule has been established.
58492_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	All amounts are presented after tax.
58492_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2017 includes a $50 million charge associated with the TCJA; $13 million of net gains on sales of a business and real estate; an $8 million tax benefit from a divestiture; a $10 million pension settlement charge; and a $3 million charge for an impairment of a wire business.
58492_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2016 includes $16 million of gains on sales of businesses; a $3 million goodwill impairment charge; and a $5 million gain on a foam litigation settlement.
58492_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	Discontinued operations primarily consists of a gain on a foam litigation settlement.
58492_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2015 includes $4 million of impairments; $3 million associated with litigation accruals; and an $8 million pension settlement charge.
58492_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2014 includes $33 million associated with litigation accruals.
58492_18_ITEM6_P3_S1	Discontinued Operations includes the following items: $93 million goodwill impairment; $5 million loss on the sale of the majority of our Store Fixtures unit; and $22 million associated with litigation accruals.
58492_18_ITEM6_P4_S0	Net earnings from Continuing Operations for 2013 include charges of $45 million related to the Commercial Vehicle Products group ($43 million goodwill impairment charge and $2 million accelerated amortization of a customer-related intangible asset); and an $8 million bargain purchase gain related to an acquisition.
58492_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Sales increased 5% in 2017, from growth in volume, raw material-related price inflation and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Acquisitions added 2% to sales but were offset by divestitures (-2%).
58492_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	Sales growth came primarily from Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, and Adjustable Bed.
58492_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	Several other businesses, including International Spring, Geo Components, Work Furniture and Aerospace, contributed to sales growth this past year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Earnings from continuing operations decreased significantly from the effects of one-time costs associated with the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
58492_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Other significant factors that reduced earnings include on going steel inflation and the timing lag associated with passing along higher steel costs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	These reductions were partially offset by increased sales and lower income taxes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	We continue to optimize our portfolio by increasing investment in those businesses that possess strong competitive advantage and reducing our exposure to businesses and markets that are less attractive.
58492_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	We increased capital expenditures in 2017 to support product categories that are growing.
58492_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	In addition, we acquired three small businesses.
58492_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	We also divested the last remaining operation within the Commercial Vehicle Products group during the year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Operating cash flow decreased versus 2016, primarily from higher working capital due to sales growth and inflation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	However, we once again generated more than enough operating cash flow to comfortably fund dividends and capital expenditures, something we have accomplished each year for more than 25 years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	We raised the quarterly dividend by 6% in 2017 and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	We also bought back 3.3 million shares of our stock.
58492_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	During the year, we issued $500 million of 3.5% notes maturing in 2027.
58492_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	We also extended the term of, and expanded the borrowing capacity under, our revolving credit facility from $750 million to $800 million and correspondingly increased our commercial paper program.
58492_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	We ended 2017 with net debt to net capital at 33%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%, as discussed on page 47 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	We assess our overall performance by comparing our Total Shareholder Return (TSR) to that of peer companies on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We target TSR in the top third of the S P 500 over the long term.
58492_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	For the three years ended December 31, 2017, we generated TSR of 7% per year on average, placing us just below the midpoint of the S P 500.
58492_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	These topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
58492_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance.
58492_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	TSR is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay: TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends) / Beginning Stock Price.
58492_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	We seek to achieve TSR in the top third of the S P 500 over the long term through an approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.
58492_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We monitor our TSR performance relative to the S P 500 on a rolling three-year basis.
58492_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2017, we generated TSR of 7% per year on average, just below the midpoint of the S P 500.
58492_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The table below shows the components of our TSR targets.
58492_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Accomplishing this level of performance over rolling three-year periods should enable us to consistently attain our top-third TSR goal.
58492_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	We serve a broad suite of customers, with our largest customer representing approximately 5% of our sales.
58492_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	Many are companies whose names are widely recognized.
58492_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	They include producers of residential furniture and bedding, automotive and office seating manufacturers, and a variety of other companies.
58492_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Many factors impact our business, but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand, raw material cost trends, and competition.
58492_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Market demand (including product mix) is impacted by several economic factors, with consumer confidence being most significant.
58492_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Other important factors include disposable income levels, employment levels, housing turnover, and interest rates.
58492_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	All of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods, and therefore affect demand for our components and products.
58492_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment, which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales.
58492_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	In many of our businesses, we enjoy a cost advantage from being vertically integrated into steel wire and rod.
58492_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	This is a benefit that our competitors do not have.
58492_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	We also experience favorable purchasing leverage from buying large quantities of raw materials.
58492_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	Still, our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials (many of which are commodities) fluctuate.
58492_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	We typically have short-term commitments from our suppliers; accordingly, our raw material costs generally move with the market.
58492_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our ability to recover higher costs (through selling price increases) is crucial.
58492_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	When we experience significant increases in raw material costs, we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Conversely, when costs decrease significantly, we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers.
58492_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	The timing of our price increases or decreases is important; we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs, and we also realize a lag as costs decline.
58492_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Steel is our principal raw material.
58492_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	At various times in past years we have experienced significant cost fluctuations in this commodity.
58492_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	In most cases, the major changes (both increases and decreases) were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Throughout 2015, market prices for steel decreased significantly, leading to downward pressure on selling prices.
58492_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	We realized a beneficial pricing lag during 2015, as costs generally decreased at a faster rate than selling prices.
58492_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	In 2016, steel costs once again became volatile.
58492_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Steel inflation during the first half of 2016 was followed by deflation in the third quarter, and significant inflation late in the year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	This steel inflation continued throughout 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P17_S5	We implemented price increases to recover most of the higher costs, but with the normal lag in realizing selling price increases, the cost inflation led to margin pressure throughout 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	As a producer of steel rod, we are also impacted by changes in metal margins (the difference between the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod).
58492_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Metal margins within the steel industry have been volatile in past years, were moderately compressed in late 2016, and began to increase modestly in the second half of 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our other raw materials include woven and non-woven fabrics, foam scrap, and chemicals.
58492_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	We have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in past years and generally have been able to pass them through to our customers.
58492_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	When we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs, this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components.
58492_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	We must continue providing product options to our customers that enable them to improve the functionality of their products and manage their costs, while providing higher profits for our operations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Many of our markets are highly competitive, with the number of competitors varying by product line.
58492_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.
58492_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	Many of our competitors, both domestic and foreign, compete primarily on the basis of price.
58492_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	Our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive, while delivering innovation, better product quality, and customer service.
58492_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore.
58492_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates.
58492_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	We typically remain price competitive in most of our business units, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities.
58492_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.
58492_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued.
58492_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).
58492_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	An antidumping and countervailing duty case filed in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers was concluded in December 2014, resulting in the imposition of duties on imports of Chinese steel wire rod.
58492_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	antidumping duties range from 106% to 110% and the countervailing duties range from 178% to 193%.
58492_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	Both remain in effect through December 2019.
58492_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Also, in March 2017 certain U.S. steel wire rod producers filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions on imports of steel wire rod from Belarus, Italy, Korea, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.
58492_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	The ITC and the DOC have made final affirmative determinations and imposed antidumping duties on imports from Belarus (280%), Russia (437% to 757%), South Africa (135% to 142%), Ukraine (35% to 44%), and United Arab Emirates (84%).
58492_18_ITEM7_P26_S4	Final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on the remaining countries are expected in March and April 2018.
58492_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett and several other U.S. manufacturers formed a coalition to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.
58492_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Congress passed the Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act.
58492_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The ENFORCE Act requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection to implement a transparent, time-limited process to investigate allegations of duty evasion and to assess duties where appropriate.
58492_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure.
58492_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	In conjunction with a change in executive officers, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed as of January 1, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	Effective January 1, 2017, Perry E. Davis became President of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segments, and J. Mitchell Dolloff became President of the Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	The composition of our four segments also changed effective January 1, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	The table below outlines the new segment structure.
58492_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The new structure is largely the same as in prior years except that the Home Furniture Group was moved from Residential Products (formerly Residential Furnishings) to Furniture Products (formerly Commercial Products), and the Machinery Group was moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products.
58492_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Industrial Products segment (formerly Industrial Materials) had no changes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Our final CVP operation was sold in 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Prior to January 1, 2017, all of our segments used the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for valuing inventory.
58492_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	In our consolidated financials, we converted approximately 50% of these inventories (primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories) to the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, and reported the related LIFO benefit or expense outside of the segments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Effective January 1, 2017, the LIFO benefit or expense was recognized within the segment to which it relates.
58492_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	This change has been retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.
58492_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Sales increased 5% in 2017, from growth in volume, raw material-related price inflation, and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	Acquisitions added 2% to sales but were offset by divestitures.
58492_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	Sales growth came primarily from Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, and Adjustable Bed.
58492_18_ITEM7_P32_S3	Several other businesses, including International Spring, Geo Components, Work Furniture and Aerospace, contributed to sales growth this year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Earnings from continuing operations decreased significantly from the effects of one-time costs associated with the recently enacted TCJA.
58492_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Other significant factors that reduced earnings include ongoing steel inflation and the timing lag associated with passing along higher steel costs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	These reductions were partially offset by increased sales and lower income taxes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2017, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Sales increased 5% from volume growth, raw-material price increases and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	Acquisitions also contributed 2% to sales growth but were offset by divestitures.
58492_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	The growth came primarily from Automotive and Adjustable Bed.
58492_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	Several other businesses, including International Spring, Geo Components, Work Furniture and Aerospace, also contributed to sales growth this past year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	During 2017, we divested the last remaining CVP operation, which had total annual sales of $43 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	As indicated in the table above, earnings from continuing operations decreased primarily from the impact of the recently enacted TCJA.
58492_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	Operationally, earnings decreased largely from steel inflation, the timing lag associated with passing along these higher steel costs, and several smaller items partially offset by higher volume and lower income taxes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Approximately 50% of our inventories are valued on the LIFO method.
58492_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	In 2017, increasing steel costs over the course of the year resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO expense of $19 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	In 2016, increasing steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO expense of $11 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Net interest expense in 2017 did not appreciably change.
58492_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Our tax rate is determined by a combination of items, some recurring and some discrete.
58492_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	Recurring items include income earned in various tax jurisdictions and differences in tax rates in those jurisdictions.
58492_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	These items tend to be relatively stable from year to year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	Conversely, discrete items may not be as consistent from year to year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law TCJA, enacting significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the transition of U.S. taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, and the imposition of a one-time tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of untaxed foreign earnings.
58492_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	Although these provisions are generally applicable for years after December 31, 2017, several impacted our 2017 earnings, including the one-time deemed repatriation tax, additional taxes for expected foreign cash repatriations, and the revaluation of our U.S. deferred taxes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	As a result, we recorded a net tax expense of $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to these items, which negatively impacted our full year tax rate by 12%.
58492_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	Of this total amount, $67 million is related to the one-time deemed repatriation tax that will be paid on a graduated scale over the next eight years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The amount recorded is our best estimate and based on our current understanding of TCJA and the guidance currently available, but should be considered provisional.
58492_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The ultimate impact may differ from the provisional amount and the accounting will be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.
58492_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	While the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 35% in both years, our worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 32% in 2017, compared to 25% for 2016.
58492_18_ITEM7_P44_S1	As discussed above, our rate was negatively impacted by 12% in 2017 due to the effect of TCJA (16% associated with the deemed repatriation tax and 2% from tax on expected future foreign cash repatriations, partially offset by a 6% benefit from the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities).
58492_18_ITEM7_P44_S2	In both years our tax rate benefited from earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 8% in 2017 and 6% in 2016.
58492_18_ITEM7_P44_S3	In addition, the 2017 tax rate benefited by 2% related to tax attributes from a divested business, 2% related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions in the year, and 3% from other permanent tax differences.
58492_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The 2016 tax rate benefited by 3% related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions in the year and 1% (net) from other items.
58492_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	We anticipate an effective tax rate for 2018 of approximately 22%, which includes the anticipated tax effects associated with TCJA and certain other expected discrete items, including stock compensation payments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	The expected tax impact from stock compensation can fluctuate based on stock price and other factors, and any changes to our 2017 provisional and 2018 expected TCJA amounts could impact our anticipated 2018 tax rate.
58492_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	Our tax rate is also contingent upon other factors such as our overall profitability, the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions, the type of income earned, business acquisitions and dispositions, the impact of tax audits and other discrete items, and the effect of other tax law changes and prudent tax planning strategies.
58492_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	In the following section we discuss 2017 sales and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) for each of our segments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 82 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	2016 segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment reporting discussed on page 30 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we operated one year earlier.
58492_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on trade sales.
58492_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Residential Products total sales increased 3% in 2017 from acquisitions, net of a small divestiture.
58492_18_ITEM7_P49_S1	Same locations sales were flat, with volume growth and raw material-related price increases offset by lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds (which originate in Furniture Products but are occasionally distributed through Residential Products).
58492_18_ITEM7_P49_S2	Within our U.S. Spring business, total innerspring units decreased 4%, but growth continued in ComfortCore (our pocketed coil innersprings), with unit volume in that category up 8%.
58492_18_ITEM7_P49_S3	Volume also increased in our International Spring business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2017 due to the pass-through of raw material cost increases and higher volume, despite the non-recurrence of a $7 million litigation benefit in 2016.
58492_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Total sales in the segment declined 6%, due to divestitures completed in 2016.
58492_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Same location sales in Industrial Products were flat with steel-related price increases offset by lower volume.
58492_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	EBIT decreased primarily from the non-recurrence of a $16 million divestiture gain in 2016, higher raw material costs (including LIFO expense), the timing lag associated with passing along inflation, an impairment charge of $5 million, and lower volume.
58492_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Sales in Furniture Products increased 6%, with same location sales up 5% from growth in Adjustable Bed and Work Furniture.
58492_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	A small acquisition in Work Furniture added 1% to sales growth.
58492_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, with the benefit from sales growth more than offset by higher steel costs (including LIFO expense), production inefficiencies and other smaller items.
58492_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	In Specialized Products, total sales increased 4% in 2017, and same location sales increased 8%, with volume gains in Automotive and Aerospace partially offset by lower sales in the former CVP business unit.
58492_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	CVP divestitures reduced sales by 4%.
58492_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased primarily from a $23 million gain related to the sale of real estate formerly associated with CVP and higher volume, partially offset by a non-recurring divestiture gain in 2016 ($11 million) and growth-related costs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, decreased to -$1 million from $19 million in 2016.
58492_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	This decrease is primarily due to the non-recurrence of a litigation gain ($20 million) related to our former Prime Foam business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Sales decreased 4% in 2016, with slightly higher unit volume and acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price deflation, and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Sales growth continued in Automotive, reflecting content gains and new program awards, but several other businesses experienced soft market demand and lower unit volume during the year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Earnings from continuing operations increased from several factors, including divestiture gains.
58492_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	The benefit from increased unit volume and lower income taxes was partially offset by steel inflation and the non-recurrence of a pricing lag benefit associated with deflation late in 2015.
58492_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	Further details about our consolidated and segment results are discussed below.
58492_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from continuing operations during 2016, and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Sales decreased 4%, with unit volume growth and acquisitions more than offset by divestitures, raw material-related price decreases, and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	Strong growth in Automotive was partially offset by soft demand in several other markets, including bedding and home furniture.
58492_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	During 2016, we divested two wire operations, a CVP business and a Machinery operation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	These businesses had total combined annual sales of approximately $100 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Operationally, earnings also benefited from higher unit volume and lower income taxes related to a new accounting standard for stock-based compensation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	These improvements were partially offset by steel inflation that began to occur in late 2016 and the non-recurrence of the prior year pricing lag benefit (that occurred as steel costs deflated in late 2015).
58492_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Approximately 50% of our inventories are valued on the LIFO method.
58492_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	These are primarily our domestic, steel-related inventories.
58492_18_ITEM7_P64_S2	In 2016, increasing steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO expense of $11 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P64_S3	In 2015, significant deflation in steel costs, particularly in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year pretax LIFO benefit of $46 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	For further discussion of inventories, see Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Net interest expense in 2016 decreased slightly due to the repayment of $200 million 5% notes in August 2015.
58492_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our tax rate is determined by a combination of items, some recurring and some discrete.
58492_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	Recurring items include things like income earned in various tax jurisdictions, and differences in tax rates in those jurisdictions.
58492_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	These items tend to be relatively stable from year to year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	Conversely, discrete items are things that may not be as consistent from year to year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	While the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate was 35% in both years, our worldwide effective income tax rate on continuing operations was 25% in 2016, compared to 27% for 2015.
58492_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	In both years our tax rate benefited from earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which reduced our effective tax rate by 6% in each year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	In addition, the 2016 tax rate benefited by 3% related to the tax effects of stock-based compensation deductions in the year, and 1% (net) from other items.
58492_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	The 2015 tax rate benefited by 1% related to the reduction of a tax accrual for Chinese earnings that we decided to reinvest within China to acquire the remaining interest in a joint venture and 1% (net) from other items.
58492_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	In the first quarter of 2016 we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
58492_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	This ASU provides that the tax effects of stock-based awards must be treated as discrete items affecting the tax rate in the interim reporting period in which the tax deductions occur.
58492_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	Many variables (such as timing of award settlements or expirations, changes in stock price over time, ultimate payout levels for awards with performance contingencies, shares cancelled before vesting, and the tax rules in effect at the time of settlement) will impact both the timing and the amount of the tax deductions.
58492_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	Thus, this ASU is likely to add more volatility to the effective tax rate of companies such as Leggett that use stock-based compensation plans.
58492_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	In the following section we discuss 2016 sales and EBIT for each of our segments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P70_S1	We provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment EBIT to consolidated EBIT in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 82 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	All segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the change in segment reporting discussed on page 30 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	(1) This is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures.
58492_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	These are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we operated one year earlier.
58492_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	(2) Segment margins are calculated on total sales.
58492_18_ITEM7_P72_S3	Overall company margin is calculated on trade sales.
58492_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Residential Products sales decreased 6% in 2016 from a combination of lower unit volume in several product categories, lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds (which originate in Furniture Products but are occasionally distributed through Residential Products), raw material-related price decreases, and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	Within our U.S. Spring business, total innerspring units decreased 6%, but growth continued in ComfortCore (our pocketed coil innersprings), with unit volume in that category up 4%.
58492_18_ITEM7_P73_S2	Volume also increased in our European Spring business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased in 2016 due to a litigation gain ($7 million) and non-recurrence of last year's foam litigation expense ($5 million).
58492_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Operationally, the impact on EBIT from lower unit volume was offset by pricing discipline.
58492_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	Same location sales in Industrial Products were down 12% from steel-related price decreases and lower unit volume in Drawn Wire.
58492_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	Total sales in the segment declined 25%, also reflecting the divestitures of the Steel Tubing business in late 2015 and two wire operations in 2016.
58492_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	EBIT decreased primarily due to higher raw material costs (including LIFO impact) and lower unit volume.
58492_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	The operational impacts were partially offset by a divestiture gain ($16 million) from the sale of one of the Wire Products operations, and the non-recurrence of the prior year's impairment charge ($6 million) and divestiture loss ($3 million), both associated with the sale of the Steel Tubing business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Sales in Furniture Products decreased 2%, primarily from lower volume in Home Furniture, steel-related price decreases, and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	These items were partially offset by growth from a Work Furniture acquisition completed in March 2015.
58492_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	Adjustable Bed unit volume increased 1% (versus strong growth in each of the prior two years) as we began ramping up new programs selling directly to major bedding retailers and transitioning away from former programs with bedding manufacturers.
58492_18_ITEM7_P77_S3	The decline in these bedding manufacturer programs also caused the decrease in pass-through sales of adjustable beds discussed in the Residential Products segment above.
58492_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin decreased, primarily from higher raw material costs (including LIFO impact) and lower volume, partially offset by operational improvements, gains from building sales of $3 million, and a favorable sales mix.
58492_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	In Specialized Products, sales increased 7% in 2016, with volume gains in Automotive and an Aerospace acquisition completed early in the year, partially offset by divestitures, and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	EBIT and EBIT margin increased from higher sales, a divestiture gain ($11 million) related to the sale of a CVP operation, and currency impact.
58492_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	These items were partially offset by goodwill impairment of $4 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	We agreed to sell real estate associated with the CVP business and expected to realize a gain on this transaction in 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	This property reached held-for-sale status in 2016, causing the fair value of the CVP reporting unit to fall below its carrying value, and triggering the $4 million impairment charge.
58492_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Full year earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax, increased to $19 million from $1 million in 2015.
58492_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	This increase is primarily due to a litigation gain ($20 million) related to our former Prime Foam business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	For further information about discontinued operations, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 77 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Cash from operations decreased in 2017, primarily from working capital increases due to sales growth and inflation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	Our operations once again provided more than enough cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments, something we have accomplished each year for over 25 years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P83_S2	We expect this to again be the case in 2018.
58492_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	We continued to invest in businesses and product categories that are growing.
58492_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	This resulted in higher capital expenditures in 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P84_S2	We raised the quarterly dividend by 6% and extended our record of consecutive annual increases to 46 years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P84_S3	We also bought back 3.3 million shares of our stock during the year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	In November 2017, we issued $500 million of 3.5% notes maturing in 2027.
58492_18_ITEM7_P85_S1	We also extended the term of our revolving credit facility to November 2022, expanded the borrowing capacity from $750 million to $800 million and correspondingly increased our commercial paper program.
58492_18_ITEM7_P85_S2	We ended 2017 with net debt to net capital at 33%, comfortably within our long-standing targeted range of 30-40%, as discussed on page 47 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	Cash from operations is our primary source of funds.
58492_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	Earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Cash from operations decreased in 2017 primarily from working capital increases due to sales growth and inflation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	Cash from operations should approximate $500 million in 2018, with working capital expected to be a smaller use of cash than in 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	We closely monitor our working capital levels, and we ended 2017 with adjusted working capital at 10.6% of annualized sales 1 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P88_S1	The table below explains this non-GAAP calculation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	We eliminate cash and current debt maturities from working capital to monitor our operating efficiency and performance related to trade receivables, inventories, and accounts payable.
58492_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	We believe this provides a more useful measurement to investors since cash and current maturities can fluctuate significantly from period to period.
58492_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	As discussed on page 48 , a substantial amount of our cash is held by international operations and may not be immediately available to reduce debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
58492_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Annualized sales equal 4th quarter sales ($984 million in 2017 and $904 million in 2016) multiplied by 4.
58492_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	We believe measuring our working capital against this sales metric is more useful, since efficient management of working capital includes adjusting those net asset levels to reflect current business volume.
58492_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Calculations of days are as follows: 1.
58492_18_ITEM7_P92_S1	Days sales outstanding: ((beginning of year trade receivables + end of year trade receivables) 2) (net trade sales number of days in the year).
58492_18_ITEM7_P92_S2	2. Days inventory on hand: ((beginning of year inventory + end of year inventory) 2) (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_18_ITEM7_P92_S3	Days payables outstanding: ((beginning of year accounts payable + end of year accounts payable) 2) (cost of goods sold number of days in the year).
58492_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	Trade Receivables - Our trade receivables increased $71 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased sales and currency fluctuations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P93_S1	Our sales to international customers, which are predominantly in the Specialized Products segment, continue to increase and typically have longer payment terms.
58492_18_ITEM7_P93_S2	We continue to look for ways to improve speed of customer payments, including third party programs with early payment incentives in certain circumstances.
58492_18_ITEM7_P94_S0	Our provision for losses on accounts receivable has averaged $2 million, and our allowance for bad debt as a percentage of our net receivables has averaged 2% for the last three years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P94_S1	We have experienced favorable trends in the number of accounts monitored for possible loss or written off in the last few years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P94_S2	We obtain credit applications, credit reports, bank and trade references, and periodic financial statements from our customers to establish credit limits and terms as appropriate.
58492_18_ITEM7_P94_S3	In cases where a customer s payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves when deemed necessary.
58492_18_ITEM7_P95_S0	Inventories - The increase in inventories of $51 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily reflects higher levels necessary to support sales growth and meet customer delivery requirements, and higher raw material costs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P96_S0	Days inventory on hand of 65 days at the end of 2017 is within a reasonable historical range.
58492_18_ITEM7_P96_S1	We believe we have established adequate reserves for any slower moving or obsolete inventories.
58492_18_ITEM7_P96_S2	We continuously monitor our slow-moving and potentially obsolete inventory through reports on inventory quantities compared to usage within the previous 120 days.
58492_18_ITEM7_P96_S3	We also utilize cycle counting programs and complete physical counts of our inventory.
58492_18_ITEM7_P96_S4	When potential inventory obsolescence is indicated by these controls, we will take charges for write-downs to maintain an adequate level of reserves.
58492_18_ITEM7_P96_S5	We have averaged inventory obsolescence charges of $8 million annually for the last three years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P96_S6	Our reserve balances (not including our LIFO reserves) as a percentage of our year-end inventory were 6% at the end of 2017, which is consistent with our historical average.
58492_18_ITEM7_P97_S0	Accounts Payable - The increase in accounts payables of $79 million at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased purchases to support sales growth, a focused effort on optimizing payment terms, and currency fluctuations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P97_S1	We continue to optimize payment terms through our significant purchasing power and also utilize third party services that allow flexible payment options to enhance our DPO.
58492_18_ITEM7_P98_S0	Cash is readily available to fund growth.
58492_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	In certain of our businesses and product lines we have minimal excess production capacity, and we are therefore investing to support continued growth.
58492_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	In Automotive, we are expanding capacity to support new programs that will begin production over the next few years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	In Bedding, we are investing in equipment to support ongoing growth in ComfortCore innersprings and newer product features such as Quantum Edge.
58492_18_ITEM7_P99_S3	We are also investing to support rapid growth in Adjustable Bed.
58492_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	We will continue to make investments to support expansion in businesses and product lines where sales are growing, and for efficiency improvement and maintenance.
58492_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	We expect capital expenditures to again approximate $160 million in 2018.
58492_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	Our employee incentive plans emphasize returns on capital, which include net fixed assets and working capital.
58492_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	This emphasis focuses our management on asset utilization and helps ensure that we are investing additional capital dollars where attractive return potential exists.
58492_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	In some of our businesses, we have capacity to accommodate additional volume.
58492_18_ITEM7_P102_S1	For each $10 million of sales from incremental unit volume produced utilizing spare capacity, we expect to generate approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million of additional pretax earnings.
58492_18_ITEM7_P102_S2	The earnings and margin improvement that we have realized over the past few years reflects, in part, higher utilization in our businesses from market share gains and higher market demand.
58492_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Our long-term 6-9% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions.
58492_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	We are seeking acquisitions primarily within our Grow business units, and we are looking for opportunities to enter new growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage).
58492_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	In 2015, we acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture for an initial cash outlay of $12 million and will acquire the remaining 30% in two equal parts, in the second quarters of 2018 and 2020, respectively, for a currently estimated amount of $14 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P103_S3	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	In 2016, we acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration of $65 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	capabilities and adds precision machining to our aerospace platform.
58492_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	The second is a distributor of geosynthetic products, and the third, a South African producer of mattress innersprings.
58492_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Finally, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China.
58492_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	This business manufactures seat comfort products and lumbar support systems.
58492_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	In 2017, we acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration of $56 million (cash and stock).
58492_18_ITEM7_P106_S1	The first, a Canadian distributor and installer of geosynthetic products expands the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P106_S2	The second is a U.S. manufacturer of surface-critical bent tube components which supports the private-label finished seating strategy in our Work Furniture business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P106_S3	The third is a U.S. producer of rebond carpet underlay which adds to our production capacity and expands the geographic footprint in our Carpet Cushion business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P106_S4	Finally, we acquired the remaining 20% of an Asian joint venture in our Work Furniture business.
58492_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Additional details about acquisitions can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 110 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	Increasing the dividend remains a high priority.
58492_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	In 2017, we increased the quarterly dividend by $.02, or 6%, to $.36 per share.
58492_18_ITEM7_P108_S2	This extended our record of consecutive annual dividend increases to 46 years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P108_S3	Our targeted dividend payout ratio is 50-60% of continuing operations adjusted EPS (which exclude special items such as significant tax law impacts, divestiture gains, impairment charges, litigation accruals and settlement proceeds).
58492_18_ITEM7_P108_S4	We expect future dividend growth to approximate earnings growth.
58492_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	As shown in the chart above, share repurchases were significant in each of the last three years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	During that time frame, we repurchased a total of 12.1 million shares of our stock and issued 6.2 million shares (through employee benefit plans and stock option exercises), reducing outstanding shares by 4%.
58492_18_ITEM7_P109_S2	In 2017, we repurchased 3.3 million shares (at an average price of $48.66) and issued 1.7 million shares.
58492_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	Our top priorities for uses of cash are organic growth (via capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions.
58492_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	After funding those priorities, to the extent there is remaining cash available, we generally intend to repurchase stock.
58492_18_ITEM7_P110_S2	We have been authorized by the Board to repurchase up to 10 million shares each year, but we have established no specific repurchase commitment or timetable.
58492_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	This table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	(1) These rates include current maturities, but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities.
58492_18_ITEM7_P112_S1	The rates also include amortization of interest rate swaps.
58492_18_ITEM7_P113_S0	(2) The unused credit amount is based upon our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program which, at the end of 2015, had $600 million of borrowing capacity.
58492_18_ITEM7_P113_S1	The credit facility was amended in the second quarter of 2016 to increase the borrowing capacity to $750 million and the commercial paper program was increased to a corresponding amount.
58492_18_ITEM7_P113_S2	The credit facility was amended again in the fourth quarter of 2017 to increase the borrowing capacity to $800 million and the commercial paper program was increased to a corresponding amount.
58492_18_ITEM7_P114_S0	(3) Fixed charges include interest expense, capitalized interest, plus implied interest included in operating leases.
58492_18_ITEM7_P115_S0	Earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed charges.
58492_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	The next table shows the ratio of long-term debt to total capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016, calculated in two ways:
58492_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	Long-term debt and total capitalization as reported in the previous table.
58492_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	Long-term debt and total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long-term debt.
58492_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	We believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more useful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly.
58492_18_ITEM7_P119_S1	We use these adjusted (non-GAAP) measures as supplemental information to track leverage trends across time periods with variable levels of cash.
58492_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	Our long-term target is to have net debt as a percentage of net capital in the 30-40% range.
58492_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	As discussed on page 48 , a substantial amount of cash is held by our international operations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P121_S1	Therefore, we may not be able to use all of our cash to reduce our debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis, as reflected in the net debt to net capital ratio.
58492_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	Total debt (which includes long-term debt and current debt maturities) increased $292 million in 2017, primarily from the $500 million debt issuance described below, partially offset by a reduction in commercial paper.
58492_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	In November 2017, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes that mature in 2027.
58492_18_ITEM7_P123_S1	The notes bear interest at a rate of 3.5% per year, with interest payable semi-annually beginning on May 15, 2018.
58492_18_ITEM7_P123_S2	The net proceeds of these notes were used to pay down commercial paper, which in turn provided borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program for general corporate purposes and the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness, at maturity.
58492_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	We can raise cash by issuing commercial paper through a program that is backed by our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 14 lenders.
58492_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	In May 2016, we increased the borrowing capacity under the facility from $600 million to $750 million and extended the term by two years to 2021.
58492_18_ITEM7_P124_S2	In November 2017, we increased the borrowing capacity under the facility from $750 million to $800 million and extended the term by one year to 2022.
58492_18_ITEM7_P124_S3	The credit facility allows us to issue letters of credit totaling up to $250 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P124_S4	When we issue letters of credit under the facility, we reduce our available credit and commercial paper capacity by a corresponding amount.
58492_18_ITEM7_P124_S5	Amounts outstanding at year-end related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	The average and maximum amounts of commercial paper outstanding during 2017 were $436 million and $625 million, respectively.
58492_18_ITEM7_P125_S1	During the fourth quarter, the average and maximum amounts outstanding were $309 million and $625 million, respectively.
58492_18_ITEM7_P125_S2	At year end, we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility, but we had issued $51 million of stand-by letters of credit under other bank agreements to take advantage of better pricing.
58492_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	With cash on hand, operating cash flow, our commercial paper program, and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, we believe we have sufficient funds available to repay maturing debt (including $150 million of 4.4% notes due July 1, 2018), as well as support our ongoing operations, pay dividends, fund future growth, and repurchase stock.
58492_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	Our revolving credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations contain restrictive covenants.
58492_18_ITEM7_P127_S1	Based upon our planned use of cash, we could utilize the full $800 million of commercial paper, and we would expect to remain in compliance with all of the covenants.
58492_18_ITEM7_P127_S2	The covenants limit, among other things: a) our total amount of indebtedness to 65% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit facility), b) the amount of total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) our ability to sell, lease, transfer, or dispose of all or substantially all of total consolidated assets.
58492_18_ITEM7_P127_S3	For more information about long-term debt, please see Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 91 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	At December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $526 million primarily invested in interest-bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	Over 80% of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P128_S2	We do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing U.S. liquidity needs.
58492_18_ITEM7_P128_S3	During 2018, we expect to repatriate approximately $300 million of foreign cash.
58492_18_ITEM7_P128_S4	The timing and exact amounts of these cash repatriations are difficult to predict, and are, among other things, subject to local governmental requirements.
58492_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	As discussed previously, TCJA enacted at the end of 2017 imposed a one-time U.S. tax on the earnings that produced our foreign cash.
58492_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	This deemed repatriation tax totaled $67 million and will be paid on a graduated scale over the next eight years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	We can now bring cash to the U.S. without incurring incremental U.S. federal taxes.
58492_18_ITEM7_P129_S3	There likely will be some state-level income tax; however, we believe any such tax will not be material.
58492_18_ITEM7_P129_S4	As a result, the enactment of TCJA increases the likelihood of repatriating cash from past, current and future foreign earnings.
58492_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	If we were to bring all our current foreign cash back immediately to the U.S. in the form of dividends, we would pay previously accrued foreign withholding taxes of approximately $21 million, based upon historic foreign withholding tax rates.
58492_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	However, due to statutory requirements in various jurisdictions, approximately $36 million of this cash was inaccessible for repatriation at year end.
58492_18_ITEM7_P130_S2	In 2017, 2016, and 2015, we brought back cash of $116 million, $5 million, and $112 million, respectively, at little to no added tax cost.
58492_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	The following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2017:
58492_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	The long-term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due.
58492_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	Purchase obligations primarily include open short-term (30-120 days) purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities.
58492_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at December 31, 2017 at rates in effect at the end of the year.
58492_18_ITEM7_P134_S1	Other obligations include our net reserves for tax contingencies in the "More Than 5 Years" column because these obligations are long-term in nature and actual payment dates cannot be specifically determined.
58492_18_ITEM7_P134_S2	Other obligations also include a $62 million long-term deemed repatriation tax payable and our current estimate of $2 million for minimum contributions to defined benefit pension plans.
58492_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	To do so, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosures.
58492_18_ITEM7_P135_S2	If we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change, and some of those changes could be significant.
58492_18_ITEM7_P135_S3	Our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management, at the time they are made, to be reasonable and appropriate.
58492_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	Estimates are adjusted for actual events, as they occur.
58492_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	Critical accounting estimates are those that are: a) subject to uncertainty and change, and b) of material impact to our financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	Listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	We provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 71 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur.
58492_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of June 30 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	We begin with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model.
58492_18_ITEM7_P140_S2	Judgment is required in the two step model to estimate fair value for the reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	We estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	The cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance.
58492_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.
58492_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio.
58492_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	Ratios are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	The June 2017 review indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	However, we exited a few small businesses in each of the years presented and evaluated goodwill for impairment when they were classified as held for sale.
58492_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	We recognized goodwill impairments of less than $5 million in each of the years presented, associated with the exit of these businesses.
58492_18_ITEM7_P145_S3	Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 79.
58492_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	At December 31, 2017, we had $822 million of goodwill.
58492_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible.
58492_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).
58492_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely.
58492_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets.
58492_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.
58492_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	Impairments averaged approximately $2 million per year over the last three years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	At December 31, 2017, net property, plant and equipment was $664 million and net intangible assets other than goodwill was $169 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow-moving inventory.
58492_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	We value inventory at net realizable value (what we think we will recover).
58492_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	Generally a reserve is not required unless we have more than a one-year's supply of the product.
58492_18_ITEM7_P156_S2	If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely.
58492_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving (i.e., not selling very quickly).
58492_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow-moving.
58492_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow-moving based upon historical experience (65% on average).
58492_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	At December 31, 2017, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $35 million (approximately 6% of FIFO inventories).
58492_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	This is consistent with the $33 million of reserves at December 31, 2016 and 2015, representing 6% of FIFO inventories.
58492_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	Additions to inventory reserves in 2017 were $5 million, which were lower than 2016 and 2015 amounts of $9 million and $10 million, respectively.
58492_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	We do not expect obsolescence to change from current levels.
58492_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay.
58492_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.
58492_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $8 million annually for costs associated with workers compensation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P164_S1	Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P164_S2	At December 31, 2017, we had accrued $34 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities.
58492_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible.
58492_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	When we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.
58492_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged.
58492_18_ITEM7_P168_S1	Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.
58492_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	In cases where a customer s payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves when deemed necessary.
58492_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	Certain of our customers have from time to time experienced bankruptcy, insolvency and/or an inability to pay their debts to us as they come due.
58492_18_ITEM7_P169_S2	If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us timely or at all, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these customers.
58492_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.
58492_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	We believe we have established adequate reserves on our riskier customer accounts.
58492_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	We have experienced favorable trends in the number of accounts monitored for possible loss or written off in the last few years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P171_S2	The average annual amount of customer-related bad debt expense was less than $2 million (significantly less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years.
58492_18_ITEM7_P171_S3	At December 31, 2017, our allowances for doubtful accounts were less than $5 million (about 1% of our trade accounts and notes receivable of $528 million).
58492_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	In 2017, we completed an annuity purchase transaction for pensioners that were currently receiving a small monthly benefit, and in 2015 offered a voluntary one-time lump-sum payment option to selected participants.
58492_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	Please see Note L to our Consolidated Financial Statements on page 99.
58492_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management's judgment.
58492_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	Significant assumptions used to measure our pension liabilities and pension expense annually include: - the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future benefits - an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities) - certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality.
58492_18_ITEM7_P174_S2	Mortality assumptions represent our best estimate of the duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date.
58492_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.5 million and increases the plans benefit obligation by $8 million.
58492_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.4 million, but have no effect on the plans funded status.
58492_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption.
58492_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate.
58492_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred and reasonably estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimate of the loss.
58492_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the probability that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost.
58492_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable.
58492_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 115.
58492_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	During the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, we recorded expense of $18 million ($13 million for continuing operations and $5 million in discontinued operations).
58492_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	There were no material uninsured individual claims during the three-year period ending December 31, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time.
58492_18_ITEM7_P184_S1	These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM7_P184_S2	Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns.
58492_18_ITEM7_P184_S3	Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.
58492_18_ITEM7_P184_S4	If necessary, we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.
58492_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions.
58492_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.
58492_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which resulted in significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law affecting the Company.
58492_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	Current and expected impacts are based on our current knowledge of the legislation and certain assumptions we have made.
58492_18_ITEM7_P188_S1	Please see Note M-Income Taxes on page 103 for more information.
58492_18_ITEM7_P188_S2	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $12 million and $26 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to net operating losses and other tax carryforwards.
58492_18_ITEM7_P188_S3	The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income.
58492_18_ITEM7_P188_S4	In cases where we believe it is more likely than not that we may not realize the future potential tax benefits, we establish a valuation allowance against them.
58492_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	In addition, assumptions have been made regarding the non-repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries.
58492_18_ITEM7_P189_S1	Those assumptions may change in the future, thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation.
58492_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	Changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings.
58492_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	Audits by various taxing authorities continue as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue.
58492_18_ITEM7_P191_S1	Based upon past audit experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience.
58492_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	The likelihood of recovery of net operating losses and other tax carryforwards has been closely evaluated and is based upon such factors as the time remaining before expiration, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations.
58492_18_ITEM7_P192_S1	We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary.
58492_18_ITEM7_P192_S2	However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.
58492_18_ITEM7_P192_S3	Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense.
58492_18_ITEM7_P193_S0	Accruals for Probable Losses Although the Company denies liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, in millions, as follows:
58492_18_ITEM7_P194_S0	A large percentage of the accruals and cash payments in 2015 and 2016 were related to antitrust proceedings.
58492_18_ITEM7_P195_S0	The above litigation contingency accruals do not include accrued expenses related to workers' compensation, vehicle-related personal injury, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense.
58492_18_ITEM7_P195_S1	However, any litigation expense associated with these categories is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM7_P195_S2	For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Note H - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements under "Accrued expenses" on page 90 .
58492_18_ITEM7_P196_S0	We have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, and to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming or being substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
58492_18_ITEM7_P196_S1	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current known facts, that additional losses, if any, are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM7_P196_S2	However, based upon current known facts, as of December 31, 2017, aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable, and therefore not accrued) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $22 million, including approximately $21 million for Brazilian VAT matters and $1 million for other matters.
58492_18_ITEM7_P196_S3	If our assumptions or analyses regarding these contingencies are incorrect, or if facts change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals, and even greater than our estimate of reasonably possible losses in excess of recorded accruals.

58492_18_ITEM15_P6_S0	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Leggett Platt assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

58492_18_ITEM15_P8_S1	Based on the evaluation under this framework, we concluded that Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P9_S0	Leggett Platt s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2017 , has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 65 of this Form 10-K.
58492_18_ITEM15_P10_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Leggett Platt, Incorporated:
58492_18_ITEM15_P11_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
58492_18_ITEM15_P11_S1	We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
58492_18_ITEM15_P12_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
58492_18_ITEM15_P12_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
58492_18_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
58492_18_ITEM15_P13_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
58492_18_ITEM15_P13_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
58492_18_ITEM15_P14_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
58492_18_ITEM15_P14_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
58492_18_ITEM15_P15_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
58492_18_ITEM15_P15_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P15_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P15_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
58492_18_ITEM15_P15_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
58492_18_ITEM15_P15_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P16_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
58492_18_ITEM15_P16_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P17_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P17_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
58492_18_ITEM15_P18_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 1991.
58492_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P20_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Leggett Platt, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries ( we or our ).
58492_18_ITEM15_P24_S1	Management does not expect foreign exchange restrictions to significantly impact the ultimate realization of amounts consolidated in the accompanying financial statements for subsidiaries located outside the United States.
58492_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
58492_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the accrual and disclosure of loss contingencies.
58492_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash equivalents include cash in excess of daily requirements which is invested in various financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
58492_18_ITEM15_P28_S0	TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS: Trade receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest.
58492_18_ITEM15_P28_S1	Credit is also occasionally extended in the form of a note receivable to facilitate our customers operating cycles.
58492_18_ITEM15_P28_S2	Other notes receivable are established in special circumstances, such as in partial payment for the sale of a business or to support other business opportunities.
58492_18_ITEM15_P28_S3	Other notes receivable generally bear interest at market rates commensurate with the corresponding credit risk on the date of origination.
58492_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	The allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate of the amount of probable credit losses.
58492_18_ITEM15_P30_S0	Interest income is not recognized for nonperforming accounts that are placed on nonaccrual status.
58492_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	Allowances and nonaccrual status designations are determined by individual account reviews by management, and are based on several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial health of the companies involved, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.
58492_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	Interest income is recorded on the date of cash receipt for nonaccrual status accounts.
58492_18_ITEM15_P32_S1	Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.
58492_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	All inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
58492_18_ITEM15_P33_S1	We generally use standard costs which include materials, labor and production overhead at normal production capacity.
58492_18_ITEM15_P33_S2	The cost for approximately 50% of our inventories is determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and is primarily used to value domestic inventories with raw material content consisting of steel, wire, chemicals and foam scrap.
58492_18_ITEM15_P33_S3	For the remainder of the inventories, we principally use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which is representative of our standard costs.
58492_18_ITEM15_P33_S4	For these inventories, the FIFO cost for the periods presented approximated expected replacement cost.
58492_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	Inventories are reviewed at least quarterly for slow-moving and potentially obsolete items using actual inventory turnover, and if necessary, are written down to estimated net realizable value.
58492_18_ITEM15_P34_S1	We have had no material changes in inventory writedowns or slow-moving and obsolete inventory reserves in any of the years presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	The following table presents the activity in our LIFO reserve for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
58492_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	Significant accounting policies associated with a decision to dispose of a business are discussed below:
58492_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	A business is classified as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations or financial results, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, or is disposed of by sale or otherwise.
58492_18_ITEM15_P37_S1	Significant judgments are involved in determining whether a business meets the criteria for discontinued operations reporting and the period in which these criteria are met.
58492_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	If a business is reported as a discontinued operation, the results of operations through the date of sale, including any gain or loss recognized on the disposition, are presented on a separate line of the income statement.
58492_18_ITEM15_P38_S1	Interest on debt directly attributable to the discontinued operation is allocated to discontinued operations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P38_S2	Gains and losses related to the sale of businesses that do not meet the discontinued operation criteria are reported in continuing operations and separately disclosed if significant.
58492_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	Assets Held for Sale An asset or business is classified as held for sale when (i) management commits to a plan to sell and it is actively marketed; (ii) it is available for immediate sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year; and (iii) it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
58492_18_ITEM15_P39_S1	In isolated instances, assets held for sale may exceed one year due to events or circumstances beyond our control.
58492_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	Upon being classified as held for sale, the recoverability of the carrying value must be assessed.
58492_18_ITEM15_P40_S1	Evaluating the recoverability of the assets of a business classified as held for sale follows a defined order in which property and intangible assets subject to amortization are considered only after the recoverability of goodwill and other assets are assessed.
58492_18_ITEM15_P40_S2	After the valuation process is completed, the assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less cost to sell, and the assets are no longer depreciated or amortized.
58492_18_ITEM15_P40_S3	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell.
58492_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	The assets and related liabilities are aggregated and reported on separate lines of the balance sheet.
58492_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	If a decision to dispose of an asset or a business is made and the held-for-sale criteria are not met, it is considered held for use.
58492_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	Assets of the business are evaluated for recoverability in the following order: (i) assets other than goodwill, property and intangibles; (ii) property and intangibles subject to amortization; and (iii) goodwill.
58492_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	In evaluating the recoverability of property and intangible assets subject to amortization, the carrying value is first compared to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition.
58492_18_ITEM15_P44_S1	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted expected cash flows, then a fair value analysis is performed.
58492_18_ITEM15_P44_S2	An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
58492_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	Loss contingencies are accrued when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
58492_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	If a range of outcomes are possible, the most likely outcome is used to accrue these costs.
58492_18_ITEM15_P45_S2	If no outcome is more likely, we accrue at the minimum amount of the range.
58492_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	Any insurance recovery is recorded separately if it is determined that a recovery is probable.
58492_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	Legal fees are accrued when incurred.
58492_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.
58492_18_ITEM15_P47_S1	Assets are depreciated by the straight-line method and salvage value, if any, is assumed to be minimal.
58492_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	The table below presents the depreciation periods of the estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	Accelerated methods are used for tax purposes.
58492_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	Property is reviewed for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable as discussed above.
58492_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	Goodwill results from the acquisition of existing businesses and is not amortized; it is assessed for impairment annually and as triggering events may occur.
58492_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	We perform our annual review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_18_ITEM15_P51_S2	Our nine reporting units are the business groups one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available.
58492_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.
58492_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	conclude that the goodwill of a reporting unit is not impaired, then no further action is required (commonly referred to as the Step Zero Analysis approach).
58492_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	For those reporting units where a significant change or event occurs, and where potential impairment indicators exist (based on the Step Zero Analysis approach), recoverability of goodwill is then evaluated using a two-step process.
58492_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value.
58492_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the process is necessary and involves a comparison of the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	If the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.
58492_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	Fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: a market approach and an income approach.
58492_18_ITEM15_P57_S1	Each method is generally given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P57_S2	Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction, we believe that the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value.
58492_18_ITEM15_P57_S3	Assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections, which are used to project future revenues, earnings, and after-tax cash flows for each reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P57_S4	These assumptions are applied consistently for both methods.
58492_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	The market approach estimates fair value by first determining price-to-earnings ratios for comparable publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	The price-to-earnings ratio for comparable companies is based upon current enterprise value compared to the historical earnings for the past two years.
58492_18_ITEM15_P58_S2	The enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a control premium.
58492_18_ITEM15_P58_S3	Projected earnings are based upon market analysts projections.
58492_18_ITEM15_P58_S4	The earnings ratios are applied to the projected earnings of the comparable reporting unit to estimate fair value.
58492_18_ITEM15_P58_S5	Management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.
58492_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flow that is discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of future cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	Management believes that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long-term operating cash flow performance.
58492_18_ITEM15_P60_S0	Discounted cash flow projections are based on 10-year financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections noted above, sales growth, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, terminal value growth rates, future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P61_S0	There are inherent assumptions and judgments required in the analysis of goodwill impairment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P61_S1	It is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future.
58492_18_ITEM15_P62_S0	Substantially all other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used in evaluating the recoverability of property, plant and equipment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	The cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted is based on the fair market value of the award as of the grant date.
58492_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	Expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the award.
58492_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	We recognize sales when title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
58492_18_ITEM15_P64_S1	The terms of our sales are split approximately evenly between FOB shipping point and FOB destination.
58492_18_ITEM15_P64_S2	The timing of our recognition of FOB destination sales is determined based on shipping date and distance to the destination.
58492_18_ITEM15_P64_S3	We have no significant or unusual price protection, right of return or acceptance provisions with our customers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	Sales allowances, discounts and rebates can be reasonably estimated throughout the period and are deducted from sales in arriving at net sales.
58492_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS: Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of Cost of goods sold.
58492_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	RESTRUCTURING COSTS: Restructuring costs are items such as employee termination, contract termination, plant closure and asset relocation costs related to exit activities or workforce reductions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P67_S1	Restructuring-related items are inventory writedowns and gains or losses from sales of assets recorded as the result of exit activities.
58492_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred.
58492_18_ITEM15_P69_S0	Certain termination benefits for which employees are required to render service are recognized ratably over the respective future service periods.
58492_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes.
58492_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.
58492_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year.
58492_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	Deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and laws, as appropriate.
58492_18_ITEM15_P71_S2	A valuation allowance is provided to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized.
58492_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	A provision is also made for incremental taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be indefinitely invested.
58492_18_ITEM15_P73_S0	The calculation of our U.S., state, and foreign tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax laws.
58492_18_ITEM15_P73_S1	We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues which might arise in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.
58492_18_ITEM15_P73_S2	If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.
58492_18_ITEM15_P73_S3	Conversely, if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to tax expense would result.
58492_18_ITEM15_P74_S0	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS, EXPOSURES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We manufacture, market, and distribute products for the various end markets described in Note E .
58492_18_ITEM15_P74_S1	Our operations are principally located in the United States, although we also have operations in Europe, China, Canada, Mexico and other various countries.
58492_18_ITEM15_P75_S0	We maintain allowances for potential credit losses.
58492_18_ITEM15_P75_S1	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally require no collateral from our customers, some of which are highly leveraged.
58492_18_ITEM15_P75_S2	Management also monitors the financial condition and status of other notes receivable.
58492_18_ITEM15_P76_S0	Other notes receivable have historically primarily consisted of notes accepted as partial payment for the divestiture of a business or to support other business opportunities.
58492_18_ITEM15_P76_S1	Some of these companies are highly leveraged and the notes are not fully collateralized.
58492_18_ITEM15_P77_S0	We have no material guarantees or liabilities for product warranties which require disclosure.
58492_18_ITEM15_P78_S0	From time to time, we will enter into contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions, and interest rates related to our debt.
58492_18_ITEM15_P79_S0	To minimize the risk of counterparty default, only highly-rated financial institutions that meet certain requirements are used.
58492_18_ITEM15_P79_S1	We do not anticipate that any of the financial institution counterparties will default on their obligations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P80_S0	The carrying value of cash and short-term financial instruments approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P81_S0	Although we obtain insurance for workers compensation, automobile, product and general liability, property loss and medical claims, we have elected to retain a significant portion of expected losses through the use of deductibles.
58492_18_ITEM15_P81_S1	Accrued liabilities include estimates for unpaid reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported.
58492_18_ITEM15_P81_S2	Provisions for losses are recorded based upon reasonable estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing our prior experience and information provided by our third-party administrators and insurance carriers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P82_S0	DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage market and financial risks related to foreign currency and interest rates.
58492_18_ITEM15_P82_S1	We seek to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however some instruments that economically manage currency risk may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P82_S2	It is our policy not to speculate using derivative instruments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	Under hedge accounting, we formally document our hedge relationships, including identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for entering into the hedge transaction.
58492_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	The process includes designating derivative instruments as hedges of specific assets, liabilities, firm commitments or forecasted transactions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P83_S2	We also formally assess both at inception and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
58492_18_ITEM15_P83_S3	If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective, deferred gains or losses are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	On the date the contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as one of the following types of hedging instruments and account for it as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	The hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability or anticipated transaction is designated as a cash flow hedge.
58492_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	The effective portion of the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
58492_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	When the hedged item impacts the income statement, the gain or loss included in other comprehensive income is reported on the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations as the hedged item to match the gain or loss on the derivative to the gain or loss on the hedged item.
58492_18_ITEM15_P86_S2	Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value is immediately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	Settlements associated with the sale or production of product are presented in operating cash flows and settlements associated with debt issuance are presented in financing cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	The hedge of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a fair value hedge.
58492_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	For fair value hedges, both the effective and ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative, along with the gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings and reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on the same line as the hedged item.
58492_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	The functional currency for most foreign operations is the local currency.
58492_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for income and expense accounts using monthly average exchange rates.
58492_18_ITEM15_P90_S2	The cumulative effects of translating the functional currencies into the U.S. dollar are included in comprehensive income.
58492_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years information in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to conform to the 2017 presentation.
58492_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	These were primarily a result of changes in our management organizational structure and related internal reporting (See Note E - Segment Information ).
58492_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regularly issues updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification that are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (ASU).
58492_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	Below is a summary of the ASUs, effective for current or future periods, most relevant to our financial statements:
58492_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	ASU 2016-16 "Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory": Eliminates deferral of the tax effects of all intra-entity asset sales other than inventory, resulting in tax expense being recorded on the sale of the asset in the seller's tax jurisdiction when the sale occurs, even though the pretax effects of the transaction are eliminated in consolidation.
58492_18_ITEM15_P93_S1	Any deferred tax asset arising in the buyer's jurisdiction is also recognized at the time of sale.
58492_18_ITEM15_P93_S2	We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P93_S3	The modified retrospective approach was required, and as a result, we recorded a $1.1 increase to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P93_S4	Adoption of this new guidance did not materially impact our 2017 Consolidated Statements of Operations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	To be adopted in future years:
58492_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Supersedes most of the existing authoritative literature for revenue recognition and prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P95_S1	This standard was issued in 2015 and was subsequently amended several times in 2016.
58492_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	We will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018.
58492_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	We do not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact our future statements of operations, total assets, or cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P96_S1	We will transition to the new standard using the modified retrospective method.
58492_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	Under the modified retrospective method, there will be an adjustment to our January 1, 2018, equity for the cumulative effect of existing contracts.
58492_18_ITEM15_P97_S1	2017 and earlier years will be presented under legacy GAAP.
58492_18_ITEM15_P97_S2	2018 will be presented under the new standard for existing and new contracts.
58492_18_ITEM15_P97_S3	The footnotes will disclose existing and new contracts under both the new standard and legacy GAAP.
58492_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	We disclosed in our September 30, 2017 Form 10-Q that we identified certain contracts containing provisions that will require the recognition of revenue over time.
58492_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	These contracts were for the production of a highly customized good with no alternative use where we had a contractual right to payment (including a normal profit) for goods in a finished goods status in the event of contract termination.
58492_18_ITEM15_P98_S2	In finalizing our interpretation of Topic 606 and a deeper analysis of the termination provisions of these contracts, we have concluded that most of our contracts will not meet the criteria to recognize revenue over time.
58492_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	At the work-in-process stage, our contract provisions only provide for a reimbursement of costs.
58492_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	Based on these conclusions, we would lack the contractual right to a payment that includes a normal profit throughout the duration of the contract.
58492_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	Thus, Topic 606 would require revenue to be recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods in most of our contractual arrangements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	We have concluded that our customer obtains control of a good when it has the ability to direct the use of the good, obtain substantially all the remaining benefits of that good, or obtain the right to deploy or restrict another entity from deploying the good.
58492_18_ITEM15_P100_S1	We believe this control transfer will occur upon shipment from our facility or upon delivery to our customer s facility and will depend on the terms of the contract.
58492_18_ITEM15_P100_S2	We do not believe our control transfer conclusion will have a material impact on our income statement when compared to legacy GAAP.
58492_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	During the fourth quarter, we concluded our tooling arrangements with our customers are not part of ongoing major or central operations and therefore, do not transfer a good or service to our customers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P101_S1	In these tooling arrangements, we enter into a contract to produce or obtain tooling to be used in production of that customer s goods, and that customer agrees to reimburse us for the costs of that tooling.
58492_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	We believe that our tooling arrangements are activities to fulfill our performance obligations to our customers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	Under prior accounting standards for the recognition of revenue, we recorded an immaterial amount of revenue related to these reimbursements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	Upon adoption of Topic 606, we will account for these tooling costs and reimbursements on a net basis and recognize no revenue related to tooling reimbursements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P103_S2	This change will not materially impact our revenues, cost of sales, net earnings, or our total assets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842): Requires that a lessee recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for most lease arrangements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	This ASU will be effective January 1, 2019.
58492_18_ITEM15_P104_S2	We have assembled a cross-functional implementation team and are assessing all potential impacts of the standard.
58492_18_ITEM15_P104_S3	We believe our assets and liabilities will increase for the adoption of this ASU through the recording of these right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities.
58492_18_ITEM15_P104_S4	We continue to evaluate its impact on our statements of operations and cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	ASU 2017-12 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities : This ASU is intended to simplify and clarify the accounting and disclosure requirements for hedging activities by more closely aligning the results of cash flow and fair value hedge accounting with the risk management activities of an entity.
58492_18_ITEM15_P105_S1	The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
58492_18_ITEM15_P106_S0	We are currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	ASU 2017-04, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment": This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test.
58492_18_ITEM15_P107_S1	Under this ASU, the annual goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.
58492_18_ITEM15_P107_S2	An impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value up to the total amount of goodwill for the reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P107_S3	This ASU will be effective January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted.
58492_18_ITEM15_P107_S4	We are currently evaluating this guidance, and do not expect it to materially impact our future financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P108_S0	ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income : This ASU provides financial statement preparers with an option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income in each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is recorded.
58492_18_ITEM15_P108_S1	The ASU will be effective for us January 1, 2019.
58492_18_ITEM15_P108_S2	Early adoption is permitted and the amendments should be applied in either the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in federal corporate income tax rate in the TCJA is recognized.
58492_18_ITEM15_P108_S3	We are currently evaluating this guidance.
58492_18_ITEM15_P109_S0	ASUs 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) and 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) are currently being evaluated; however, we do not expect these updates to materially impact our future financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P110_S0	The FASB has issued accounting guidance, in addition to the issuance discussed above, effective for current and future periods.
58492_18_ITEM15_P110_S1	This guidance did not have a material impact on our current financial statements, and we do not believe it will have a material impact on our future financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P111_S0	The table below includes activity related to discontinued operations for the years presented:
58492_18_ITEM15_P112_S0	(1) During the fourth quarter of 2014, we divested the majority of our Store Fixtures reporting unit, which was previously part of the Furniture Products segment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P112_S1	We sold the final Store Fixtures business in the fourth quarter of 2015.
58492_18_ITEM15_P112_S2	Total consideration for these businesses was approximately $72.0 during this time period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P112_S3	No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of these businesses.
58492_18_ITEM15_P113_S0	(2) Activity is primarily related to two unrelated litigation settlements associated with our former Prime Foam Products unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P114_S0	This unit was sold in March 2007 and was previously part of the Residential Products segment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P114_S1	During 2016, we received proceeds from an antitrust litigation settlement of approximately $38.0 ( $25.0 after-tax) of which $31.4 ( $19.8 after-tax) is associated with this unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P114_S2	Additionally, during 2017 we settled a final antitrust litigation for a cash payment that was not material to the company and was not materially different from the amount previously accrued for the claim.
58492_18_ITEM15_P114_S3	(3) The 2016 tax expense is primarily related to the antitrust litigation settlement.
58492_18_ITEM15_P115_S0	The following businesses were divested during the periods presented, but did not meet the discontinued operations criteria.
58492_18_ITEM15_P116_S0	The amounts discussed below are not included in the operating results presented in the above table.
58492_18_ITEM15_P117_S0	In 2017, we realized a pretax loss of $3.3 related to the sale of our remaining CVP operation.
58492_18_ITEM15_P117_S1	We also completed the sale of real estate associated with this operation, realizing a pretax gain of $23.4 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P118_S0	In 2016, we realized gains of $21.2 and $11.2 related to the sale of the wire operations and a CVP operation, respectively.
58492_18_ITEM15_P118_S1	No other material gains or losses were realized on the sale of other businesses.
58492_18_ITEM15_P119_S0	Pretax impact of impairment charges is summarized in the following table.
58492_18_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Statements of Operations reflect the following: Goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments are reported in "Impairments"; discontinued operations are reported in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.
58492_18_ITEM15_P121_S0	As discussed in Note A , we test other long-lived assets for recoverability at year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
58492_18_ITEM15_P122_S0	Fair value and the resulting impairment charges noted above were based primarily upon offers from potential buyers or third party estimates of fair value less selling costs.
58492_18_ITEM15_P123_S0	As discussed in Note A , goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least once a year and as triggering events may occur.
58492_18_ITEM15_P123_S1	We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of each year.
58492_18_ITEM15_P124_S0	The 2017 annual goodwill impairment review indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P125_S0	We performed a Step Zero Analysis for our annual goodwill review for each of our reporting units and we considered i) the excess in fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying amount from the most recent quantitative analysis, ii) macroeconomic conditions, iii) industry and market trends, and iv) overall financial performance.
58492_18_ITEM15_P125_S1	We concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of all reporting units, except for two, exceeded their carrying values.
58492_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	Because sales and profits for two reporting units were less than expected, we performed a quantitative analysis for our Work Furniture and Aerospace reporting units under the two-step model.
58492_18_ITEM15_P126_S1	These reporting units were determined to have fair values in excess of their carrying amounts of at least 75% .
58492_18_ITEM15_P126_S2	Goodwill associated with these two reporting units was $157.4 at December 31, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	During the third quarter of 2017, a wire operation within the Industrial Products segment reached held-for-sale status.
58492_18_ITEM15_P127_S1	Because fair value less costs to sell had fallen below the carrying amount, we fully impaired $1.3 of goodwill and $3.3 of other long-lived assets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	Because all reporting unit fair values exceeded their respective carrying values (fair value over carrying value divided by carrying value) by a range of 115% to 600% during the 2015 testing (performed on a quantitative basis for all reporting units), we performed a qualitative assessment (Step Zero Analysis) for our annual goodwill impairment review in the second quarter of 2016.
58492_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	Among other things, we considered i) the excess in fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying amount from the most recent quantitative analysis, ii) macroeconomic conditions, iii) industry and market trends, and iv) overall financial performance.
58492_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	Based on the Step Zero Analysis we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amount, except for our CVP reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	With regard to our CVP reporting unit, in the second quarter of 2016 we sold one of our two remaining businesses.
58492_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	Additionally, real estate associated with the remaining CVP business reached held-for-sale status during the second quarter of 2016.
58492_18_ITEM15_P130_S2	As a result of these two events, the fair value of the CVP reporting unit (consisting of one remaining business) had fallen below its carrying amount, and we fully impaired the remaining $3.7 of goodwill for this reporting unit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	The 2015 goodwill impairment review indicated no goodwill impairments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	The Steel Tubing unit met the held-for-sale criteria during the first quarter of 2015.
58492_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	Because fair value less costs to sell had fallen below recorded book value, we fully impaired $4.1 of goodwill and $1.4 of other long-lived assets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	The fair values of reporting units in relation to their respective carrying values and significant assumptions used in the second quarter 2015 review are presented in the table below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	(1) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Commercial Vehicle Products unit as outlined in Note C .
58492_18_ITEM15_P135_S1	(2) We recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to a wire operation as outlined in Note C .
58492_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by intangible asset class and intangible assets acquired during the period presented included in "Other intangibles" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	Estimated amortization expense for items included in our December 31, 2017 balance sheet in each of the next five years is as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management structure.
58492_18_ITEM15_P138_S1	In conjunction with a change in executive officers, our management structure and all related internal reporting changed as of January 1, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P138_S2	As a result, the composition of our four segments also changed to reflect the new structure.
58492_18_ITEM15_P138_S3	The new structure is largely the same as prior years except the Home Furniture Group moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products (formerly Commercial Products) and the Machinery Group moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products.
58492_18_ITEM15_P138_S4	In addition, the changes in LIFO reserve are now recognized within the segments to which they relate (primarily Industrial Products).
58492_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	accounting for certain inventories and an adjustment to the LIFO basis for these inventories was made at the consolidated financial statement level.
58492_18_ITEM15_P139_S1	These changes were retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P139_S2	The methods and assumptions that we use in estimating our LIFO reserve did not change (See Note A - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ).
58492_18_ITEM15_P140_S0	We have four operating segments that supply a wide range of products:
58492_18_ITEM15_P141_S0	Residential Products: This segment supplies a variety of components and machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products.
58492_18_ITEM15_P141_S1	We also produce or distribute carpet cushion, fabric, and geo components.
58492_18_ITEM15_P142_S0	Industrial Products: These operations primarily supply steel rod and drawn steel wire to our other operations and to external customers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P142_S1	This wire is used to make bedding, mechanical springs, and many other end products.
58492_18_ITEM15_P143_S0	Furniture Products: Operations in this segment supply a wide range of components for residential and work furniture manufacturers, as well as select lines of private-label finished furniture, adjustable bed bases, fashion beds, and bed frames.
58492_18_ITEM15_P144_S0	Specialized Products: From this segment we supply lumbar support systems, seat suspension systems, motors and actuators, and control cables used by automotive manufacturers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P144_S1	We also produce and distribute tubing and tube assemblies for the aerospace industry.
58492_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	Each reportable segment has an executive vice president that reports to the chief executive officer, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM).
58492_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	The operating results and financial information reported through the segment structure are regularly reviewed and used by the CODM to evaluate segment performance, allocate overall resources and determine management incentive compensation.
58492_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	Separately, we also utilize a role-based approach (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest) as a supplemental management tool to ensure capital (which is a subset of the overall resources referred to above) is efficiently allocated within the reportable segment structure.
58492_18_ITEM15_P147_S0	The accounting principles used in the preparation of the segment information are the same as those used for the consolidated financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P148_S0	We evaluate performance based on EBIT.
58492_18_ITEM15_P149_S0	Intersegment sales are made primarily at prices that approximate market-based selling prices.
58492_18_ITEM15_P150_S0	Centrally incurred costs are allocated to the segments based on estimates of services used by the segment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P150_S1	Certain of our general and administrative costs and miscellaneous corporate income and expenses are allocated to the segments based on sales or other appropriate metrics.
58492_18_ITEM15_P150_S2	These allocated corporate costs include depreciation and other costs and income related to assets that are not allocated or otherwise included in the segment assets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	A summary of segment results for the periods presented are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	(1) Intersegment eliminations and other includes $15.3 and $12.1 of pension settlements in years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015, respectively (See Note L ).
58492_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	Average assets for our segments are shown in the table below and reflect the basis for return measures used by management to evaluate segment performance.
58492_18_ITEM15_P153_S1	These segment totals include working capital (all current assets and current liabilities) plus net property, plant and equipment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P153_S2	Segment assets for all years are reflected at their estimated average for the year.

58492_18_ITEM15_P170_S0	We can raise cash by issuing up to $800 of commercial paper through a program that is backed by a $800 revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 14 lenders.
58492_18_ITEM15_P170_S1	In November 2017, we increased the borrowing capacity under the facility from $750 to $800 and extended the term by one year to 2022.
58492_18_ITEM15_P171_S0	The credit facility allows us to issue total letters of credit up to $250 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P171_S1	When we issue letters of credit in this manner, our capacity under the facility, and consequently, our ability to issue commercial paper, is reduced by a corresponding amount.
58492_18_ITEM15_P171_S2	We had no outstanding letters of credit under the facility at year end for the periods presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P172_S0	Amounts outstanding at December 31 related to our commercial paper program were:
58492_18_ITEM15_P173_S0	The revolving credit facility and certain other long-term debt contain restrictive covenants which, among other things, limit a) the total amount of indebtedness to 65% of our total capitalization (each as defined in the revolving credit facility), b) the amount of our total secured debt to 15% of our total consolidated assets, and c) our ability to sell, lease, transfer or dispose of all or substantially all of total consolidated assets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P173_S1	We have remained well within compliance with all such covenants.
58492_18_ITEM15_P174_S0	Generally we may elect one of four types of borrowing under the revolving credit facility, which determines the rate of interest to be paid on the outstanding principal balance.
58492_18_ITEM15_P174_S1	various published rates plus a pre-defined spread.
58492_18_ITEM15_P175_S0	We are required to periodically pay accrued interest on any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility at different time intervals based upon the elected interest rate and the elected interest period.

58492_18_ITEM15_P175_S2	We may also terminate or reduce the lending commitments under this facility, in whole or in part, upon three business days notice.
58492_18_ITEM15_P176_S0	We lease certain operating facilities, most of our automotive and trucking equipment and various other assets.

58492_18_ITEM15_P180_S0	We use various forms of share-based compensation which are summarized below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P181_S0	One stock unit is equivalent to one common share for accounting and earnings per share purposes.
58492_18_ITEM15_P182_S0	Shares are issued from treasury for the majority of our stock plans activity.
58492_18_ITEM15_P182_S1	All share information is presented in millions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P183_S0	Stock options and stock units are granted pursuant to our Flexible Stock Plan (the "Plan").
58492_18_ITEM15_P183_S1	Each option counts as one share against the shares available under the Plan, but each share granted for any other awards will count as three shares against the Plan.
58492_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	At December 31, 2017, the following common shares were authorized for issuance under the Plan:
58492_18_ITEM15_P185_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation (including discontinued operations) on the results of operations for each of the periods presented:
58492_18_ITEM15_P186_S0	* In the first quarter of 2016 we adopted ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
58492_18_ITEM15_P186_S1	This ASU provides that the tax effects of stock-based awards must be treated as discrete items affecting the tax rate in the interim reporting period in which the tax deductions occur.
58492_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	The following table recaps the impact of stock-based compensation on assets and liabilities for each of the periods presented:
58492_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	We have historically granted stock options in the following areas:
58492_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	Options are now offered only in conjunction with the Deferred Compensation Program discussed below, and for a few key executive awards.
58492_18_ITEM15_P190_S0	Prior to 2013, we granted stock options annually on a discretionary basis to a broad group of employees.
58492_18_ITEM15_P190_S1	Options generally become exercisable in one-third increments at 18 months , 30 months and 42 months after the date of grant.
58492_18_ITEM15_P190_S2	Options have a maximum term of ten years and the exercise prices are equal to Leggett s closing stock price on the grant date.
58492_18_ITEM15_P191_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and are amortized by the straight-line method over the options total vesting period, except for employees who are retirement eligible.
58492_18_ITEM15_P192_S0	Expense for employees who are retirement eligible is recognized immediately.
58492_18_ITEM15_P193_S0	A person is retirement eligible if the employee is age 65 , or age 55 with 20 years of Company service.
58492_18_ITEM15_P194_S0	We offer a Deferred Compensation Program under which key managers and outside directors may elect to receive stock options, stock units or interest-bearing cash deferrals in lieu of cash compensation:
58492_18_ITEM15_P195_S0	Stock options under this program are granted in the last month of the year prior to the year the compensation is earned.
58492_18_ITEM15_P195_S1	The number of options granted equals the deferred compensation times five , divided by the stock s market price on the date of grant.
58492_18_ITEM15_P195_S2	The option has a 10 -year term.
58492_18_ITEM15_P195_S3	It vests as the associated compensation is earned and becomes exercisable beginning 15 months after the grant date.
58492_18_ITEM15_P196_S0	Stock is issued when the option is exercised.
58492_18_ITEM15_P197_S0	Deferred stock units (DSU) under this program are acquired every two weeks (when the compensation would have otherwise been paid) at a 20% discount to the market price of our common stock on each acquisition date, and they vest immediately.
58492_18_ITEM15_P197_S1	Expense is recorded as the compensation is earned.
58492_18_ITEM15_P197_S2	Stock units earn dividends at the same rate as cash dividends paid on our common stock.
58492_18_ITEM15_P197_S3	These dividends are used to acquire stock units at a 20% discount.
58492_18_ITEM15_P198_S0	converted to common stock and distributed in accordance with the participant s pre-set election.
58492_18_ITEM15_P198_S1	However, stock units may be settled in cash at our discretion.
58492_18_ITEM15_P198_S2	Participants must begin receiving distributions no later than ten years after the effective date of the deferral and installment distributions cannot exceed ten years.
58492_18_ITEM15_P199_S0	Interest-bearing cash deferrals under this program are reported in Other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note H .
58492_18_ITEM15_P200_S0	Stock option information for the plans discussed above for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	* A small number of options related to this plan (less than .1 ) were outstanding at December 31, 2017.

58492_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	Additional information related to stock option activity for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	The following table summarizes fair values calculated (and assumptions utilized) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
58492_18_ITEM15_P205_S0	The risk-free rate is determined based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for maturities equivalent to the expected life of the option.
58492_18_ITEM15_P206_S0	The expected life of the option (estimated average period of time the option will be outstanding) is estimated based on the historical exercise behavior of employees, with executives displaying somewhat longer holding periods than other employees.
58492_18_ITEM15_P206_S1	Expected volatility is based on historical volatility through the grant date, measured daily for a time period equal to the option s expected life.
58492_18_ITEM15_P206_S2	The expected dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend yield at the time of grant.
58492_18_ITEM15_P207_S0	We have two stock-based retirement plans: the tax-qualified Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) for non-highly compensated employees, and the non-qualified Executive Stock Unit Program (ESUP) for highly compensated employees.
58492_18_ITEM15_P207_S1	We make matching contributions to both plans.
58492_18_ITEM15_P207_S2	In addition to the automatic 50% match, we will make another matching contribution of up to 50% of the employee s contributions for the year if certain profitability levels, as defined in the SBP and the ESUP, are obtained.
58492_18_ITEM15_P208_S0	Participants in the SBP may contribute up to 6% of their compensation above a certain threshold to purchase Leggett stock or other investment alternatives at market prices.
58492_18_ITEM15_P208_S1	Employees are allowed to fully diversify their employee deferral accounts immediately and their employer matching accounts after three years of service.
58492_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	Dividends earned on Company stock held in the SBP are reinvested or paid in cash at the participant s election.
58492_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	Participants in the ESUP may contribute up to 10% (depending upon salary level) of their compensation above the same threshold applicable to the SBP.
58492_18_ITEM15_P210_S1	Participant contributions are credited to a diversified investment account established for the participant, and we make premium contributions to the diversified investment accounts equal to 17.65% of the participant s contribution.
58492_18_ITEM15_P210_S2	A participant s diversified investment account balance is adjusted to mirror the investment experience, whether positive or negative, of the diversified investments selected by the participant.
58492_18_ITEM15_P210_S3	Participants may change investment elections in the diversified investment accounts, but cannot purchase Company common stock or stock units.
58492_18_ITEM15_P210_S4	The diversified investment accounts consist of various mutual funds and retirement target funds and are unfunded, unsecured obligations of the Company that will be settled in cash.
58492_18_ITEM15_P210_S5	Both the assets and liabilities associated with this program are presented in the table above and are adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	Company matching contributions to the ESUP, including dividend equivalents, are used to acquire stock units at 85% of the common stock market price on the acquisition date.
58492_18_ITEM15_P211_S1	Stock units are converted to common stock at a 1-to-1 ratio upon distribution from the program and may be settled in cash at our discretion.
58492_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	Company matches in the SBP and ESUP fully vest upon three and five years, respectively, of cumulative service, subject to certain participation requirements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P212_S1	Distributions under both plans are triggered by an employee s retirement, death, disability or separation from Leggett.
58492_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	Information for employee contributions the year ended December 31 for these plans was as follows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P213_S1	See the stock-based compensation table above for information regarding employer contributions.

58492_18_ITEM15_P217_S1	Participants will earn from 0% to 175% of the base award depending upon how our TSR ranks within the peer group at the end of the 3 -year performance period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P218_S0	Grant date fair values are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation of stock and volatility data for Leggett and each of the comparator companies.
58492_18_ITEM15_P218_S1	Grant date fair values are amortized using the straight-line method over the three -year vesting period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P219_S0	Below is a summary of the number of shares and related grant date fair value of PSU s for the periods presented:
58492_18_ITEM15_P220_S0	We intend to pay out 65% of awards in shares of our common stock and 35% in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_18_ITEM15_P220_S1	We elected to pay 100% of the 2015 award (paid in first quarter 2018) in cash.
58492_18_ITEM15_P220_S2	The cash portion is recorded as a liability and is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P221_S0	The PGI awards are issued to certain key management employees as growth performance stock units (GPSUs).
58492_18_ITEM15_P221_S1	The GPSUs vest ( 0% to 250% ) at the end of a two -year performance period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P221_S2	Vesting is based on the Company's or applicable profit center's revenue growth (adjusted by a GDP factor when applicable) and EBITDA margin over a two -year performance period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P221_S3	The 2015 through 2017 base target PGI awards were less than .1 shares each year.
58492_18_ITEM15_P221_S4	If earned, we intend to pay half in shares of our common stock and half in cash, although we reserve the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_18_ITEM15_P221_S5	Both components are recorded as liabilities and adjusted to fair value at each reporting period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P221_S6	We elected to pay 100% of the 2016 award (to be paid in March 2018) in cash.
58492_18_ITEM15_P222_S0	RSU awards are generally granted as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P223_S0	The value of these awards is determined by the stock price on the day of the award, and expense is recognized over the vesting period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P224_S0	As of December 31, 2017, the unrecognized cost of non-vested stock units that is not adjusted to fair value was $8.7 with a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 1 year.

58492_18_ITEM15_P228_S0	The new awards will vest at the end of a 3-year performance period based upon the following:
58492_18_ITEM15_P229_S0	Relative TSR - 50% of each PSU award will vest based upon on the Company s TSR compared to a peer group with conditions similar to the previous years grants discussed above.
58492_18_ITEM15_P230_S0	EBIT CAGR - 50% of each PSU award will vest based upon the Company s or applicable Segments compound annual growth rate of EBIT in the third fiscal year of the performance period compared to the applicable EBIT in the fiscal year immediately preceding the performance period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P231_S0	50% of the vested PSU award will be paid out in cash, and the Company intends to pay out the remaining 50% in shares of the Company s common stock, although the Company reserves the right to pay up to 100% in cash.
58492_18_ITEM15_P231_S1	The maximum payout is 200% of the base awards.
58492_18_ITEM15_P231_S2	In connection with the decision to move a significant portion of the long-term incentive opportunity from a 2 -year to a 3 -year performance period by eliminating PGI awards, we will also grant participants a one-time transition PSU award in 2018 based upon EBIT CAGR over a two -year performance period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P232_S0	The Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect a net liability for the funded status of our domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans.
58492_18_ITEM15_P232_S1	Our U.S. plans (comprised primarily of three significant plans) represent approximately 87% of our pension benefit obligation in each of the periods presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P232_S2	Participants in one of the significant domestic plans have stopped earning benefits; this plan is referred to as "frozen" in the following narrative.
58492_18_ITEM15_P233_S0	A summary of our pension obligations and funded status as of December 31 is as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P234_S0	1 The benefit obligation at December 31, 2017, decreased as compared to December 31, 2016, primarily due to the settlement of $59.8 of pension obligations for our U.S. plans through our annuity purchase transaction as discussed in more detail below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P235_S0	Our accumulated benefit obligation was not materially different from our projected benefit obligation for the periods presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P236_S0	Included in the above plans is a subsidiary s unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan.
58492_18_ITEM15_P236_S1	This is a non-qualified plan, and these benefits are secured by insurance policies that are not included in the plan s assets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P236_S2	Cash surrender values associated with these policies were approximately $2.0 at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
58492_18_ITEM15_P237_S0	Amounts and activity included in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with pensions are reflected below:
58492_18_ITEM15_P238_S0	1 Includes a $15.3 settlement loss, discussed in more detail below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P239_S0	Of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2017, the portions expected to be recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in 2018 are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P240_S0	Components of net pension (expense) income for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P241_S0	Assumptions used for U.S. and international plans were not significantly different.
58492_18_ITEM15_P242_S0	We use the average of the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate and Merrill Lynch AA-AAA 10 -year Bond Index rate to determine the discount rate used for our significant pension plans (rounded to the nearest 25 basis points).
58492_18_ITEM15_P243_S0	The Citigroup Pension Discount Curve rate is a calculated rate using yearly spot rates matched against expected future benefit payments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P243_S1	The Merrill Lynch Index rate is based on the weighted average yield of a portfolio of high grade Corporate Bonds with an average duration approximating the plans projected benefit payments, adjusted for any callable bonds included in the portfolio.
58492_18_ITEM15_P244_S0	The discount rates used for our other, primarily foreign, plans are based on rates appropriate for the respective country and the plan obligations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P245_S0	The overall, expected long-term rate of return is based on each plan s historical experience and our expectations of future returns based upon each plan s investment holdings, as discussed below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P246_S0	The fair value of our major categories of pension plan assets is disclosed below using a three level valuation hierarchy that separates fair value valuation techniques into the following categories:
58492_18_ITEM15_P247_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P248_S0	Level 2: Other significant inputs observable either directly or indirectly (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, yield curves, credit risk, etc.).
58492_18_ITEM15_P249_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_18_ITEM15_P250_S0	Presented below are our major categories of investments for the periods presented:
58492_18_ITEM15_P251_S0	1 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
58492_18_ITEM15_P252_S0	Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of equity, debt and government securities, as well as a stable value fund.
58492_18_ITEM15_P252_S1	The aggregate allocation of these investments is as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P253_S0	Our investment policy and strategies are established with a long-term view in mind.
58492_18_ITEM15_P253_S1	We strive for a sufficiently diversified asset mix to minimize the risk of a material loss to the portfolio value due to the devaluation of any single investment.
58492_18_ITEM15_P253_S2	In determining the appropriate asset mix, our financial strength and ability to fund potential shortfalls that might result from poor investment performance are considered.
58492_18_ITEM15_P253_S3	Approximately 50% of our significant plans (the "frozen plans") are employing a Liability Driven Investment strategy and have a target allocation of 60% fixed income and 40% equities.
58492_18_ITEM15_P253_S4	The remaining significant plans (the "active" plans) have a target allocation of 75% equities and 25% fixed income, as historical equity returns have tended to exceed bond returns over the long term.
58492_18_ITEM15_P254_S0	Assets of our domestic plans represent the majority of plan assets and are allocated to seven different investments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P255_S0	Six are mutual funds, all of which are passively managed low-cost index funds, and include:
58492_18_ITEM15_P256_S0	U.S. Total Stock Market Index: Large-, mid-, and small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_18_ITEM15_P257_S0	U.S. Large-Cap Index: Large-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_18_ITEM15_P258_S0	U.S. Small-Cap Index: Small-cap equity diversified across growth and value styles.
58492_18_ITEM15_P259_S0	World ex US Index: International equity; broad exposure across developed and emerging non-US equity markets around the world.
58492_18_ITEM15_P260_S0	Long-term Bond Index: Diversified exposure to the long-term, investment-grade U.S. bond market.
58492_18_ITEM15_P261_S0	Extended Duration Treasury Index: Diversified exposure to U.S. treasuries with maturities of 20 - 30 years.
58492_18_ITEM15_P262_S0	The Stable value fund consists of a fixed income portfolio offering consistent return and protection against interest rate volatility.
58492_18_ITEM15_P263_S0	In December 2017, to reduce the size of our pension benefit obligation, reduce volatility of contribution requirements in future years, and also reduce pension-related operational expenses over the long-term, we completed an annuity purchase transaction for pensioners that were currently receiving a small monthly benefit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P263_S1	As part of this annuity purchase, we settled $59.8 of pension obligations for U.S. retirees.
58492_18_ITEM15_P263_S2	This was paid from plan assets and did not require a cash contribution from the Company.
58492_18_ITEM15_P263_S3	As a result of these settlements, we recorded settlement losses of $15.3 ( $9.5 net of tax) reflecting the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses in the plan proportionate to the obligation that was settled.
58492_18_ITEM15_P263_S4	These settlement charges were recorded in "Cost of goods sold" and "Selling and administrative expenses" with a corresponding balance sheet reduction in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" for the year ended December 31, 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P264_S0	In October 2015, we offered a voluntary one-time lump-sum payment option to certain eligible terminated vested participants in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans that, when accepted, settled our obligation to them.
58492_18_ITEM15_P264_S1	The program provided participants with a one-time choice to receive a lump-sum settlement of their remaining pension benefit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P264_S2	As part of this voluntary lump-sum program, we settled $35.7 of pension obligations for U.S. retirees in 2015.
58492_18_ITEM15_P264_S3	This was paid from plan assets and did not require a cash contribution from the company.
58492_18_ITEM15_P264_S4	As a result of these settlements, we recorded settlement losses of $12.1 ( $7.5 net of tax) reflecting the accelerated recognition of unamortized losses in the plan proportionate to the obligation that was settled.
58492_18_ITEM15_P264_S5	These settlement charges were recorded in "Cost of goods sold" and "Selling and administrative expenses" with a corresponding balance sheet reduction in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" for the year ended December 31, 2015.
58492_18_ITEM15_P265_S0	We expect to contribute approximately $21.0 to our defined benefit pension plans in 2018, some of which are discretionary contributions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P266_S0	Estimated benefit payments expected over the next ten years are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P267_S0	The December 2017 annuity purchase transaction (discussed above) reduced the amount of estimated benefit payments expected over the next ten years as of December 31, 2017 as compared to the total reported at December 31, 2016.
58492_18_ITEM15_P268_S0	Total expense for defined contribution plans was as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P269_S0	We have limited participation in two union-sponsored, defined benefit, multi-employer pension plans.
58492_18_ITEM15_P269_S1	These plans are not administered by us, and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts.
58492_18_ITEM15_P269_S2	Aggregate contributions to these plans were less than $.8 for each of the years presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P270_S0	In addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if a plan has unfunded vested benefits.
58492_18_ITEM15_P270_S1	Factors that could impact the funded status of these plans include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P270_S2	Withdrawal liability triggers could include a plan's termination, a withdrawal of substantially all employers, or our voluntary withdrawal from the plan (such as decision to close a facility or the dissolution of a collective bargaining unit).
58492_18_ITEM15_P270_S3	We have a very small share of the liability among the participants of these plans.
58492_18_ITEM15_P270_S4	Based upon the information available from plan administrators, both of the multi-employer plans in which we participate are underfunded and estimate our aggregate share of potential withdrawal liability for both plans to be $19.3 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P270_S5	We have not recorded any material withdrawal liabilities for the years presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P271_S0	On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), enacting significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, the transition of U.S. taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system, various anti-avoidance tax provisions including a potential "global intangible low-taxed income" (GILTI) inclusion, and the imposition of a one-time tax associated with the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings not previously taxed by the U.S.
58492_18_ITEM15_P271_S1	Although these provisions are generally applicable for years after December 31, 2017, several impacted our 2017 earnings, including the one -time deemed repatriation tax, additional foreign withholding taxes for expected future cash repatriations, and the revaluation of our U.S. deferred taxes at the new, lower, federal tax rate.
58492_18_ITEM15_P271_S2	Accordingly, we recorded a provisional $50.4 net tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to these items.
58492_18_ITEM15_P272_S0	The amount recorded is our best estimate, based on our current understanding of TCJA and the guidance currently available, but should be considered provisional in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which addresses the application of U.S. GAAP where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects related to TCJA.
58492_18_ITEM15_P272_S1	We have elected to apply the provisions of SAB 118 related to our continued analysis of the impacts from TCJA including, but not limited to, the deemed repatriation tax, the revaluation of our U.S. deferred taxes, the taxes provided for expected foreign cash repatriations, and the ongoing evaluation of our permanently reinvested earnings (discussed below).
58492_18_ITEM15_P272_S2	The ultimate impact may differ from the provisional amounts we have recorded, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of TCJA.
58492_18_ITEM15_P272_S3	Our accounting will be finalized no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.
58492_18_ITEM15_P273_S0	Additionally, because of the complexity of the new GILTI rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision and the application of ASC 740.
58492_18_ITEM15_P273_S1	We have not yet made any adjustments related to potential GILTI tax in our financial statements, nor have we made any policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes on GILTI.
58492_18_ITEM15_P273_S2	We will do so no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.
58492_18_ITEM15_P274_S0	The 2017 impact from TCJA is presented below as an increase or (decrease) in the noted line items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets:
58492_18_ITEM15_P275_S0	The components of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P276_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations is comprised of the following components:
58492_18_ITEM15_P277_S0	Income tax expense from continuing operations, as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, differs from the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P278_S0	For all periods presented, the tax rate benefited from income earned in various foreign jurisdictions at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily related to China, Croatia, and Luxembourg.
58492_18_ITEM15_P278_S1	Other significant items impacting each year's tax rate are:
58492_18_ITEM15_P279_S0	In 2017, we recognized a net tax expense totaling $50.4 related to the impact of TCJA, as discussed above.
58492_18_ITEM15_P279_S1	We also recognized tax benefits totaling $28.9 , including those associated with tax attributes from a divested business and the impact of stock-based compensation.
58492_18_ITEM15_P280_S0	We recognized net tax benefits in 2016 totaling $21.4 , including a tax benefit related to stock-based compensation from the first quarter adoption of ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting".
58492_18_ITEM15_P281_S0	In 2015, we recognized net tax benefits totaling $9.4 , including a reduction in deferred taxes on undistributed foreign earnings associated with a planned reinvestment in China, and a deferred tax benefit related to our Australian operations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P282_S0	Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2016, all net excess tax benefits related to stock plan activity were recorded to additional contributed capital, which totaled $15.4 in 2015.
58492_18_ITEM15_P283_S0	We file tax returns in each jurisdiction where we are required to do so.
58492_18_ITEM15_P283_S1	In these jurisdictions, a statute of limitations period exists.
58492_18_ITEM15_P283_S2	After a statute period expires, the tax authorities can no longer assess additional income tax for the expired period.
58492_18_ITEM15_P283_S3	In addition, once the statute expires we are no longer eligible to file claims for refund for any tax that we may have overpaid.
58492_18_ITEM15_P284_S0	The total amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017, is $13.6 , of which $8.8 would impact our effective tax rate, if recognized.
58492_18_ITEM15_P284_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the periods presented is as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P285_S0	We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is consistent with prior reporting periods.
58492_18_ITEM15_P286_S0	As of December 31, 2017, four tax years were subject to audit by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS), covering the years 2014 through 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P286_S1	In 2015 and 2017, the IRS examined our 2013 and 2015 tax returns, respectively, for a U.S. non-consolidated filing entity, L P Financial Services Co., and both audits were concluded with no adjustments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P286_S2	There are no current IRS examinations in process, nor are we aware of any forthcoming.
58492_18_ITEM15_P287_S0	Additionally, at December 31, 2017, eight tax years were either subject to or undergoing audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, covering the periods 2010 through 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P287_S1	The examinations in process are at various stages of completion, but to date we are not aware of any likely material adjustments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P287_S2	In 2016, we settled an appeal with the Canada Revenue Agency relative to our 2007 and 2008 tax years related to transfer pricing issues.
58492_18_ITEM15_P287_S3	The net impact of this settlement on our financial statements was not material.
58492_18_ITEM15_P288_S0	Various state and other foreign jurisdiction tax years also remain open to examination, though we believe any assessments would not be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P289_S0	It is reasonably possible that the resolution of certain tax audits could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months, as certain tax positions may either be sustained on audit or we may agree to certain adjustments, or resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P289_S1	It is not expected that any change would have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P290_S0	Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities.
58492_18_ITEM15_P290_S1	The major temporary differences and their associated deferred tax assets or liabilities are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P291_S0	Many of the decreases in our deferred tax categories from 2016 to 2017 relate to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the U.S. tax rate reduction included in TCJA, discussed above.
58492_18_ITEM15_P291_S1	These changes decreased our overall net deferred tax liability by $26.1 in 2017, as discussed above.
58492_18_ITEM15_P291_S2	Other changes increased our net deferred tax liability by $57.3 from 2016 to 2017, and include:
58492_18_ITEM15_P292_S0	A $14.5 decrease in the deferred tax asset associated with "Pension cost and other post-retirement benefits", primarily related to the pension settlement charge ( Note L ), and the acceleration of tax deductions and other planning associated with TCJA.
58492_18_ITEM15_P293_S0	The valuation allowance primarily relates to net operating loss, tax credit, and capital loss carryforwards for which utilization is uncertain.
58492_18_ITEM15_P293_S1	Cumulative tax losses in certain state and foreign jurisdictions during recent years, limited carryforward periods in certain jurisdictions, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and reasonable tax planning strategies were among the factors considered in determining the valuation allowance.
58492_18_ITEM15_P293_S2	Individually, none of these tax carryforwards presents a material exposure.
58492_18_ITEM15_P294_S0	Most of our tax carryforwards have expiration dates that vary generally over the next 20 years, with no amount greater than $10 expiring in any one year.
58492_18_ITEM15_P295_S0	Deferred income and withholding taxes have been provided on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent it is anticipated that the earnings will be remitted in the future as dividends.
58492_18_ITEM15_P295_S1	Due to the recently enacted TCJA, we no longer asserted permanent reinvestment on $835.0 of earnings, and accrued provisional deferred taxes of $8.3 in 2017 related to certain earnings under our Canadian ownership structure, and an additional $0.7 in China.
58492_18_ITEM15_P295_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have accrued a total of $12.5 and $9.2 , respectively, of deferred taxes related to incremental withholding taxes in China.
58492_18_ITEM15_P296_S0	Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on certain foreign earnings which are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.
58492_18_ITEM15_P296_S1	The cumulative undistributed earnings which are indefinitely reinvested as of December 31, 2017, are $410.3 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P296_S2	If such earnings were repatriated to the U.S. through dividends, the resulting provisional incremental tax expense would be approximately $26.7 , based on present income tax laws and after consideration of the tax we have already accrued for the mandatory deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings (as referenced above).
58492_18_ITEM15_P297_S0	Deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P298_S0	The components of other (income) expense from continuing operations were as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P299_S0	The following table sets forth the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):
58492_18_ITEM15_P300_S0	We utilize fair value measures for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
58492_18_ITEM15_P301_S0	The areas in which we utilize fair value measures of financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P302_S0	Fair value measurements are established using a three level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into the following categories:
58492_18_ITEM15_P303_S0	Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P304_S0	Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly.
58492_18_ITEM15_P304_S1	Short-term investments in this category are valued using discounted cash flow techniques with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
58492_18_ITEM15_P304_S2	Derivative assets and liabilities in this category are valued using models that consider various assumptions and information from market-corroborated sources.
58492_18_ITEM15_P304_S3	The models used are primarily industry-standard models that consider items such as quoted prices, market interest rate curves applicable to the instruments being valued as of the end of each period, discounted cash flows, volatility factors, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
58492_18_ITEM15_P304_S4	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
58492_18_ITEM15_P305_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
58492_18_ITEM15_P306_S0	* Includes both current and long-term amounts combined.
58492_18_ITEM15_P307_S0	The fair value for fixed rate debt (Level 2) was not materially different from its carrying value of $1,250.0 and $750.0 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
58492_18_ITEM15_P308_S0	The primary areas in which we utilize fair value measures of non-financial assets and liabilities are allocating purchase price to the assets and liabilities of acquired companies as discussed in Note Q and evaluating long-term assets (including goodwill) for potential impairment as discussed in Note C .
58492_18_ITEM15_P308_S1	Determining fair values for these items requires significant judgment and includes a variety of methods and models that utilize significant Level 3 inputs.
58492_18_ITEM15_P309_S0	Long-lived assets, acquisitions and the second step of a goodwill impairment test utilize the following methodologies in determining fair value: (i) Buildings and machinery are valued at an estimated replacement cost for an asset of comparable age and condition.
58492_18_ITEM15_P309_S1	Market pricing of comparable assets are used to estimate replacement cost where available.
58492_18_ITEM15_P310_S0	The most common identified intangible assets are customer relationships and tradenames.
58492_18_ITEM15_P310_S1	Customer relationships are valued using an excess earnings method, using various inputs such as the estimated customer attrition rate, future earnings forecast, the amount of contributory asset charges, and a discount rate.
58492_18_ITEM15_P310_S2	Tradenames are valued using a relief from royalty method, which is based upon comparable market royalty rates for tradenames of similar value.
58492_18_ITEM15_P311_S0	(iii) Inventory is valued at current replacement cost for raw materials, with a step-up for work in process and finished goods items that reflects the amount of ultimate profit earned as of the valuation date.
58492_18_ITEM15_P311_S1	(iv) Other working capital items are generally recorded at face value, unless there are known conditions that would impact the ultimate settlement amount of the particular item.
58492_18_ITEM15_P312_S0	The following table contains the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition for all acquisitions during the periods presented, and any additional consideration paid for prior years acquisitions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P312_S1	A portion of the goodwill included in the table below is expected to provide an income tax benefit.
58492_18_ITEM15_P313_S0	The following table summarizes acquisitions for the periods presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P314_S0	We are finalizing all of the information required to complete the purchase price allocations related to the most recent acquisitions and do not anticipate any material modifications.
58492_18_ITEM15_P315_S0	The results of operations of the above acquired companies have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of acquisition.
58492_18_ITEM15_P315_S1	The unaudited pro forma consolidated net sales, net earnings and earnings per share as though the 2017 and 2016 acquisitions had occurred on January 1 of each year presented are not materially different from the amounts reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
58492_18_ITEM15_P316_S0	Certain of our acquisition agreements provide for additional consideration to be paid in cash at a later date and are recorded as a liability at the acquisition date.
58492_18_ITEM15_P316_S1	At December 31, 2017 and Decembers 31, 2016 our liability for these future payments was $16.5 ( $8.9 current and $7.6 long-term) and $14.5 ( $2.4 current and $12.1 long-term), respectively.
58492_18_ITEM15_P316_S2	Components of the liability are based on estimates and future events and the amounts may fluctuate significantly until the payment date.
58492_18_ITEM15_P317_S0	A brief description of our acquisition activity by year is included below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P317_S1	In 2017, we acquired three businesses: A distributor and installer of geosynthetic products, expanding the geographic scope and capabilities of our Geo Components business.
58492_18_ITEM15_P317_S2	A manufacturer of surface-critical bent tube components in support of the private-label finished seating strategy in our Work Furniture business.
58492_18_ITEM15_P317_S3	A carpet underlay manufacturer, providing additional production capacity in our Carpet Cushion business.
58492_18_ITEM15_P317_S4	These businesses broaden our geographic scope, capabilities, and product offerings, and added $11.5 ( $7.6 to Residential Products and $3.9 to Furniture Products) of goodwill.
58492_18_ITEM15_P317_S5	We also acquired the remaining 20% ownership in an Asian joint venture in our Work Furniture business for $2.6 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S0	We acquired three small businesses for a total purchase price of $29.2 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S1	The first, a U.S. manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies, expands our tube forming and fabrication capabilities and adds precision machining to our aerospace platform.
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S2	The second is a distributor of geosynthetic products, and the third, a South African producer of mattress innersprings.
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S3	In addition to these acquisitions, we purchased the remaining interest in an Automotive joint venture in China for $35.2 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S4	We acquired a 70% interest in a European private-label manufacturer of high-end upholstered furniture.
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S5	This business is complementary to our North American private-label operation and allows us to support our Work Furniture customers as they expand globally.
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S6	The initial cash outlay for the 70% interest was $12.3 and per the terms of the agreement, we will acquire the remaining 30% interest in two equal parts, in the second quarters of 2018 and 2020, respectively.
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S7	We have recorded a liability of approximately $14.0 for these future payments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S8	Future payments are estimated based upon a calculation that incorporates EBITDA and the recorded liability may fluctuate significantly until the payment dates.
58492_18_ITEM15_P318_S9	Any changes in this liability will be reflected in interest income or expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P319_S0	Derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge forecasted transactions and anticipated cash flows are as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P320_S0	Currency Cash Flow Hedges - The foreign currency hedges manage risk associated with exchange rate volatility of various currencies.
58492_18_ITEM15_P321_S0	We have also occasionally used interest rate cash flow hedges to manage interest rate risks.
58492_18_ITEM15_P322_S0	The effective changes in fair value of unexpired contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted.
58492_18_ITEM15_P323_S0	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_18_ITEM15_P324_S0	These derivatives typically manage foreign currency risk associated with subsidiaries assets and liabilities, and gains or losses are recognized currently in earnings.
58492_18_ITEM15_P324_S1	Cash flows from settled contracts are presented in the category consistent with the nature of the item being hedged.
58492_18_ITEM15_P325_S0	We have deemed ineffectiveness to be immaterial, and as a result, have not recorded any amounts for ineffectiveness.
58492_18_ITEM15_P325_S1	If a hedge was not highly effective, the portion of the change in fair value considered to be ineffective would be recognized immediately in the consolidated statements of operations.
58492_18_ITEM15_P326_S0	We have recorded the following assets and liabilities representing the fair value for our most significant derivative financial instruments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P326_S1	The fair values of the derivatives reflect the change in the market value of the derivative from the date of the trade execution and do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged item.
58492_18_ITEM15_P327_S0	The following table sets forth the pretax (gains) losses for our hedging activities for the years presented.
58492_18_ITEM15_P328_S0	This schedule includes reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income as well as derivative settlements recorded directly to income or expense.
58492_18_ITEM15_P329_S0	We are a party to various proceedings and matters involving employment, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, taxation, vehicle-related personal injury and other laws.
58492_18_ITEM15_P329_S1	When it is probable, in management's judgment, that we may incur monetary damages or other costs resulting from these proceedings or other claims, and we can reasonably estimate the amounts, we record appropriate accruals in the financial statements and make charges against earnings.
58492_18_ITEM15_P329_S2	For all periods presented, we have recorded no material charges against earnings other than as indicated below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P329_S3	Also, when it is reasonably possible that we may incur additional loss in excess of recorded accruals and we can reasonably estimate the additional losses or range of losses, we disclose such additional reasonably possible losses in these notes.
58492_18_ITEM15_P329_S4	For specific information regarding accruals, cash payments to settle litigation contingencies, and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals please see Accruals and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals below.
58492_18_ITEM15_P330_S0	In July 2016, a Company driver was involved in a traffic accident that resulted in two deaths and injury to other vehicle occupants.
58492_18_ITEM15_P330_S1	In the third quarter of 2016, the Company accrued a liability that it believed to be probable in an immaterial, estimated amount based upon known facts, opinion of counsel, as well as comparative settlements of the Company and other companies in similar proceedings.
58492_18_ITEM15_P330_S2	The accrual did not take into account applicable insurance coverage.
58492_18_ITEM15_P331_S0	The Company received information regarding the events surrounding the accident and preliminary expert reports from one family's attorney at the end of November 2017.
58492_18_ITEM15_P331_S1	No legal proceedings have been filed, no discovery has been taken, and investigation of the facts of the accident remains in its early stages.
58492_18_ITEM15_P331_S2	The Company and its insurance carriers attended a pre-litigation mediation conference regarding this matter on January 8, 2018, with a subsequent meeting on February 14, 2018, in Chicago, Illinois.
58492_18_ITEM15_P331_S3	At the mediation conference, the attorneys representing these claimants alleged the Company's driver was at fault and made a demand for monetary damages.
58492_18_ITEM15_P331_S4	Until the initial mediation session, no demand had been made against the Company.
58492_18_ITEM15_P332_S0	Based on facts received from the investigation and mediation processes, the Company, through cooperation and consent of its insurance carriers, reached a settlement with these claimants on February 14, 2018.
58492_18_ITEM15_P332_S1	The Company will pay the $5.0 self-insured retention amount and the remainder of the $48.0 settlement is the responsibility of the insurance carriers.
58492_18_ITEM15_P332_S2	The settlement is subject to contingencies, including approval by the Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court, Probate Division.
58492_18_ITEM15_P332_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $43.0 receivable from the insurance carriers and a $43.0 liability related to this matter, that is included in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
58492_18_ITEM15_P332_S4	The amount of self-insured retention to be paid by the Company had previously been accrued in the third quarter of 2016, and, therefore, the settlement had no impact on the Company's 2017 earnings.
58492_18_ITEM15_P332_S5	No other material claims have been asserted against the Company related to this accident.
58492_18_ITEM15_P332_S6	Management does not believe the settlement or the outcome of the claim will have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

58492_18_ITEM15_P333_S1	We deny all allegations in the below Brazilian actions.
58492_18_ITEM15_P333_S2	We believe that we have valid bases to contest such actions and will vigorously defend ourselves.
58492_18_ITEM15_P333_S3	However, these contingencies are subject to uncertainties, and based on current facts, we believe that it is reasonably possible (but not probable) that we may incur losses of approximately $21.0 including interest and attorney fees with respect to these assessments.
58492_18_ITEM15_P333_S4	Therefore, because it is not probable we will incur a loss, no accrual has been recorded for Brazilian VAT matters.
58492_18_ITEM15_P333_S5	For specific information regarding accruals, and reasonably possible losses in excess of accruals please see "Accruals and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals" below.

58492_18_ITEM15_P337_S1	L P Brazil argued the payments were not required to be made because of the application of tax credits that were generated by L P Brazil's use of a correct tariff code for the classification of value-added tax on the sale of mattress innersprings (i.e., the same underlying issue at stake in the other Brazilian matters).

58492_18_ITEM15_P343_S0	Accruals and Reasonably Possible Losses in Excess of Accruals Accruals for Probable Losses Although the Company denies liability in all currently threatened or pending litigation proceedings in which it is or may be a party and believes that it has valid bases to contest all claims threatened or made against it, we have recorded a litigation contingency accrual for our reasonable estimate of probable loss for pending and threatened litigation proceedings, in aggregate, in millions, as follows:
58492_18_ITEM15_P344_S0	A large percentage of the accruals and cash payments in 2015 and 2016 were related to antitrust proceedings.
58492_18_ITEM15_P345_S0	The above litigation contingency accruals do not include accrued expenses related to workers compensation, vehicle-related personal injury, product and general liability claims, taxation issues and environmental matters, some of which may contain a portion of litigation expense.
58492_18_ITEM15_P345_S1	However, any litigation expense associated with these categories is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P345_S2	For more information regarding accrued expenses, see Note H - Supplemental Balance Sheet Information under "Accrued expenses" on page 90 .
58492_18_ITEM15_P346_S0	We have relied on several facts and circumstances to conclude that some loss is probable with respect to certain proceedings and matters, and to arrive at a reasonable estimate of loss or range of loss and record the accruals, including: the maturation of the pending proceedings and matters; our experience in settlement negotiations and mediation; comparative settlements of other companies in similar proceedings; discovery becoming or being substantially complete in certain proceedings; certain quantitative metrics used to value probable loss contingencies; and our willingness to settle certain proceedings to forgo the cost and risk of litigation and distraction to our senior executives.
58492_18_ITEM15_P347_S0	Although there are a number of uncertainties and potential outcomes associated with all of our pending or threatened litigation proceedings, we believe, based on current known facts, that additional losses, if any, are not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
58492_18_ITEM15_P347_S1	However, based upon current known facts, as of December 31, 2017 , aggregate reasonably possible (but not probable, and therefore not accrued) losses in excess of the accruals noted above are estimated to be approximately $22.0 , including approximately $21.0 for Brazilian VAT matters disclosed above and $1.0 for other matters.
58492_18_ITEM15_P347_S2	I f our assumptions or analyses regarding these contingencies are incorrect, or if facts change, we could realize loss in excess of the recorded accruals, and even greater than our estimate of reasonably possible losses in excess of recorded accruals.
