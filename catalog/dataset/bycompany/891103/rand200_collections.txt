891103_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our Search segment consists of toolbars that we develop, market and distribute and destination search and other websites, including Ask.com and Dictionary.com , through which we primarily provide search, reference and content services, as well as CityGrid Media, an online media company that aggregates and integrates local advertising and content for distribution to publishers across web and mobile platforms.
891103_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Search services generally involve the generation and display of a set of hyperlinks to websites, together with summary information regarding these websites, deemed relevant to search queries entered by users.
891103_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries.
891103_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages in response to search queries that contain advertiser-selected keywords.
891103_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	A paid listing is generally a short textual advertising unit containing a link to the website of an advertiser that purchased the relevant keyword(s).
891103_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	The advertiser generally pays a fixed fee every time a user clicks on the paid listing.
891103_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Substantially all of the revenues from our Search segment are derived from the display of paid listings and other advertising in connection with the provision of search and other services.
891103_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	A substantial majority of the paid listings we display are supplied to us by Google pursuant to a paid listing supply agreement with Google that expires on December 31, 2012.
891103_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, we transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to us for display in search results.
891103_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as "sponsored" listings on search results pages.
891103_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	To a lesser extent, we also syndicate Google paid listings through third parties with whom we enter into syndication agreements.
891103_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	advertisers for display on third party and various IAC properties, as well as sell display advertising on our destination and other websites.
891103_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Through Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. ("Mindspark"), we develop, market and distribute a variety of downloadable toolbars through which users can access search services, as well as a variety of applications through which users can creatively and visually express themselves and interact online.
891103_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	The majority of our toolbars consist of a search box (which enables users to run search queries directly from their web browsers), together with applications we have developed that enable users to personalize their online activities and otherwise make them more expressive and fun.
891103_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	These applications include: MyFunCards , through which users can send online greeting cards; Popular Screensavers , through which users can personalize their desktops with photos, images and animations; Webfetti and CursorMania , through which users can personalize pages on various social networking websites; Zwinky , through which users can create avatars to express their persona on the web and design and update profile pages to share with friends; IWON , through which users can access their favorite online games from IWON.com and elsewhere directly from their web browsers; Smiley Central , through which users can add emoticons to e-mails and instant messages; MyWebFace , through which users can create cartoon-like images of themselves for download or use in connection with their profile pages on social networks; and Retrogamer , through which users can access their favorite classic arcade, sports and action games directly from their web browsers.
891103_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	Zwinky also provides users with access to Zwinktopia , a virtual world where avatars created by users can interact through chat and other features, as well as purchase virtual items with virtual currency online.
891103_11_ITEM1_P28_S4	We also develop, market and distribute toolbars that target users with a passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as movies, television, sports and gossip).
891103_11_ITEM1_P28_S5	In addition to a search box feature, these toolbars provide users with the ability to access primarily third party online content and services relating to various vertical categories directly from their web browsers.
891103_11_ITEM1_P28_S6	We distribute these toolbars, as well as those with applications we have developed, to consumers free of charge.
891103_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We also market and distribute Ask.com branded and custom toolbars to third parties through the Ask Partner Network, a leading provider of custom applications and search solutions to software and media companies with web browser add-ons.
891103_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Ask Partner Network works closely with third parties to design and develop highly-targeted, custom toolbars that, when bundled with third party applications and websites, extend services into web browsers and enhance end-user experiences online.
891103_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	"Proprietary" toolbars are generally those that we market and distribute directly to users and "distributed" toolbars are generally those that are marketed and distributed to users through third parties.
891103_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	We also operate a number of destination websites and portals through which we provide search and additional services, including: Ask.com, which provides general search services, as well as question and answer services that provide direct answers to natural-language questions; Dictionary.com , which provides online dictionary search, educational and learning services; IWON.com , which offers a variety of casual games and sweepstakes ; Girlsense.com , which provides a virtual fashion community for girls and teens; MyWay.com , which is free from banner, pop-up and rich-media ads and through which we provide general search and e-mail services; and Excite.com , a content-rich portal that aggregates news, sports, weather and entertainment content.

891103_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Substantially all of the revenues from our toolbars, destination search and other websites and related services are derived from advertising, with the substantial majority of these revenues attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with Google.
891103_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	When a user submits a search query through properties and services within our Search segment and clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and makes a related revenue share payment to us, which we either retain in its entirety or share with third parties.
891103_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	In some cases, Google does not charge advertisers unless our user, after clicking on the paid listing, also takes certain actions on the advertiser's website.
891103_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	To a lesser extent, we also generate revenues from the direct sale of paid listings directly to advertisers on a cost-per-click basis, as well as from the sale of display and other advertising pursuant to a variety of advertising models, including on a fixed fee per impression, cost-per-click and cost-per-action basis.
891103_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to: (i) attract users to our various search properties and search services generally; (ii) develop, market and distribute toolbars and related applications; (iii) attract third parties to distribute our toolbars and search boxes; and (iv) attract advertisers.
891103_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search-centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications), third party toolbar, convenience search and applications providers, other search technology and convenience service providers, including internet access providers, social networks, online advertising networks, traditional media companies and companies that provide online content.
891103_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Moreover, some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	In the case of our Mindspark business, we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars that resonate with consumers (which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features, content and services, some of which may be owned by third parties, with quality search services), differentiate our toolbars from those of our competitors (primarily through providing customized toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars), market and distribute toolbars directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner and secure cost-effective toolbar distribution arrangements with third parties and through other means, as well as attract advertisers.
891103_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	In the case of our destination search websites, we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results and other content, the functionality of our various destination search websites and the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of our services generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors.
891103_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Ask.com from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate, authoritative and direct answers to natural-language questions (in the form of algorithmic search results and/or responses from other Ask.com users).
891103_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	The success of this initiative depends primarily upon our ability to develop a community of Ask.com users with the expertise necessary to provide accurate and authoritative answers to questions, as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative.
891103_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	In the case of the functionality of our various destination search websites and the quality of related content and features, we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering users unique search-related features, such as Ask Eraser , which when activated by users who enter search queries on Ask.com , deletes from our servers search queries and related "cookie" and other information used to track internet activity.
891103_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Through CityGrid, we aggregate local business listings, advertising and content, including editorial and other user-generated content and related information ("CityGrid Advertising"), which we then distribute to websites and mobile applications affiliated with CityGrid.
891103_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Websites and mobile applications affiliated with CityGrid include third party websites and mobile applications, as well as the websites and applications we own and operate described below (the "CityGrid Properties").
891103_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	CityGrid Media also owns and operates Citysearch.com , InsiderPages.com and Urbanspoon.com , websites (and related mobile applications in the case of Citysearch.com and Urbanspoon.com ) that connect consumers with local businesses by providing consumers with free access to local business profiles, customized messages from local businesses, reviews and user-generated content and related information.
891103_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Citysearch.com is a comprehensive directory of local business listings and related information across all verticals of businesses in the United States.
891103_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	InsiderPages.com publishes content regarding professional service providers based in the United States.
891103_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	Urbanspoon.com publishes content focused exclusively on restaurants and dining in North America, the United Kingdom and Australia.
891103_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	CityGrid Advertising is sold to local businesses through direct sales and resellers.
891103_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	In the case of direct sales, we sell CityGrid Advertising directly to local businesses through field sales teams in major metropolitan areas within the United States, as well as through an in-house national sales team and an online self-enrollment model.
891103_11_ITEM1_P43_S2	CityGrid Advertising is also sold through resellers (third parties with their own independent advertising sales forces).
891103_11_ITEM1_P43_S3	CityGrid Advertising is then published on CityGrid Properties.
891103_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	The substantial majority of CityGrid Media revenues are generated through the sale of CityGrid Advertising to local businesses through direct sales and resellers.
891103_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	In the case of direct sales, advertising is sold primarily pursuant to a pay-for-performance-based model.
891103_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	Under this model, local businesses pay CityGrid Media a fee each time their enhanced business listing (or select information from such listing) is viewed on a CityGrid Property or a user calls a metered number to reach a business.
891103_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	In the case of resellers, advertisers pay resellers for CityGrid Advertising, which resellers in turn share the revenues received with CityGrid Media pursuant to a variety of models, the specifics of which vary by reseller and the substantial majority of which have some performance-based element.
891103_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	When we publish CityGrid Advertising on our owned and operated properties, we retain all of the revenues (whether generated from direct sales or resellers).
891103_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	receive with the applicable third party CityGrid Property.
891103_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Revenues are also generated through our sale of local merchant and national display advertising on our owned and operated properties on a per impression and fixed fee basis.
891103_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	The markets for local business advertising and content are highly competitive and diverse.
891103_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	We primarily compete with online and offline local and national directories and new online and mobile advertising services and networks.
891103_11_ITEM1_P48_S2	We also face competition from search engines and other site aggregation companies that aggregate our content for display on their websites, which interferes with search engine optimization and marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to CityGrid Properties.
891103_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Through the brands and businesses within our Match segment, we are a leading provider of subscription-based and advertiser-supported online personals services in the United States and various jurisdictions abroad.
891103_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	We provide these services through websites that we own and operate in twenty-five countries, in seven languages and on four continents, as well as through our mobile applications.
891103_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	Through Match.com , we also own a 27% interest in Meetic, a European online dating company based in France, and a 50% interest in a venture with Meetic, through which we provide online personals services in certain countries in Latin America.
891103_11_ITEM1_P49_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we collectively provided online personals services to approximately 1.6 million subscribers.
891103_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	In April 2010, we entered into an agreement with Yahoo!, pursuant to which Match.com became the exclusive online dating website on Yahoo.com .
891103_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	In February 2010 and February 2011, respectively, we acquired Singlesnet.com and OKCupid.com , two advertiser-supported online personals services in the United States.
891103_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	We primarily provide online personals services through branded websites that we own and operate, including Match.com , Chemistry.com , SeniorPeopleMeet.com , BlackPeopleMeet.com , Singlesnet.com and OKCupid.com .
891103_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	These websites, all of which provide single adults with a private and convenient environment for meeting other single adults, primarily provide online personals services to registered members (those establishing usernames and passwords) and subscribers (those who establish a username and password and pay a subscription fee).
891103_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	Within our portfolio of websites, we have both subscription-based and advertising-supported offerings.
891103_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Our subscription-based websites offer registered members the ability to post a profile and use any related searching and matching tools free of charge, while subscribers have access to enhanced tools and a broader feature set, including the ability to initiate, review or respond to communications from other users.
891103_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	Our subscription programs generally start with a single-month term, with discounts for longer term subscriptions.
891103_11_ITEM1_P52_S3	Our advertiser-supported websites generally provide online personals services with basic functionality without the commitment of a monthly subscription, in some cases making a variety of premium or add-on features available for a fee.
891103_11_ITEM1_P52_S4	We also offer access to our services via mobile phones and other mobile devices through our matchMobile service and other branded mobile applications.
891103_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	We market our services through a wide variety of offline and online marketing activities.
891103_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Our offline marketing activities consist of traditional marketing and business development activities, including television, print, radio and outdoor advertising and related public relations efforts.
891103_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	e-mail campaigns and search engine marketing.
891103_11_ITEM1_P54_S1	In addition, we enter into a variety of alliances with third parties who advertise and promote our services.
891103_11_ITEM1_P54_S2	Some alliances are exclusive and some, but not all, contain renewal provisions.
891103_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	Our revenues are derived from subscription fees for our subscription-based online personals and related services and online advertising.
891103_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	The personals business is very competitive and highly fragmented in the United States and abroad and barriers to entry are minimal.
891103_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	We compete primarily with online and offline broad-based personals, dating and matchmaking services (both free and paid), social networking websites, the personals sections of newspapers and magazines, other conventional media companies that provide personals services and traditional venues where singles meet (both online and offline).
891103_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	We also compete with numerous online and offline personals, dating and matchmaking services that cater to specific demographic groups.
891103_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	the size and diversity of our registered member and subscriber bases relative to those of our competitors; the functionality of our websites and the attractiveness of their features and our services generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors; how quickly we can enhance our existing technology and services and/or develop new features and services in response to:
891103_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	our ability to engage in cost-effective marketing efforts, including by way of maintaining relationships with third parties with which we have entered into alliances, and the recognition and strength of our various brands relative to those of our competitors.
891103_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	ServiceMagic is a leading online marketplace in the United States that connects consumers, by way of patented proprietary technologies, with home and other local service professionals, all of which are pre-screened and the majority of which are customer-rated.
891103_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	When consumers submit a service request through the ServiceMagic marketplace, ServiceMagic generally matches them with up to four members from its network of service professionals, which as of December 31, 2010, consisted of more than 82,000 service professionals in the United States providing services in more than 700 categories, primarily home service-related, ranging from simple home repairs to complete home building and home remodeling projects, as well as other local services, including photography and event planning.
891103_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	Through ServiceMagic International, we search for local lead generation business opportunities around the world and made a majority investment in ServiceMagic Europe, which operates businesses in the local lead generation space in France and the United Kingdom, including Travaux.com , a leading French website for consumer information regarding home improvement; 123Devis.com , a French lead generation business with one of the largest networks of tradespeople in France; and 123GetAQuote.co.uk , a leading lead generation platform for home service and trade professionals in the United Kingdom.

891103_11_ITEM1_P62_S5	Consumers that visit this site are ultimately matched to a service professional by way of our Exact Match service or, if a match cannot be made through this service, by way of our Market Match service.
891103_11_ITEM1_P62_S6	We also offer website design and hosting services for our service professionals through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Market Hardware.
891103_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	In all cases, if a match is made through our services, consumers are under no obligation to work with service professionals referred by ServiceMagic.
891103_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	In addition, if we are unable to match a consumer with service professionals from our network, we may provide the consumer with contact information concerning service professionals outside of our network.
891103_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	In addition to our matching services, consumers may also access our online library of service-related resources, which primarily include articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, and related tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects, and general advice for working with service professionals.
891103_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	We market our services to consumers primarily through search engine marketing, as well as through affiliate agreements with third parties.
891103_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and the services of our member service professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website (on a cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to our website (on a cost-per-click basis).
891103_11_ITEM1_P65_S2	We also market our services to consumers through the purchase of paid listings displayed in yellow page directories, portals and contextual home improvement related sites and, to a lesser extent, through traditional offline advertising.
891103_11_ITEM1_P65_S3	We market our services to service professionals through our sales force, which obtains information concerning service professionals through a variety of sources.
891103_11_ITEM1_P65_S4	We also promote online enrollment in our network through search engine marketing, relationships with trade associations and affiliate marketing relationships.
891103_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	provides the requested service, as well as from one-time fees charged upon enrollment and activation of new service professionals in our network.
891103_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	Lead fees vary based upon the service requested, with fees for leads generated through our Exact Match service being greater than those for leads generated through our Market Match service.
891103_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	Our revenues are also generated, to a lesser extent, from fees paid by service professionals for website development and hosting services provided by MarketHardware.
891103_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	We currently compete with other service-related lead generation services, primarily home service-related services, as well as with internet directories and local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories.
891103_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services.
891103_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	the size, quality (as determined, in part, by reference to our pre-screening efforts and customer ratings and reviews), diversity and stability of our network of service professionals and the quality of services provided by these professionals; our continued ability to deliver consumer leads that convert into revenues for our network of service professionals in a cost-effective manner; and the functionality of our websites and the attractiveness of their features and our services generally to consumers and service professionals, as well as our ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals.
891103_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our Media Other segment currently consists primarily of Electus, Connected Ventures, Vimeo, Pronto, Shoebuy and Proust.com .

891103_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	As of December 31, 2010, IAC and its subsidiaries employed approximately 3,200 full-time employees.
891103_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	IAC believes that it generally has good employee relationships, including relationships with employees represented by unions or other similar organizations.
891103_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Company maintains a website at www.iac.com .
891103_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Neither the information on the Company's website, nor the information on the website of any IAC business, is incorporated by reference in this report, or in any other filings with, or in any other information furnished or submitted to, the SEC.
891103_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	The Company makes available, free of charge through its website, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (including related amendments) as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
891103_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	The Company's code of ethics, as amended in April 2009, applies to all employees (including all executive officers and senior financial officers (including IAC's CFO and Controller)) and directors and is posted on the Company's website at www.iac.com/newiaccodeofethics.pdf .
891103_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	The code of ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC Regulation S-K and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The use of words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "intends," "plans" and "believes," among others, generally identify forward looking statements.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These forward looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC's anticipated financial performance, IAC's business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the various industries in which IAC businesses operate, new products, services and related strategies and other similar matters.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These forward looking statements are based on management's current expectations and assumptions about future events, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements included in this report for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the risk factors set forth below.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC's business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward looking statements discussed in this report may not prove to be accurate.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this report.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	IAC does not undertake to update these forward looking statements.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Mr. Diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board or Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As of January 31, 2011, Mr. Diller owned approximately 4.3 million shares of IAC Class B common stock representing 100% of IAC's outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 33.8% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Mr. Diller may acquire additional shares of IAC Class B common stock through the exercise of an exchange right, pursuant to which he may exchange with IAC, on a one-for-one basis, from time to time until September 1, 2011, up to 1.5 million shares of IAC common stock he acquires in the open market or otherwise for shares of IAC Class B common stock currently held in treasury by IAC.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement among IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC's ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	While Mr. Diller may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case IAC would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller's ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller currently is in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC's Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse changes in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with Google that expires on December 31, 2012.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our search services that contain keywords selected and purchased by advertisers through Google.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search-related services.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to the advertiser) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our search services and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Changes to Google's paid listings network efficiency or its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our search services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our paid listing supply agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its services and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, specifically, the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display Google paid listings within search results.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could in turn require modifications to (or prohibit certain of) our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Noncompliance with Google's guidelines by us or third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings could, if not cured, result in Google's suspension of some or all services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners, the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by Google.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The termination of the paid listing supply agreement by Google or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	General economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to advertising.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We believe that the continued growth and continued acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting), the continued growth in commercial use of the internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure and/or opt-in policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We depend, in part, upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into users and customers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	How successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	For example, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes to users through third parties.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These agreements are generally not exclusive, are short term in nature and are terminable by either party upon notice.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Our inability to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute our toolbars and search boxes through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic, queries and advertising revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In addition, in the case of the businesses within our Match segment, we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Pursuant to these arrangements, third parties generally promote our services on their websites and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register on our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	These arrangements are generally not exclusive, are short term in nature and are terminable by either party given notice.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	If existing arrangements with third parties are terminated (or are not renewed upon their expiration) and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues, or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with third parties in response to industry trends, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In the case of our ServiceMagic business, our ability to drive traffic depends, in part, on the nature and number of service professionals who are members of our service provider network.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	While these professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long term contracts with them.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, a significant number of our service professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	As a result, our network of service professionals may experience turnover from time to time, which if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to ServiceMagic.com and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties, we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly and/or in cost-effective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements and/or new products or services to the market.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users, customers and revenues, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	As discussed below, our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing, as well as for the development and introduction of new products, services and enhancements, infrastructure and other related efforts.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	In the case of our search engine marketing efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase, as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally, which would increase our costs.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In the case of paid advertising generally, the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	One of the most cost-effective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	SEO involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The failure to successfully manage SEO efforts across our businesses, including the timely modification of SEO efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, any or all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In addition, search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, which would result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, any or all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Lastly, as discussed above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Any failure to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing industry standards.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The e-commerce industry is characterized by evolving industry standards, coupled with frequent and related new product and service introductions and enhancements.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The development of new product and service introductions and enhancements in response to evolving industry standards requires significant time and resources and we may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-effective manner) to these changes or appropriately time the introduction of new products, services and enhancements to the market and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The continued widespread adoption of new internet and telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, services and proprietary technologies obsolete, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	For example, user and usage volumes on mobile devices continue to increase relative to those of personal computers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The lower resolution, functionality, display limitations and memory associated with mobile devices could make the use of our various services through these devices difficult.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P38_S3	While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our services, we have limited experience with these applications and they may not be compelling to users.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Furthermore, existing agreements across our business may need to be amended to cover the provision of our services on mobile devices, which the counterparties may be unwilling to do.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Furthermore, in the case of certain of our search services, third parties have introduced (and continue to introduce) new technologies.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	applications and policies that may interfere with the ability of our users to access or utilize some of our services generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services (such as through the introduction and features and/or processes that make the access and use of our services cumbersome relative to those of our competitors).
891103_11_ITEM1A_P39_S2	For example, third parties have introduced technologies and applications that prevent users from downloading toolbars generally and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will download our toolbars and that previously downloaded toolbars will remain in active use, such as features that interfere with the functionality of search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and other settings previously selected by users.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Third parties have also introduced technologies and applications that are either not compatible with (or otherwise interfere with) the "search assistant" function embedded within our toolbars, pursuant to which our toolbars generate search results for users that receive "DNS," "404" and other errors in response to search queries entered into search boxes embedded within our toolbars or the address bar of their web browsers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P39_S4	These technologies and applications adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our toolbars, which in turn adversely impacts our revenues.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Our failure to successfully modify our toolbars in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Although we believe our tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	To the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems; retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and successfully manage acquisition-related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and/or acquired businesses.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We operate in certain international markets in which we have limited experience, and as a result, face additional risks.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into existing, international markets.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We currently operate in a limited number of jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the U.S.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our services to the unique customs and cultures of these jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Operating abroad, where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	For example, we may experience difficulties in managing operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures, the staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms, given that we could encounter significant barriers to entry in connection with expansion efforts outside of these arrangements.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value-added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the type of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P52_S2	For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Claims could be threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our products and services, or content generated by us and our users.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	In addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing or linking to third party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Those of our businesses that mention or otherwise incorporate copyrighted material into the content they produce also rely on fair use principles, which allow limited use of copyrighted materials without having to obtain the consent of the copyright holder, provided we satisfy certain legal criteria.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Also, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	We face similar risks and costs as our products, services and content are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to consumers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities and while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our various businesses.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	There are currently pending several bills in the U.S. Congress, which if passed could result in more onerous requirements regarding the manner in which certain personally identifiable information and other user data will need to be stored and managed.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Additionally, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission released a staff report in December 2010 in which it proposed a new framework for addressing commercial use of consumer data.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	could be costly to implement, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that otherwise negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P62_S2	The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other similar intellectual property, as critical to our success.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P64_S1	For example, the businesses within our principal reporting segments, our Search, Match and ServiceMagic reporting segments, rely heavily upon their trademarks (primarily Ask.com , our various toolbar brands, Match.com and ServiceMagic.com and related domain names and logos), through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P64_S2	So long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew related trademarks upon their expiration, they will continue to have related trademark protections indefinitely under current trademark laws, rules and regulations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The businesses within our Search segment also rely heavily upon trade secrets, primarily search algorithms through which organic search results are generated.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	To a lesser extent, these businesses also rely upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies and processes, primarily those relating to search-related products and services, with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2027, and copyrighted material, primarily emoticons, characters and other content that is incorporated into, and used in connection with the marketing of, toolbars generally.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Our Match segment also relies upon patent-pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features, products and services.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Our ServiceMagic segment also relies heavily upon trade secrets, primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of local service professionals are matched with consumers, as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Despite these precautions, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brand names and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure and those of third parties.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our businesses.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	To succeed, our systems and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing services, which could adversely affect our business.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Moreover, as traffic to our various websites increases and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructure and technologies generally to facilitate this growth.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If we do not do so or if we experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, users, customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our services on an intermittent or prolonged basis and the quality of their experiences could be adversely affected.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Moreover, even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems, infrastructure and technology needed in order to access our services on a timely basis, if at all.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P73_S5	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with customers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide services and/or process certain transactions with customers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Furthermore, data security breaches (as a result of the actions of hackers or otherwise), fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Any event of this nature could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P74_S4	While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P74_S5	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	In particular, our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent, surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs, applications and activity that make changes to users' computers and interfere with the overall experience of our services, such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	disclosure to or consent from users, resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	These disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable, may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P76_S2	In addition, downloadable toolbars through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users' computer or in our systems and networks.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P76_S3	No assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful and/or that our products and services will not have (or will not be perceived to have) vulnerabilities in this regard.
891103_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.
891103_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	IAC believes that the facilities for its management and operations are generally adequate for its current and near-term future needs.
891103_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	IAC's facilities, most of which are leased by IAC's businesses in various cities and locations in the United States and jurisdictions abroad, generally consist of executive and administrative offices, operations centers, data centers and sales offices.
891103_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	All of IAC's leases are at prevailing market rates.
891103_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	IAC believes that the duration of each lease is adequate.
891103_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	IAC believes that its principal properties, whether owned or leased, are currently adequate for the purposes for which they are used and are suitably maintained for these purposes.
891103_11_ITEM2_P2_S3	IAC does not anticipate any future problems renewing or obtaining suitable leases for its principal properties.
891103_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	IAC's approximately 202,500 square foot corporate headquarters in New York, New York houses offices for IAC corporate and certain other IAC businesses.
891103_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property and other claims.
891103_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage.
891103_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrant's business, and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
891103_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	In the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation matters which the Company and its subsidiaries are defending, including those described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude.
891103_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to the Company's shareholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to the financial position or operations of the Company based upon the standard set forth in the SEC's rules.
891103_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	As previously disclosed in a number of the Company's filings on SEC Forms 10-K and 10-Q, beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against IAC and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations of the federal securities laws.
891103_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	These cases arose out of the Company's August 4, 2004 announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value of the Company's stock was artificially inflated by pre-announcement statements about its financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants' alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by the Company's travel businesses (which in 2005 were spun off into a separate public company, Expedia, Inc.).
891103_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	On December 20, 2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits, appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead plaintiffs' counsel.
891103_11_ITEM3_P2_S3	See In re IAC/InterActiveCorp Securities Litigation , No. 04-CV-7447 (S.D.N.Y.).
891103_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative action, Stuart Garber, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al. , No. 04-603416, was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New York County) against certain of IAC's officers and directors.
891103_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	On November 15, 2004, another related shareholder derivative action, Lisa Butler, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al. , No. 04-CV-9067, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of IAC's current and former directors.
891103_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	On January 24, 2005, the federal district court consolidated the Butler case with the securities class action for pre-trial purposes only.
891103_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	On February 2, 2005, the defendants in the Garber case removed it from New York state court to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
891103_11_ITEM3_P3_S4	On April 11, 2005, the district court issued a similar consolidation order in respect of the Garber case.
891103_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	On May 20, 2005, the plaintiffs in the federal securities class action filed a consolidated amended complaint.
891103_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	Like its twelve predecessors, the amended complaint generally alleged that the value of the Company's stock was artificially inflated by pre-announcement statements about the Company's financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the defendants' alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by the Company's then travel businesses.
891103_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	The plaintiffs sought to represent a class of shareholders who purchased IAC common stock between March 31, 2003 and August 3, 2004.
891103_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	The defendants were IAC and fourteen current or former officers or directors of the Company or its former Expedia travel business.

891103_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data for the five years ended December 31, 2010 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included herein.
891103_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	IAC is a leading internet company with more than 50 brands serving consumer audiences across more than 30 countries our mission is to harness the power of interactivity to make daily life easier and more productive for people all over the world.
891103_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	IAC includes the businesses comprising its Search segment; its Match and ServiceMagic segments; the businesses comprising its Media Other segment; as well as investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
891103_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Set forth below are the contributions made by our various segments and corporate operations to consolidated revenue, operating income (loss) and Operating Income Before Amortization (as defined in IAC's Principles of Financial Reporting) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands).
891103_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliations by segment of Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss).
891103_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Substantially all of the revenue from our Search segment is derived from online advertising, with the majority of this revenue attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with Google Inc. ("Google").
891103_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The revenue earned from our Match segment is derived from subscription fees for its subscription-based online personals services and online advertising.
891103_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	ServiceMagic's revenue is derived from fees paid by members of its network of service professionals for consumer leads, regardless of whether the service professional that receives the lead ultimately provides the requested service, as well as from one-time fees charged upon enrollment and activation of new service professionals in its network.
891103_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	The revenue earned by the Media Other segment includes merchandise sales, online advertising and content production.
891103_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our various businesses provide supplier partners with important customer acquisition channels and we believe that the ability of our supplier partners to reach a large qualified audience through our services is a significant benefit.
891103_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	While we aim to build and maintain strong relationships with our supplier partners, we may not succeed in these efforts and there is always the risk that certain supplier partners may not make their products and services available to us in the future.
891103_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	A significant component of the Company's revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with Google, which expires on December 31, 2012.
891103_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	The termination of the paid listing supply agreement by Google or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, revenue earned from Google was $727.9 million, $561.9 million and $610.7 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The majority of this revenue is earned by the businesses comprising the Search segment.
891103_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	We market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and membership programs, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner.
891103_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
891103_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We pay traffic acquisition costs which consist of payments made to partners who distribute our toolbars, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites.
891103_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels, such as internet portals and search engines.
891103_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	In addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned.
891103_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	These distribution channels might also offer their own products and services, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
891103_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	The cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased, particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the segments in which IAC's businesses operate increases.
891103_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Revenue in 2010 increased $290.1 million from 2009 primarily as a result of revenue increases of $155.4 million from Search, $58.1 million from Match, $51.1 million from Media Other and $25.6 million from ServiceMagic.
891103_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Revenue reflects double digit growth across all segments.
891103_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	The increase from Search reflects growth in queries from distributed and proprietary toolbars and destination websites.
891103_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	The increase in revenue from Match reflects strong growth from the domestic business, including the combined contribution from People Media, acquired July 13, 2009, and Singlesnet, acquired March 2, 2010, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the sale of Match Europe to Meetic, on June 5, 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	Also contributing to the increase in revenue from Match is the impact of Match's venture with Meetic in Latin America, which was formed March 10, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P10_S5	The increase in revenue from Media Other was driven by the contribution from Notional and Electus, which were not in the full prior year period, and growth at Pronto, Shoebuy, CollegeHumor and Vimeo.
891103_11_ITEM7_P10_S6	The increase in revenue from ServiceMagic was primarily due to an increase in accepted domestic service requests driven primarily by increased marketing efforts and a more active service provider network.
891103_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Revenue in 2009 decreased $63.4 million from 2008 primarily as a result of revenue decreases of $71.3 million from Search and $22.9 million from Match, partially offset by an increase of $31.9 million from ServiceMagic.
891103_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The decrease from Search was driven by a sharp decline in network revenue, resulting from the discontinuation of relationships with certain partners that took place during 2008 in conjunction with the renewed Google agreement.
891103_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Partially offsetting this decline is the continued growth in partners and queries at the toolbar business and the favorable impact in 2009 from the acquisition of Lexico, which includes Dictionary.com and Thesaurus.com, on July 3, 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	The decrease in revenue at Match was driven by the sale of Match Europe to Meetic, partially offset by the favorable impact from the acquisition of People Media and solid growth in the U.S. business.
891103_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	The increase in revenue from ServiceMagic was primarily due to a more active service provider network resulting in a 25% increase in the number of times service requests were accepted by a service professional and a shift in the mix of requests to higher value service requests driven, in part, by increased marketing efforts.
891103_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Cost of revenue consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs.
891103_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	Traffic acquisition costs consist of payments made to partners who distribute our toolbars, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites.
891103_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements.
891103_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	Cost of revenue also includes the cost of products sold and shipping and handling costs, as well as expenses associated with the operation of the Company's data centers, including compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel engaged in data center functions, rent, energy and bandwidth costs, and content acquisition costs.
891103_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cost of revenue in 2010 increased $164.0 million from 2009 primarily due to increases of $121.6 million from Search, $27.7 million from Media Other and $10.3 million from Match.
891103_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in cost of revenue from Search was primarily due to an increase of $108.5 million in traffic acquisition costs related to an increase in revenue.
891103_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	As a percentage of revenue, traffic acquisition costs increased over the prior year due to an increase in the proportion of revenue from distributed toolbars and other arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to our websites, as well as a shift in partner mix to partners carrying higher traffic acquisition costs.
891103_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	Cost of revenue from Media Other increased due to Notional, which is not in the full prior year period, The Daily Beast and an increase of $6.0 million in the cost of products sold at Shoebuy due to increased sales.
891103_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	The increase in cost of revenue from Match was primarily due to the acquisitions of People Media and Singlesnet and the formation of the Latin America venture, partially offset by the sale of Match Europe to Meetic.
891103_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Cost of revenue in 2009 decreased $27.1 million from 2008 primarily due to decreases of $20.7 million from Match and $6.5 million from Media Other.
891103_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The decrease in cost of revenue from Match was primarily due to a decrease of $20.0 million in traffic acquisition costs resulting primarily from the sale of Match Europe and the impact of more favorable economic terms under agreements with certain distribution partners.
891103_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Cost of revenue from Media Other decreased primarily due to the sale of ReserveAmerica on January 31, 2009, partially offset by The Daily Beast, as well as an increase of $3.0 million in the cost of products sold at Shoebuy due to increased sales.
891103_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures and compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel engaged in sales, sales support and customer service functions.

891103_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase in selling and marketing expense from ServiceMagic is due to increases of $14.0 million and $7.0 million in marketing and compensation and other employee-related costs, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	The increase in compensation and other employee-related costs from ServiceMagic is primarily due to the expansion of its sales force.
891103_11_ITEM7_P16_S3	The increase in selling and marketing expense from Match is primarily due to an increase of $13.3 million in advertising and promotional expenditures related primarily to a new advertising agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2010 with Yahoo! Inc. ("Yahoo"), as well as from the impact of the acquisitions of People Media and Singlesnet and the formation of the Latin America venture, partially offset by the sale of Match Europe to Meetic.
891103_11_ITEM7_P16_S4	Selling and marketing expense from Media Other increased primarily due to higher online marketing costs at Pronto and advertising and promotional expenditures related to Vimeo's 2010 video festival.
891103_11_ITEM7_P16_S5	Partially offsetting these factors is a decrease from Search primarily due to lower advertising and promotional expenditures of $7.2 million, as the prior year included expenditures associated with the NASCAR partnership and an ad campaign to rebrand the Ask Jeeves UK website, as well as a decrease in compensation and other employee-related costs at CityGrid Media, due in part, to a decrease in average headcount.
891103_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Selling and marketing expense in 2009 increased $18.9 million from 2008 primarily due to an increase of $25.1 million from ServiceMagic, partially offset by a decrease of $10.2 million from Match.

891103_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	The growth in service requests during the year from paid channels outpaced the growth in free requests as a result of the increase in online marketing.
891103_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	Partially offsetting these increases in selling and marketing expense is lower advertising and promotional expenditures of $7.8 million from Match.
891103_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	This decrease is due primarily to the sale of Match Europe, partially offset by an increase in online marketing.
891103_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax and human resources, facilities costs and fees for professional services.
891103_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	General and administrative expense in 2010 increased $34.1 million from 2009 primarily due to increases of $12.4 million from corporate, $10.5 million from Media Other, $5.6 million from ServiceMagic and $5.5 million from Search.
891103_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	General and administrative expense from corporate increased primarily due to an increase of $10.3 million in non-cash compensation expense and $5.3 million of transaction expenses in the current year related to the exchange of substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation's ("Liberty") equity stake in IAC, partially offset by lower salary expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	On December 1, 2010, the Company entered into a stock exchange agreement with Liberty.
891103_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	$217.9 million in cash (referred to herein as the "Liberty Exchange").
891103_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in non-cash compensation expense is primarily related to an increase in expense attributable to awards granted subsequent to the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by awards having become fully vested.
891103_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	The increase in general and administrative expense from Media Other is principally due to Electus and Notional, which were not in the full prior year period, as well as increased operating expenses associated with Vimeo, partially offset by the cost savings related to certain businesses that have been sold or shutdown.
891103_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	General and administrative expense at ServiceMagic increased primarily due to higher compensation and other employee-related costs.
891103_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	The increase in general and administrative expense from Search is primarily due to an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs at our toolbar business and employee termination costs associated with the Ask.com restructuring, partially offset by a decrease in litigation related expenses.
891103_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	General and administrative expense in 2009 decreased $64.2 million from 2008 primarily due to a decrease of $66.1 million from corporate.
891103_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	The decrease from corporate is primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of $42.0 million in expenses related to the Spin-Off, as well as a decrease in the current year in compensation and other employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation.
891103_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	The decrease in non-cash compensation of $16.4 million reflects the impact in 2008 of the acceleration and modification of certain equity awards associated with the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	Product development expense consists primarily of compensation and other employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related technology.
891103_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Product development expense in 2010 increased $7.3 million from 2009 primarily due to increases of $3.3 million from Match and $2.3 million from Search.
891103_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	Contributing to the increase in product development expense at Match is an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs driven by growth in headcount related to recent acquisitions.
891103_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The increase in product development expense from Search is primarily due to the inclusion in the current year of employee termination costs associated with the Ask.com restructuring.
891103_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Product development expense in 2009 decreased $6.0 million from 2008 primarily due to a decrease of $4.9 million in compensation and other employee-related costs from Search which is due in part to a decrease of 7% in average headcount at IAC Search Media and an increase in costs being capitalized in 2009 related to IAC Search Media's product offerings and related technology.
891103_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	Depreciation in 2010 increased $2.5 million from 2009 primarily due to the write-off of certain capitalized software costs associated with the Ask.com restructuring.
891103_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Depreciation in 2009 decreased $6.3 million from 2008 primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated, partially offset by the incremental depreciation associated with capital expenditures made during 2009 and 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization in 2010 increased $67.7 million from 2009 primarily due to increases of $33.9 million and $27.9 million from Search and Match, respectively, and reduced losses of $7.7 million at Media Other.
891103_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The increase in Operating Income Before Amortization reflects higher revenue across these segments, as well as lower marketing costs from Search, a reduction in acquisition related expenses from Match and cost savings related to certain businesses that have been sold or shutdown and the profit participations related to our interests in Reveille from Media Other.
891103_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization in 2009 increased $5.7 million from 2008 primarily due to a decrease of $55.5 million in corporate expenses due in part to the inclusion in 2008 of $42.0 million in expenses related to the Spin-Off and a decrease in compensation and other employee-related costs.
891103_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	Partially offsetting these increases in Operating Income Before Amortization is a decrease of $53.3 million from Search resulting primarily from lower overall revenue and higher traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue.
891103_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	Operating income in 2010 increased $1.1 billion from 2009 primarily due to a decrease of $888.8 million in goodwill impairment charges described below and an increase of $67.7 million in Operating Income Before Amortization described above.
891103_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Further contributing to the increase in operating income are decreases of $16.8 million in amortization of intangibles, exclusive of the impairment charges noted below, and $15.9 million in amortization of non-cash marketing, partially offset by an increase of $14.2 million in non-cash compensation expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	The decrease in amortization of intangibles is primarily due to a decrease at Search, partially offset by an increase at Match relating to the acquisition of Singlesnet and its venture formed with Meetic in Latin America.
891103_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The amortization of non-cash marketing referred to in this report consists of non-cash advertising credits secured from Universal Television as part of the transaction pursuant to which Vivendi Universal Entertainment, LLLP ("VUE") was created, and the subsequent transaction by which IAC sold its partnership interests in VUE.
891103_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	The increase in non-cash compensation expense is primarily related to an increase in expense attributable to awards granted subsequent to the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by awards having become fully vested.
891103_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there was $137.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.2 years.
891103_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In connection with the Company's annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges at the Media Other segment related to the write-down of the goodwill and intangible assets of Shoebuy of $28.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively, and at the Search segment related to the write-down of an indefinite-lived intangible asset of IAC Search Media of $11.0 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges at Shoebuy reflect expectations of lower revenue and profit performance in future years due to Shoebuy's 2010 fourth quarter revenue and profit performance, which is its seasonally strongest quarter.
891103_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at IAC Search Media is primarily due to lower future revenue projections associated with a trade name and trademark based largely upon the impact of 2010's full year results.
891103_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges at the Search segment related to the write-down of the goodwill and intangible assets of IAC Search Media of $916.9 million and $128.3 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The impairments reflected lower projections for revenue and profits at IAC Search Media in future years that reflected the Company's consideration of industry growth rates, competitive dynamics and IAC Search Media's operating strategies and the impact of these factors on the fair value of IAC Search Media and its goodwill and intangible assets.
891103_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges related to the write-down of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of Connected Ventures, which is included in the Media Other segment, of $11.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively, and the indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Search segment of $9.2 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	The impairment at Connected Ventures resulted from the Company's assessment of its future profitability.
891103_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The impairment at the Search segment primarily resulted from the decline in revenue and profitability at IAC Search Media's Excite, iWon and MyWay portals businesses.
891103_11_ITEM7_P35_S3	The intangible asset impairment charges are included in amortization of intangibles in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_11_ITEM7_P35_S4	The intangible asset impairment charges were determined by comparing the fair values of the respective reporting unit's intangible assets with the carrying values.
891103_11_ITEM7_P35_S5	The goodwill impairment charges were determined by comparing the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P35_S6	Fair values were determined using discounted cash flow analyses.
891103_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Operating loss in 2009 increased $993.7 million from 2008 primarily due to the impairment charges described above.
891103_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Partially offsetting this increase in operating loss is an increase of $5.7 million in Operating Income Before Amortization described above and the decreases of $15.7 million in non-cash compensation expense, $4.1 million in amortization of non-cash marketing and $1.7 million in amortization of intangibles, exclusive of the impairment charges described above.
891103_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	The decrease in non-cash compensation expense is primarily due to the expense in the prior year related to the acceleration and modification of certain equity awards associated with the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Interest income in 2010 decreased $3.7 million from 2009 primarily due to the impact of lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates.
891103_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates in 2010 increased $11.7 million from 2009 primarily due to an $18.3 million impairment charge to write-down the Company's investment in The HealthCentral Network, Inc. ("HealthCentral") to fair value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	The decline in value was determined to be other-than-temporary due to HealthCentral's continued losses and negative operating cash flows, which are due, in part, to macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	The valuation of our investment in HealthCentral reflects the Company's assessment of these factors.
891103_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	The Company estimated the fair value of its investment in HealthCentral using a multiple of revenue approach in the context of a different valuation environment than that which prevailed when our initial investment was made.
891103_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	Equity in (losses) income of unconsolidated affiliates also includes reduced losses related to the Company's investment in Meetic due, in part, to a decrease in amortization of intangibles.
891103_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Gain on sale of long-term investments in 2010 represents a gain of $4.0 million related to the sale of our remaining shares of OpenTable.
891103_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	Other expense in 2010 of $6.5 million is primarily due to a $7.8 million impairment charge related to the Company's cost method investment in Zip Express Installation ("Zip").
891103_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The impairment charge was determined to be other-than-temporary due to Zip's inability to achieve its 2010 cash flow forecast during its seasonally strongest fourth quarter and the Company's assessment that Zip would be unable to continue to operate without new outside funding.
891103_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Interest income in 2009 decreased $14.5 million from 2008 primarily due to the impact of lower average interest rates resulting, in part, from a reallocation of investments during the second half of 2008 into lower risk and lower yield treasury and government agency funds, partially offset by higher average investment balances throughout the year.
891103_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	Interest expense in 2009 decreased $26.5 million from 2008 as the average amount of debt outstanding during the year decreased due to the extinguishment of $734.2 million of the Senior Notes.
891103_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Equity in (losses) income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2009 decreased $30.7 million from 2008 primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of $29.8 million related to the equity in earnings of our former investment in Jupiter Shop Channel Co., Ltd. ("Jupiter Shop"), a Japanese TV shopping company, and a loss of $5.5 million from the Company's investment in Meetic, which is not in the 2008 period.
891103_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The loss from the investment in Meetic is due to the write-off of Meetic's deferred revenue and the amortization of intangibles, required by purchase accounting rules.
891103_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	Equity in (losses) income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2008 included a $5.5 million impairment charge to write-down an equity method investment to its fair value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	The decline in value was determined to be other-than-temporary due to the equity method investee's operating losses, negative operating cash flow and the resulting need for changes to the investee's existing business model.
891103_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	The resulting valuation of the investee also reflected the assessment of market conditions and the investee's ability to successfully restructure.
891103_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	Gain on sales of long-term investments in 2009 of $28.8 million primarily represents a gain of $39.6 million related to the Company's sale of 2.0 million shares of OpenTable.
891103_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	Partially offsetting this gain is a loss of $12.3 million related to the Company's sale of 5.5 million shares of Arcandor AG ("ARO") stock, which the Company received as part of the consideration for the sale of HSE in June 2007; the Company also received a contingent value right ("CVR") in conjunction with the sale of HSE.
891103_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Other income in 2009 of $71.8 million is primarily due to a $132.2 million gain related to the June 5, 2009 sale of Match Europe to Meetic.
891103_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	In exchange for its European operations, Match received a 27% stake in Meetic.
891103_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	Partially offsetting the increase in other income in 2009 are charges of $58.1 million and $4.6 million related to the write-down of the CVR and the impairment of the Company's shares of ARO stock, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	ARO filed for insolvency on June 9, 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	The write-down related to the CVR was based upon the Company's assessment of the value that it expects to recover from the insolvency proceedings.
891103_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	The impairment charge related to the ARO stock was based on the Company's conclusion that the decline in ARO's stock price was other-than-temporary due, in part, to ARO's insolvency filing.
891103_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Gain on sales of long-term investments in 2008 represents a gain of $352.0 million on the sale of the Company's investment in Jupiter Shop and a gain of $29.1 million associated with the sale of the Company's preferred investment in Points International, Ltd. ("Points").
891103_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	On December 8, 2008 the Company sold its 30% equity stake in Jupiter Shop for $493.3 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Other expense in 2008 of $234.6 million is primarily due to the impairment charges of $166.7 million and $13.3 million related to the Company's investment in ARO, and certain other investments, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	The impairment charge resulted from the Company's conclusion that the decline in the value of the investment in ARO was other-than-temporary due to the significant decline in, and the Company's assessment of the near-to-medium term prospects for a recovery of, the ARO stock price.
891103_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	Other expense in 2008 also reflects a $63.2 million loss on the extinguishment of $734.2 million of the Senior Notes.
891103_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	In 2010, the Company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $32.1 million, which represents an effective tax rate of 141%.
891103_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The 2010 tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to non-deductible impairment charges related to goodwill and intangible assets, interest on tax contingencies, a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset created by the impairment charge for our investment in HealthCentral and state taxes, partially offset by foreign tax credits, foreign income taxed at lower rates, and the reversal of a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to an unconsolidated affiliate.
891103_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	In 2009, the Company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $9.5 million, despite losses from continuing operations.
891103_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	The tax provision is primarily due to non-deductible impairment charges related to IAC Search Media.
891103_11_ITEM7_P48_S4	In 2008, the Company recorded an income tax benefit for continuing operations of $30.7 million, despite income from continuing operations.
891103_11_ITEM7_P48_S5	The tax benefit is due to a net reduction in deferred tax liabilities caused by the Spin-Off, foreign tax credits generated by the sale of Jupiter Shop, foreign income taxed at lower rates, and state tax benefits, partially offset by changes in tax reserves, non-deductible costs related to the Spin-Off, and an increase in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to other-than-temporary losses related to certain investments.
891103_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $389.9 million and $394.3 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Unrecognized tax benefits for December 31, 2010 decreased by $4.4 million due principally to a net decrease in deductible temporary differences and decreases in reserves established in prior years for statute lapses, partially offset by an increase in reserves related to research credits.
891103_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 is a $9.1 million expense and a $7.0 million expense, net of related deferred taxes of $5.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has accrued $97.7 million and $68.7 million, respectively, for the payment of interest.
891103_11_ITEM7_P50_S2	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has accrued $5.0 million for penalties.
891103_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax.
891103_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions.
891103_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company's tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2001 through 2006.
891103_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	The statute of limitations for these years has currently been extended to December 31, 2011, but is expected to be extended further.
891103_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Various state, local and foreign jurisdictions are currently under examination, the most significant of which are California, New York and New York City for various tax years beginning with December 31, 2003.
891103_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Income taxes payable include reserves considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns.
891103_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Differences between the reserves for tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $41.3 million within twelve months of the current reporting date primarily due to expirations of statutes of limitation, the reversal of deductible temporary differences that will primarily result in a corresponding decrease in net deferred tax assets, the reversal of state tax reserves based upon the receipt of favorable income tax rulings, and settlements.
891103_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	Included in this amount is $4.9 million which will reverse in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of the receipt of a favorable state income tax ruling.
891103_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	An estimate of other changes in unrecognized tax benefits, while potentially significant, cannot be made.
891103_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations include InstantAction, which ceased operations during the fourth quarter of 2010, Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions through December 1, 2010, HSNi, ILG, Ticketmaster and Tree.com through August 20, 2008, and EPI through May 30, 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company recognized after-tax gains of $140.8 million on the tax-free exchange of Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions in 2010 and $22.3 million on the sale of EPI in 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	The 2010 amount is primarily due to losses of InstantAction, which includes a pre-tax impairment charge related to goodwill of $31.6 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	The 2009 amount is principally due to losses of InstantAction and tax return to provision adjustments related to the spun-off entities and interest on tax contingencies.
891103_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The 2008 amount is principally due to the losses of HSNi, Tree.com and EPI, which include pre-tax impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $221.5 million and $78.5 million, respectively, for HSNi and $132.5 million and $33.4 million, respectively, for Tree.com.
891103_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	The losses from HSNi, Tree.com and EPI were partially offset by income of Ticketmaster and ILG.
891103_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	In addition to the discussion of consolidated results above, the following is a discussion of the results of each segment.
891103_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our Search segment consists of toolbars that we develop, market and distribute and destination search and other websites, including Ask.com and Dictionary.com, through which we primarily provide search, reference and content services, as well as CityGrid Media, a media company that operates CityGrid, a leading local content and advertising network through which local business listings, advertising and content are distributed to publishers across web and mobile platforms.
891103_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Revenue increased 23% to $837.1 million, reflecting growth in queries from distributed and proprietary toolbars and destination websites.
891103_11_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase in queries from distributed toolbars is attributable to new partners and growth from existing partners, while the increase from proprietary toolbars and destination websites was driven by increased traffic acquisition efforts and enhancements within our proprietary toolbar business.
891103_11_ITEM7_P61_S2	Revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in revenue per query, as distributed toolbar queries generally monetize at lower rates.
891103_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	CityGrid Media revenue increased primarily due to the contribution from new resellers and growth from existing resellers.
891103_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization increased 37% to $125.5 million, primarily due to the higher revenue noted above and a decrease of $13.4 million in selling and marketing expense, partially offset by increases of $108.5 million in traffic acquisition costs and $5.5 million in general and administrative expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	The decrease in selling and marketing expense is primarily due to a decrease of $7.2 million in advertising and promotional expenditures, as the prior year included expenditures associated with the NASCAR partnership and an ad campaign to rebrand the Ask Jeeves UK website, as well as a decrease in compensation and other employee-related costs at CityGrid Media, due in part, to a decrease in average headcount.
891103_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	The increase in traffic acquisition costs is primarily due to an increase in revenue.
891103_11_ITEM7_P63_S3	As a percentage of revenue, traffic acquisition costs increased over the prior year due to an increase in the proportion of revenue from distributed toolbars and other arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to our websites, as well as a shift in partner mix to partners carrying higher traffic acquisition costs.
891103_11_ITEM7_P63_S4	The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs associated with growth in our toolbar business and employee termination costs associated with the Ask.com restructuring, partially offset by a decrease in litigation related expenses.
891103_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Operating income increased $1.1 billion to $112.9 million, primarily due to the inclusion in the prior year of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $1.045 billion related to IAC Search Media described below.
891103_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	In 2010 the Company identified and recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $11.0 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	The charge is due to lower future revenue projections associated with a trade name and trademark based largely upon the impact of 2010's full year results.
891103_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	Further contributing to the increase in operating income in the current year is an increase in Operating Income Before Amortization described above and decreases of $18.3 million in amortization of intangibles, exclusive of the impairment charges, and $6.5 million in amortization of non-cash marketing.
891103_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Revenue declined 9% to $681.8 million, primarily due to a sharp decline in network revenue, resulting from the discontinuation of relationships with certain partners that took place during 2008 in conjunction with the renewed Google agreement.
891103_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	anniversaried during the second quarter of 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Revenue declines also reflect a decrease in revenue per query at Ask.com resulting from fewer clicks per visit as users find what they are searching for sooner due to the site's improved user experience resulting from its relaunch in October 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	Offsetting these decreases was the continued growth in partners and queries at the toolbar business and the favorable impact to revenue related to the acquisition of Lexico, which includes Dictionary.com and Thesaurus.com, on July 3, 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	CityGrid Media's revenue decline reflected a difficult display advertising environment and transitional issues related to the relaunch of the site and the integration of a new ad serving platform.
891103_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization decreased 37% to $91.6 million, primarily due to the lower revenue noted above and an increase of $4.4 million in selling and marketing expense, partially offset by decreases of $7.9 million in traffic acquisition costs and $5.6 million in product development expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase in selling and marketing expense is primarily due to an increase of $4.1 million in advertising and promotional expenditures, including those associated with the NASCAR partnership and an ad campaign to rebrand the Ask Jeeves UK website.
891103_11_ITEM7_P67_S2	Overall traffic acquisition costs during the period decreased as a direct result of a sharp decline in network revenue at IAC Search Media; however, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue increased.
891103_11_ITEM7_P67_S3	The decrease in product development expense is primarily due to a decrease of $4.9 million in compensation and other employee-related costs due, in part, to an approximate 7% reduction in average headcount at IAC Search Media and an increase in costs being capitalized in 2009 related to the development and enhancement of IAC Search Media's product offerings and related technology.
891103_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	Operating income decreased $1.1 billion to a loss of $980.2 million, primarily due to impairment charges related to the write-down of goodwill and intangible assets of IAC Search Media of $916.9 million and $128.3 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The impairment charges reflected lower projections for revenue and profits at IAC Search Media in future years that reflected the Company's consideration of industry growth rates, competitive dynamics and IAC Search Media's operating strategies and the impact of these factors on the fair value of IAC Search Media and its goodwill and intangible assets.
891103_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	In 2008 the Company identified and recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $9.2 million related to the decline in revenue and profitability at IAC Search Media's Excite, iWon and MyWay portals businesses.
891103_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Further contributing to the decrease in operating income in the current year is the decrease in Operating Income Before Amortization described above and increases of $1.6 million in amortization of non-cash marketing and $0.6 million in non-cash compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease of $5.2 million in amortization of intangibles, exclusive of the impairment charges described above.
891103_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	Revenue increased 17% to $400.7 million, reflecting solid growth in the domestic business, including the combined contribution from People Media, acquired July 13, 2009, and Singlesnet, acquired March 2, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	Revenue in the current year also increased due to a venture with Meetic in Latin America, which was formed on March 10, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	These increases in revenue were partially offset by the effects of the sale of Match Europe to Meetic on June 5, 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	Excluding the results of People Media from both the current and prior year, Match Europe from the prior year and Singlesnet and the Latin America venture from the current year, revenue grew 11%.
891103_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization increased 30% to $122.1 million primarily due to the increase in revenue noted above, partially offset by increases of $15.1 million in selling and marketing expense, $10.3 million in cost of revenue and $3.3 million in product development expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increases in these expenses reflect the acquisitions of People Media and Singlesnet and the formation of the Latin America venture, partially offset by the sale of Match Europe.
891103_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	marketing expense is further impacted by an increase in advertising and promotional expenditures due to a new advertising agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2010 with Yahoo.
891103_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Operating income increased 36% to $115.4 million, primarily due to the increase in Operating Income Before Amortization described above.
891103_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Operating income also includes the impact in 2009 of $4.4 million in amortization of non-cash marketing, partially offset by an increase in 2010 of $1.9 million in amortization of intangibles, relating primarily to the acquisition of Singlesnet and the formation of the Latin America venture.
891103_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Revenue declined 6% to $342.6 million, reflecting the sale of Match Europe to Meetic on June 5, 2009, partially offset by the contribution from People Media, acquired July 13, 2009, and solid growth in the U.S. business.
891103_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	Excluding the results of Match Europe from 2009 and 2008 and People Media from 2009, revenue grew 6%.
891103_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization increased 3% to $94.1 million despite the decrease in revenue noted above, primarily due to decreases of $20.7 million in cost of revenue and $10.2 million in selling and marketing expense, partially offset by an increase of $3.2 million in general and administrative expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P75_S1	The decrease in both cost of revenue and selling and marketing expense is primarily due to the sale of Match Europe.
891103_11_ITEM7_P75_S2	Cost of revenue and selling and marketing expense also decreased due to more favorable economic terms under agreements with certain distribution partners and an increase in advertising and promotional expenditures associated with online marketing, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P75_S3	The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to $3.2 million of professional fees related to the sale of Match Europe.
891103_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Operating income increased 12% to $84.7 million in 2009, primarily due to the increase in Operating Income Before Amortization described above and a decrease of $10.7 million in amortization of non-cash marketing, partially offset by an increase of $4.3 million in amortization of intangibles, relating primarily to the acquisition of People Media.
891103_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	Revenue increased 16% to $181.4 million, benefiting from a 14% increase in service requests and a 19% increase in accepted service requests domestically and from growth at ServiceMagic International, partially offset by lower average lead acceptance fees.
891103_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	The increase in service requests was driven primarily by increased online and offline marketing efforts.
891103_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	The increase in accepted service requests was driven, in part, by a 22% increase in service providers.
891103_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	A service request can be transmitted to more than one service provider and is deemed accepted upon transmission.
891103_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization decreased 15% to $18.2 million despite the increase in revenue described above, primarily due to increases of $21.0 million in selling and marketing expense and $5.6 million in general and administrative expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The increase in selling and marketing expense is primarily driven by increases of $14.0 million and $7.0 million in marketing and compensation and other employee-related costs, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	The increase in compensation and other employee-related costs is due, in part, to the expansion of its sales force.
891103_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs driven by growth in headcount related to ServiceMagic International.
891103_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	Operating Income Before Amortization reflects the reversal in 2010 of a $2.5 million provision for contingent consideration related to the 2009 acquisition of Market Hardware, that will not be earned.
891103_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Operating income increased 23% to $16.4 million, despite the decrease in Operating Income Before Amortization described above primarily due to the inclusion in the prior year of $5.0 million in non-cash marketing and a decrease of $1.0 million in amortization of intangibles.
891103_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Revenue grew 26% to $155.8 million, benefiting from a 20% increase in domestic service requests to a growing and more active service provider network and a shift in mix to higher value service requests driven, in part, by increased marketing efforts.
891103_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	During 2009, ServiceMagic experienced a 25% increase in domestic accepted service requests.
891103_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	Revenue also benefited from the combined contribution from ServiceMagic International, acquired October 29, 2008, and Market Hardware, acquired January 23, 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P81_S3	Excluding the results of these acquisitions, revenue grew 19%.
891103_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization decreased 19% to $21.3 million, despite the increase in revenue noted above, reflecting increases of $25.1 million in selling and marketing expense and $9.1 million in general and administrative expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	The increase in selling and marketing expense is primarily driven by an increase in advertising and promotional expenditures associated with online marketing.
891103_11_ITEM7_P82_S2	The growth in service requests during the year from paid channels outpaced the growth in free requests as a result of the increase in online marketing.
891103_11_ITEM7_P82_S3	Also contributing to the increase in selling and marketing expense is an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs, due in part, to the expansion of its sales force.
891103_11_ITEM7_P82_S4	The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to increases of $4.6 million and $1.8 million in compensation and other employee-related costs related to acquisitions and bad debt expense, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Operating income decreased 44% to $13.4 million, primarily due to the decrease in Operating Income Before Amortization described above, $5.0 million in amortization of non-cash marketing in 2009 and an increase of $1.2 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by a decrease of $0.6 million in non-cash compensation expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Revenue increased 30% to $219.9 million reflecting the contribution from Notional and Electus, which were not in the full prior year period, and growth at Pronto, Shoebuy, CollegeHumor and Vimeo.
891103_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	Also impacting revenue is the inclusion in the current year of revenue associated with profit participations related to our interests in Reveille.
891103_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization loss decreased by $7.7 million to a loss of $12.0 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P85_S1	Losses decreased due primarily to $10.1 million in cost savings related to certain businesses that have been sold or shutdown and $2.9 million in profit participations related to our interests in Reveille noted above, partially offset by Electus, which is not in the full prior year period, and increased operating expenses associated with The Daily Beast.
891103_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Operating loss increased by $25.5 million to $47.5 million despite the decrease in Operating Income Before Amortization loss described above, primarily due to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges related to Shoebuy of $28.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	Also contributing to the increase in operating loss is an increase of $0.6 million in amortization of intangibles, exclusive of the impairment charge noted above.
891103_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Revenue declined 7% to $168.8 million primarily reflecting the absence of revenue from ReserveAmerica in the current year period following its sale on January 31, 2009, partially offset by growth at Shoebuy and Connected Ventures.
891103_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization loss decreased by $5.6 million to a loss of $19.7 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	Losses decreased due primarily to cost savings related to the shutdown or sale of certain businesses of $7.7 million, partially offset by increased operating expenses associated with The Daily Beast.
891103_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Operating loss decreased by $22.1 million to $22.1 million primarily due to the decreased Operating Income Before Amortization loss described above and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $11.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively, in 2008 related to Connected Ventures.
891103_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	Also contributing to the decrease in operating loss are decreases in amortization of intangibles, exclusive of the impairment charge noted above, and non-cash compensation expense of $2.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization loss decreased by $1.3 million to a loss of $64.2 million primarily due to lower depreciation and salary expense, partially offset by $5.3 million in transaction expenses in the current year related to the Liberty Exchange.
891103_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Operating loss increased $13.6 million to $147.3 million despite the decrease in Operating Income Before Amortization loss due to an increase of $14.9 million in non-cash compensation expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The increase in non-cash compensation expense is primarily related to an increase in expense attributable to awards granted subsequent to the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by awards having become fully vested.
891103_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization loss decreased by $55.5 million to a loss of $65.5 million primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of $42.0 million in expenses related to the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	The current year also benefited from lower compensation and other employee-related costs.
891103_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Operating loss decreased $71.9 million to a loss of $133.7 million reflecting the decrease in Operating Income Before Amortization loss described above and a decrease of $16.4 million in non-cash compensation expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	The decrease in non-cash compensation expense reflects the acceleration and modification of certain equity awards associated with the Spin-Off in 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $742.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $564.0 million of marketable securities and $95.8 million in long-term debt.
891103_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	Long-term debt consists of $80.0 million in Liberty Bonds due September 1, 2035 and $15.8 million in Senior Notes.
891103_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	During 2010 and 2009, the Company purchased 23.1 million and 32.1 million shares of IAC common stock for aggregate consideration, on a trade date basis, of $530.9 million and $554.2 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	In addition on December 1, 2010, the Company completed the tax-free exchange of Evite, Gifts.com, IAC Advertising Solutions and $217.9 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty's equity stake in IAC, representing 8.5 million shares of Class B common stock and 4.3 million shares of IAC common stock.
891103_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	On February 26, 2010, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 20 million shares of IAC common stock.
891103_11_ITEM7_P95_S3	At January 28, 2011, IAC had approximately 7.2 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
891103_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
891103_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations was $340.7 million and $348.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	The decrease of $7.8 million in net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations is primarily due to the payment of the 2009 cash bonuses in 2010, whereas the 2008 cash bonuses were paid in the fourth quarter of 2008, and lower net income tax refunds in 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2010 of $118.1 million includes $74.8 million related to the net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable debt securities, capital expenditures of $39.8 million and acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $17.3 million, partially offset by the dividend received from Meetic of $11.4 million and proceeds of $5.3 million from the sale of the Company's remaining shares of OpenTable.

891103_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2010 of $717.2 million includes the purchase of treasury stock of $539.6 million and $217.9 million in cash as part of the Liberty Exchange, partially offset by proceeds related to the issuance of common stock, net of withholding taxes, of $25.9 million and the excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $14.3 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2009 of $405.8 million includes the purchase of treasury stock of $545.5 million and the settlement of vested stock-based awards denominated in a subsidiary's equity of $14.3 million, partially offset by the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock, net of withholding taxes, of $151.9 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	Included in the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock are aggregate proceeds of $150.9 million from the exercise of warrants to acquire 11.5 million shares of IAC common stock that were due to expire on February 4, 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P99_S3	The strike price of the warrants was $13.09 per share.
891103_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	IAC anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations.
891103_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	The Company may make a number of acquisitions which could result in the reduction of its cash and/or marketable securities balance or the incurrence of debt.
891103_11_ITEM7_P100_S2	IAC expects that 2011 capital expenditures will be slightly less than 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P100_S3	IAC believes that its cash on hand along with its anticipated operating cash flows in 2011 and its access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, capital, investing and other commitments and contingencies for the foreseeable future.
891103_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company has recorded $487.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits which includes accrued interest of $97.7 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P101_S1	This amount includes $310.0 million for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that could result in future net cash payments to taxing authorities.
891103_11_ITEM7_P101_S2	The Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the expected period of cash settlement of these items.
891103_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	(b) Represents contractual amounts due, including interest.
891103_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	(c) The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments, which commitments are reducible or terminable such that these commitments can never exceed associated revenue by a meaningful amount.
891103_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	Purchase obligations also include minimum payments due under telecommunication contracts related to data transmission lines.
891103_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	* Commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events, such as under lines of credit extended.
891103_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Other than the items described above, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	IAC reports Operating Income Before Amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_11_ITEM7_P105_S3	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_11_ITEM7_P105_S4	, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_11_ITEM7_P105_S5	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure which we discuss below.
891103_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization of non-cash marketing, (3) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (4) goodwill impairment, (5) pro forma adjustments for significant acquisitions, and (6) one-time items.
891103_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	We believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation, non-cash marketing, and acquisition-related accounting.
891103_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	We will only present Operating Income Before Amortization on a pro forma basis if we view a particular transaction as significant in size or transformational in nature.
891103_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	For the periods presented in this report, there are no transactions that we have included on a pro forma basis.
891103_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization is presented before one-time items, if applicable.
891103_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	These items are truly one-time in nature and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
891103_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	For the periods presented in this report, there are no one-time items.
891103_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Non-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock.
891103_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which, for stock options and restricted stock units, are included on a treasury method basis.
891103_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Amortization of non-cash marketing consists of non-cash advertising credits secured from Universal Television as part of the transaction pursuant to which VUE was created, and the subsequent transaction by which IAC sold its partnership interests in VUE (collectively referred to as "NBC Universal Advertising").
891103_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	various NBC Universal network and cable channels without any cash cost.
891103_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	There are no NBC Universal Advertising credits available as all credits were used prior to December 31, 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	The NBC Universal Advertising is excluded from Operating Income Before Amortization because it is non-cash and generally is incremental to the advertising the Company otherwise secures as a result of its ordinary cost/benefit marketing planning process.
891103_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	Accordingly, the Company's aggregate level of advertising, and the increased concentration of that advertising on NBC Universal network and cable channels, does not reflect what our advertising effort would otherwise be without these credits.
891103_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	As a result, management believes that treating the NBC Universal Advertising as an expense does not appropriately reflect its true cost/benefit relationship, nor does it best reflect the Company's long-term level of advertising expenditures.
891103_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	Nonetheless, while the benefits directly attributable to television advertising are always difficult to determine, and especially so with respect to the NBC Universal Advertising due to its incrementality and heavy concentration, it is likely that the Company does derive benefits from it, though management believes such benefits are generally less than those received through its regular advertising for the reasons stated above.
891103_11_ITEM7_P114_S4	Operating Income Before Amortization therefore has the limitation of including those benefits while excluding the associated expense.
891103_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Amortization of intangibles (including impairment of intangibles, if applicable) and goodwill impairment (if applicable) are non-cash expenses relating to acquisitions.
891103_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer lists, technology and supplier agreements, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	While it is likely that we will have intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	For a reconciliation of Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) by business and to net earnings (loss) attributable to IAC shareholders in total for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
891103_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
891103_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are tested annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P123_S1	The annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2010 related to the Shoebuy and IAC Search Media reporting units and in 2009 related to the IAC Search Media reporting unit.
891103_11_ITEM7_P123_S2	These impairment charges are more fully described above in "Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008".
891103_11_ITEM7_P123_S3	The value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $989.5 million and $237.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process.
891103_11_ITEM7_P124_S1	The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_11_ITEM7_P124_S2	In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis.
891103_11_ITEM7_P124_S3	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 20% in both 2010 and 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S4	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S5	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S6	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S7	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
891103_11_ITEM7_P125_S8	In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid.
891103_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	The estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 20% in both 2010 and 2009, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 10% in both 2010 and 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	The Company has six reporting units with goodwill.
891103_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	Of these, IAC Search Media and Shoebuy have fair values closest to their carrying values.
891103_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	The amount of goodwill of each of these reporting units is $534.0 million and $21.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P132_S3	To illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges related to potential future changes in estimated fair values, had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 10% as of October 1, 2010, their estimated fair values would exceed their carrying values.
891103_11_ITEM7_P132_S4	Had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 20% as of October 1, 2010, the carrying values of IAC Search Media and Shoebuy would have exceeded their fair values by approximately $9 million and $3 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P132_S5	If operating results of these businesses vary significantly from anticipated results, future, and in the case of IAC Search Media, potentially material, impairments of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets could occur.
891103_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	Any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	The primary driver in the DCF valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability.
891103_11_ITEM7_P134_S1	Generally, the Company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	This assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S3	During 2010, the Company did not record any impairment charges related to definite-lived intangible assets.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S4	During 2009, the Company recorded an impairment charge related to the definite-lived intangible assets of IAC Search Media.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S5	The definite-lived intangible asset impairment charge primarily related to certain technology and advertiser relationships, the carrying values of which were no longer considered recoverable based upon an assessment of future cash flows related to these assets.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S6	Accordingly, these assets were written down to fair value in 2009.
891103_11_ITEM7_P136_S7	The value of long-lived assets that is subject to assessment for impairment is $276.0 million at December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Company invests in certain marketable securities, which consist primarily of short-to-intermediate-term debt securities issued by the U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, states of the U.S. and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	The unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of a security sold or the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S4	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investment in marketable securities to decline.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S5	During 2010, the Company did not consider any of its marketable securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S6	During 2009, the Company sold its 5.5 million shares of ARO stock, resulting in aggregate losses of $12.3 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P138_S7	Prior to the sale of its last 1.1 million shares of ARO stock, the Company concluded that the decline in the stock price of these remaining shares was other-than-temporary, due in part, to ARO's insolvency filing on June 9, 2009, and recorded impairment charges totaling $4.6 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	We make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when it is assessed that all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected.
891103_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.
891103_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
891103_11_ITEM7_P140_S2	The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments.
891103_11_ITEM7_P140_S3	The amount of these reserves are based, in part, on historical experience.
891103_11_ITEM7_P140_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is $8.8 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	Estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, and reflect management's assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization.
891103_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the balance of deferred tax assets, net, is $146.2 million.
891103_11_ITEM7_P141_S2	Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the IRS, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process.
891103_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	As disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2010, 2009 and 2008 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 2.4%, 2.1% and 2.6%, respectively, a dividend yield of zero and volatility factors of 30%, 59% and 47%, respectively, based on the historical stock price volatilities of IAC for 2010 and peer companies operating in the same industry sector as IAC for 2009 and 2008 and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 5.6 years, 4.9 years and 4.4 years, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P146_S1	The historical stock price volatilities in 2009 and 2008 of peer companies was used due to the lack of sufficient historical IAC stock price volatilities subsequent to the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	For stock options, including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date (or acquisition date, if applicable) at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term.
891103_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	The impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor, and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $1.5 million, $7.7 million, and $5.0 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	The Company also issues restricted stock units and performance stock units.
891103_11_ITEM7_P148_S1	For restricted stock units issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation expense over the vesting term.
891103_11_ITEM7_P148_S2	For performance stock units issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investment portfolio and long-term debt.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which consist primarily of money market instruments and short-to-intermediate-term debt securities issued by the U.S. government, U.S. governmental agencies, states of the U.S. and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2010, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the debt investment securities by $3.2 million.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Conversely, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately $742.1 million is invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company's outstanding debt approximated $95.8 million, all of which pays interest at fixed rates.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $10.5 million.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company has two investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	One of these investments is the Company's investment in Meetic, which is accounted for using the equity method.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The other investment is an available-for-sale marketable equity security.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The investment in Meetic is included in "Long-term investments" and the available-for-sale marketable equity security is included in "Marketable securities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P5_S4	The available-for-sale marketable equity security is reported at fair value based on its quoted market price with any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, included as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive income" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market, among other factors.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	During 2010, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its available-for-sale marketable equity security.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	It is not customary for the Company to make significant investments in equity securities as part of its marketable securities investment strategy.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	IAC holds approximately 6.1 million shares of common stock (a 27% stake) in Meetic, an online dating company based in France.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Meetic's shares are listed on the Euronext stock exchange (EPA: MEET).
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As a result, IAC is exposed to changes in Meetic's stock price.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The investment in Meetic is accounted for using the equity method and the Company records its share of the results of Meetic and related amortization of intangibles on a one-quarter lag within "Equity in (losses) income of unconsolidated affiliates" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S4	The carrying value of the Meetic investment is $130.0 million at December 31, 2010, which is lower than the carrying value of $156.5 million at December 31, 2009, primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a dividend of $11.4 million.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S5	The fair value of the Meetic investment, based on its quoted market price, is $130.0 million at December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S6	Because our investment in Meetic is accounted for using the equity method, it is not reported at fair value.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P8_S7	In the event the fair value of Meetic were to decline below its carrying value, this decline would be only one factor in an assessment for other-than-temporary impairment.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the British Pound Sterling and Euro.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	However, the exposure is mitigated since the Company has generally reinvested profits from international operations in order to grow the businesses.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S3	As a percentage of total IAC revenue (which excludes revenue related to discontinued operations), international operations represented approximately 17%, 15% and 20% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S4	The statements of operations of the Company's international operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S5	To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenues and operating income.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S6	Similarly, the Company's revenue and operating income will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P9_S7	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the Company is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	These changes, if material, could cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the Company's earnings in 2010, 2009 and 2008.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P11_S1	As currency exchange rates change, translation of the income statements of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P11_S2	Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency translation risks because cash flows from international operations were generally reinvested locally.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P11_S3	However, the Company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency translation risks.
891103_11_ITEM7A_P11_S4	The Company's objective in managing its foreign currency risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on its earnings, cash flows and financial position.
891103_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of IAC/InterActiveCorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a).
891103_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
891103_11_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
891103_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
891103_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
891103_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
891103_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
891103_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
891103_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of IAC/InterActiveCorp and subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
891103_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), IAC/InterActiveCorp's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

891103_11_ITEM8_P14_S2	Through Match, we also own a 27% stake in Meetic S.A. ("Meetic"), a European online dating company based in France.
891103_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	ServiceMagic is a leading online marketplace in the United States that connects consumers, by way of patented proprietary technologies, with home and other local service professionals, all of which are pre-screened and the majority of which are customer-rated.

891103_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	On December 1, 2010, IAC exchanged (on a tax-free basis) the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and $217.9 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation's ("Liberty") equity stake in IAC (the "Liberty Exchange").
891103_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	See Note 11 for additional information related to this exchange.
891103_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2010, InstantAction ceased operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Evite, Gifts.com and InstantAction were previously reported in IAC's Media Other segment.
891103_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	the year ended December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	On August 20, 2008, IAC completed the Spin-Off of HSN, Inc. ("HSNi"), Interval Leisure Group, Inc. ("ILG"), Ticketmaster Entertainment, Inc. ("Ticketmaster") and Tree.com, Inc. ("Tree.com") (collectively, the "Spincos") into separate independent publicly traded companies (collectively, the "Spin-Off").
891103_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	During 2008, IAC also sold Entertainment Publications, Inc. ("EPI").
891103_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	See Note 15 for additional information related to discontinued operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The notes accompanying these consolidated financial statements reflect our continuing operations and, unless otherwise noted, exclude information related to the discontinued operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, all entities that are wholly-owned by the Company and all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest, whether through voting interests or variable interests.
891103_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Company's consolidated financial statements include one variable interest entity, in which the Company has a controlling financial interest through voting rights and is also the primary beneficiary.
891103_11_ITEM8_P22_S2	Intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
891103_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Investments in entities in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial matters of the investee, but does not own a controlling financial interest, are accounted for using the equity method.
891103_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	Investments in entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial matters of the investee are accounted for using the cost method.
891103_11_ITEM8_P23_S2	The Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_11_ITEM8_P23_S3	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition and the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash and the investee company's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee company's existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.
891103_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
891103_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
891103_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	They also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period.

891103_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	To illustrate the magnitude of potential impairment charges related to potential future changes in estimated fair values, had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 10% as of October 1, 2010, their estimated fair values would exceed their carrying values.
891103_11_ITEM8_P50_S4	Had the estimated fair values of each of these reporting units been hypothetically lower by 20% as of October 1, 2010, the carrying values of IAC Search Media and Shoebuy would have exceeded their fair values by approximately $9 million and $3 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P50_S5	If operating results of these businesses vary significantly from anticipated results, future, and in the case of IAC Search Media, potentially material, impairments of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets could occur.

891103_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	Level 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	The fair value of the Company's level 2 financial assets is primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.
891103_11_ITEM8_P54_S3	Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case a weighted average market price is used.
891103_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	See Note 8 for a discussion of assets measured at fair value using level 3 inputs.
891103_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity and cost method investments, are measured at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.

891103_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	These access points are generally in the form of downloadable search toolbars associated with the Company's search businesses.
891103_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	These fees are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent the Company can reasonably estimate a probable future economic benefit and the period over which such benefit will be realized (generally 18 months).
891103_11_ITEM8_P59_S3	Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred.
891103_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Amortization of non-cash marketing consists of non-cash advertising credits secured from Universal Television as part of the transaction pursuant to which Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP ("VUE") was created, and the subsequent transaction by which IAC sold its partnership interests in VUE (collectively referred to as the "NBC Universal Advertising").

891103_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
891103_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_11_ITEM8_P64_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	Basic earnings per share ("Basic EPS") is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
891103_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	Diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
891103_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	The financial position and operating results of substantially all foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency.

891103_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Company is party to fair value put and call arrangements with respect to these interests.
891103_11_ITEM8_P70_S2	These put and call arrangements allow management of these businesses to require the Company to purchase their interests or allow the Company to acquire such interests at fair value, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P70_S3	These put and call arrangements become exercisable by the Company and the counter-party at various dates over the next six years.
891103_11_ITEM8_P70_S4	During 2010 and 2009, none of these arrangements became exercisable.
891103_11_ITEM8_P70_S5	These put arrangements are exercisable by the counter-party outside the control of the Company.
891103_11_ITEM8_P70_S6	Accordingly, to the extent that the fair value of these interests exceeds the value determined by normal noncontrolling interest accounting, the value of such interests is adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
891103_11_ITEM8_P70_S7	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded adjustments of $(2.1) million and $1.0 million, respectively, to (reduce) increase these interests to fair value.

891103_11_ITEM8_P71_S2	Since the redemption of the noncontrolling interests is outside the control of the Company, these interests are included in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, outside of shareholders' equity.
891103_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	A significant portion of the Company's revenue is derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
891103_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying behavior or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.
891103_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	A significant majority of the Company's online advertising is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with Google, which expires on December 31, 2012.
891103_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	supply agreement by Google or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

891103_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	During 2010, the Company's valuation allowance increased by $4.9 million.
891103_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	The valuation allowance increase primarily relates to net unbenefited unrealized losses on equity investments and foreign NOLs, partially offset by a write-off of previously unbenefited deferred tax assets for state capital loss carryforwards.
891103_11_ITEM8_P89_S2	At December 31, 2010, the Company had a valuation allowance of $40.3 million related to the portion of tax loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.

891103_11_ITEM8_P93_S2	The remaining balance of $475.7 million is reflected in "non-current income taxes payable".
891103_11_ITEM8_P93_S3	Unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased by $4.4 million due principally to a net decrease in deductible temporary differences and decreases in reserves established in prior years for statute lapses, partially offset by an increase in reserves related to research credits.
891103_11_ITEM8_P93_S4	Included in unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 is $101.7 million for tax positions which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
891103_11_ITEM8_P93_S5	If unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 are subsequently recognized, $103.1 million and $206.9 million, net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.

891103_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
891103_11_ITEM8_P94_S1	Included in income tax expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is a $9.1 million, $8.3 million and $8.4 million expense, respectively, net of related deferred taxes of $5.8 million, $5.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.

891103_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company's tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2001 through 2006.
891103_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	The statute of limitations for these years has currently been extended to December 31, 2011, but is expected to be extended further.

891103_11_ITEM8_P98_S2	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	Differences between the reserves for tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $41.3 million within twelve months of the current reporting date primarily due to expirations of statutes of limitation, the reversal of deductible temporary differences that will primarily result in a corresponding decrease in net deferred tax assets, the reversal of state tax reserves based upon the receipt of favorable income tax rulings, and settlements.
891103_11_ITEM8_P99_S2	Included in this amount is $4.9 million which will reverse in the first quarter of 2011 as a result of the receipt of a favorable state income tax ruling.
891103_11_ITEM8_P99_S3	An estimate of other changes in unrecognized tax benefits, while potentially significant, cannot be made.
891103_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	The Company also reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a definite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable.

891103_11_ITEM8_P101_S1	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at Shoebuy relates to trade names and trademarks.
891103_11_ITEM8_P101_S2	The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges at Shoebuy reflect expectations of lower revenue and profit performance in future years due to Shoebuy's 2010 fourth quarter revenue and profit performance, which is its seasonally strongest quarter.
891103_11_ITEM8_P101_S3	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at IAC Search Media is primarily due to lower future revenue projections associated with a trade name and trademark based largely upon the impact of 2010's full year results.
891103_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	In connection with its annual assessment and its review of definite-lived intangible assets in 2009, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges at the Search segment related to the write-down of the goodwill and indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets of IAC Search Media of $916.9 million, $104.1 million and $24.2 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges reflected lower projections for revenue and profits at IAC Search Media in future years that reflected the Company's consideration of industry growth rates, competitive dynamics and IAC Search Media's operating strategies and the impact of these factors on the fair value of IAC Search Media and its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

891103_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	In connection with its annual assessment in 2008, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges related to the write-down of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of Connected Ventures, which is included in the Media Other segment, of $11.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively, and the indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Search segment of $9.2 million.
891103_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	The impairment at Connected Ventures resulted from the Company's assessment of its future profitability.
891103_11_ITEM8_P103_S2	The impairment at the Search segment primarily resulted from the decline in revenue and profitability at IAC Search Media's Excite, iWon and MyWay portals businesses.
891103_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow ("DCF") analyses, and typically corroborates the concluded fair value using a market based valuation approach.
891103_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_11_ITEM8_P105_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_11_ITEM8_P105_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.

891103_11_ITEM8_P131_S1	The decline in value was determined to be other-than-temporary due to HealthCentral's continued losses and negative operating cash flows, which are due, in part, to macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_11_ITEM8_P131_S2	The valuation of our investment in HealthCentral reflects the Company's assessment of these factors.
891103_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	revenue approach in the context of a different valuation environment than that which prevailed when our initial investment was made.

891103_11_ITEM8_P135_S4	The decline in value was determined to be other-than-temporary due to the equity method investee's operating losses, negative operating cash flows and the resulting need for changes to the investee's existing business model.
891103_11_ITEM8_P135_S5	The resulting valuation of the investee also reflected the assessment of market conditions and the investee's ability to successfully restructure.

891103_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a $7.8 million impairment charge related to the write-down of its cost method investment in Zip Express Installation ("Zip").
891103_11_ITEM8_P141_S1	The impairment charge was determined to be other-than-temporary due to Zip's inability to achieve its 2010 cash flow forecast during its seasonally strongest fourth quarter and the Company's assessment that Zip would be unable to continue to operate without new outside financing.
891103_11_ITEM8_P141_S2	The impairment charge is included in "Other (expense) income, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a $7.1 million impairment charge related to the write-down of certain cost method investments to fair value.
891103_11_ITEM8_P142_S1	The decline in value was determined to be other other-than-temporary due to management's reassessment of the fair value of these investments due, in part, to operating results and valuations implied by capital transactions.
891103_11_ITEM8_P142_S2	The impairment charge is included in "Other (expense) income, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	See Note 8 for information regarding auction rate securities.
891103_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	The marketable equity security that was considered long-term at December 31, 2009 is now considered short-term and included in "Marketable securities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM8_P144_S1	The amortized cost basis of this long-term marketable equity security was $12.9 million at December 31, 2009, with a gross unrealized gain of $2.7 million included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_11_ITEM8_P144_S2	During 2008, the Company recorded a $4.8 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to the write-down of this marketable equity security due to the significant decline in and the duration of the decline in its stock price.
891103_11_ITEM8_P144_S3	This impairment charge is included in "Other (expense) income, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P144_S4	See Note 6 for additional information relating to this marketable equity security.

891103_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	(a) The loss associated with the derivative asset related to the ARO stock consists of a write-down of $58.1 million, described below, partially offset by foreign currency translation gains.
891103_11_ITEM8_P147_S1	This loss is unrealized and included in "Other (expense) income, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	Historically, the Company's auction rate securities ("ARS") had determinable market values arising from the auction process.
891103_11_ITEM8_P148_S1	However, these auctions began to fail in the third quarter of 2007.
891103_11_ITEM8_P148_S2	As a result of these failed auctions, the ARS no longer have readily determinable market values and are instead valued by discounting the estimated future cash flow streams of the securities over the lives of the securities.
891103_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	Credit spreads and other risk factors are also considered in establishing a fair value.
891103_11_ITEM8_P149_S1	At December 31, 2010, the ARS are rated either A+/WR or A/WR.
891103_11_ITEM8_P149_S2	The cost basis of these ARS is $15.0 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, with gross unrealized losses of $1.9 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P149_S3	Due to their high credit rating and because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider the ARS to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM8_P149_S4	The unrealized losses are included in "Accumulated other comprehensive income" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	The ARS mature in 2025 and 2035.
891103_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	The CVR was accounted for as a derivative asset and maintained at fair value relying on significant unobservable inputs including credit risk.
891103_11_ITEM8_P151_S1	During 2009, the Company wrote the value of the CVR down to zero.
891103_11_ITEM8_P151_S2	This reflected the increased credit risk due to ARO's insolvency filing and the Company's assessment of the value that it expects to recover.
891103_11_ITEM8_P151_S3	The charge resulting from this write-down totaled $58.1 million.
891103_11_ITEM8_P152_S0	The fair values of the financial instruments listed below have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
891103_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity.
891103_11_ITEM8_P153_S1	The fair value of notes receivable is based on discounting the expected future cash flow streams using yields of the underlying credit.
891103_11_ITEM8_P153_S2	The fair value of long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or indices for similar liabilities and taking into consideration other factors such as credit quality and maturity.
891103_11_ITEM8_P153_S3	The fair value of the guarantee, letters of credit and surety bond are based on the present value of the costs associated with maintaining these instruments over their expected term.
891103_11_ITEM8_P153_S4	See Note 2 for discussion of the fair value of marketable securities and the long-term marketable equity security and Note 8 for discussion of the fair value of the auction rate securities.

891103_11_ITEM8_P159_S2	Upon the conversion of shares of IAC Class B common stock into shares of IAC common stock, those shares of IAC Class B common stock will be retired and will not be subject to reissue.
891103_11_ITEM8_P159_S3	Shares of IAC common stock are not convertible into shares of IAC Class B common stock.
891103_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	Except as described herein, shares of IAC common stock and IAC Class B common stock are identical.
891103_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	The holders of shares of IAC common stock and the holders of shares of IAC Class B common stock are entitled to receive, share for share, such dividends as may be declared by IAC's Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefore.

891103_11_ITEM8_P165_S1	Any purchase by Liberty was allocated between IAC common stock and Class B common stock in the same proportion as the issuance or issuances giving rise to the preemptive right, except to the extent that Liberty opted to acquire shares of IAC common stock in lieu of shares of IAC Class B common stock.
891103_11_ITEM8_P165_S2	Liberty did not exercise its preemptive right in the third quarter of 2010 and was not entitled to exercise its preemptive right in 2009 as its ownership, at the time of notice, had exceeded the established cap.

891103_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to IAC shareholders.
891103_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	(a) Amounts include in 2010 the gain on the Liberty Exchange and in 2008 the gain on the sale of EPI.
891103_11_ITEM8_P173_S1	(b) For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had losses from continuing operations and as a result, no potentially dilutive securities were included in the denominator for computing dilutive earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_11_ITEM8_P173_S2	Accordingly, the weighted average basic shares outstanding were used to compute all earnings per share amounts.
891103_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	38.0 million shares, respectively, related to potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	(c) If the effect is dilutive, weighted average common shares outstanding include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants, vesting of RSUs and PSUs and the conversion of the Ask Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due June 1, 2008 (the "Convertible Notes").
891103_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 39.9 million shares related to potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	During the second quarter of 2008 all outstanding Convertible Notes were fully converted.
891103_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	IAC currently has two active plans under which awards have been granted, which cover stock options to acquire shares of IAC common stock, RSUs, PSUs and restricted stock, as well as provide for the future grant of these and other equity awards.
891103_11_ITEM8_P178_S1	These plans are: the IAC 2008 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") and the IAC 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan").
891103_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	Under the 2008 Plan, the Company was originally authorized to grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock and other equity based awards for up to 20.0 million shares of IAC common stock.
891103_11_ITEM8_P179_S1	Under the 2005 Plan, the Company was originally authorized to grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock and other equity based awards for up to 20.0 million shares of IAC common stock, adjusted to reflect IAC's one-for-two reverse stock split in August 2008.
891103_11_ITEM8_P179_S2	The active plans described above authorize the Company to grant awards to its employees, officers, directors and consultants.
891103_11_ITEM8_P179_S3	At December 31, 2010, there were 12.7 million shares available for grant under the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
891103_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	The plans described above have a stated term of ten years and provide that the exercise price of stock options granted will not be less than the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date.
891103_11_ITEM8_P180_S1	The plans do not specify grant dates or vesting schedules as those determinations have been delegated to the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of IAC's Board of Directors (the "Committee").
891103_11_ITEM8_P180_S2	Each grant agreement reflects the vesting schedule for that particular grant as determined by the Committee.
891103_11_ITEM8_P180_S3	Broad-based stock option awards to date have generally vested in equal annual installments over a four-year period and RSU awards to date have generally vested in equal annual installments over a five-year period, in each case, from the grant date.
891103_11_ITEM8_P180_S4	PSU awards to date generally cliff vest at the end of a two to three-year period from the date of grant.
891103_11_ITEM8_P180_S5	In addition to equity awards outstanding under the two active plans described above, stock options and other equity awards outstanding under terminated plans and plans assumed in acquisitions are reflected in the information set forth below.
891103_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is reduced by estimated forfeitures, as the expense recorded is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
891103_11_ITEM8_P181_S1	The forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated rate.
891103_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	In connection with the Spin-Off, the majority of outstanding share-based compensation instruments of the Company were modified.
891103_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	This one-time charge was principally related to the acceleration of RSUs granted prior to August 8, 2005 or that were scheduled to vest on or before February 28, 2009.
891103_11_ITEM8_P183_S1	In addition, PSUs granted to non-corporate employees in 2007 were not accelerated but were converted into RSUs with the same vesting schedule.
891103_11_ITEM8_P183_S2	All equity awards held by IAC employees were converted into either awards denominated solely in IAC common shares or a combination of IAC common shares and the common shares of the spun-off businesses, in all cases with appropriate adjustments to the number of shares of common stock, and exercise prices in the case of options, underlying each such award to maintain pre- and post spin-off values.
891103_11_ITEM8_P183_S3	The total incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification was $20.7 million for employees that remained IAC employees following the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM8_P183_S4	This cost will be recognized over the vesting period of the awards.
891103_11_ITEM8_P183_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the period from August 20, 2008 to December 31, 2008, $4.8 million, $8.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of this incremental compensation cost was recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to stock-based compensation was $32.2 million, $26.8 million and $33.7 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	As of December 31, 2010, there was $137.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards.
891103_11_ITEM8_P185_S1	This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.2 years.
891103_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	A summary of changes in outstanding stock options is as follows:
891103_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
891103_11_ITEM8_P187_S1	Approximately 2.4 million, 0.9 million and 15.7 million stock options were granted by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	For purposes of this model, no dividends have been assumed.
891103_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	During 2010, expected stock price volatilities are estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.
891103_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	to 2010, due to the lack of sufficient historical IAC stock price volatilities subsequent to the Spin-Off, expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on historical stock price volatilities of peer companies operating in the same industry sector as IAC.
891103_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields for notes with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date.
891103_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
891103_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 with exercise prices equal to the market prices of IAC's common stock on the date of grant was $6.38, $8.95 and $7.46, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P193_S1	The weighted average exercise price and weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant were $32.00 and $11.05; and $22.69 and $6.48, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P193_S2	There were no stock options issued during the year ended December 31, 2009 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant.
891103_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between IAC's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2010 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM8_P194_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of IAC's common stock.
891103_11_ITEM8_P194_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $16.4 million, $2.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	Cash received from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit realized for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were: $39.1 million and $8.6 million; $3.8 million and $0.8 million; and $8.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2010:
891103_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	RSUs are awards in the form of phantom shares or units, denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of IAC common stock and with the value of each RSU equal to the fair value of IAC common stock at the date of grant.
891103_11_ITEM8_P197_S1	RSUs may be settled in cash, stock or both, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
891103_11_ITEM8_P197_S2	With the exception of awards to non-U.S. employees, which are settled in cash, all awards are settled in stock.
891103_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	Each RSU and PSU grant is subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests.
891103_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	PSUs also include performance-based vesting, where certain performance targets set at the time of grant must be achieved before an award vests.
891103_11_ITEM8_P198_S2	The Company recognizes expense for all RSUs and PSUs for which vesting is considered probable.
891103_11_ITEM8_P198_S3	For RSU grants to U.S. employees, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_11_ITEM8_P198_S4	For PSU grants to U.S. employees, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	The expense associated with RSU awards to non-U.S. employees is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and expensed over the vesting term, subject to mark-to-market adjustments for changes in the price of IAC common stock, as compensation expense within general and administrative expense.
891103_11_ITEM8_P199_S1	At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 0.1 million, less than 0.1 million and 0.1 million international awards were outstanding, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P199_S2	Cash payments related to awards to international employees, including employees of businesses currently presented within discontinued operations, totaled $0.1 million, $0.3 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 there were no outstanding nonvested restricted stock awards.
891103_11_ITEM8_P200_S1	Nonvested RSUs and PSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2010 were as follows:
891103_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	(a) Included in the table are PSUs which cliff vest at the end of two or three years in varying amounts depending upon certain performance conditions.
891103_11_ITEM8_P201_S1	In all, depending on the award the number of shares vesting can range from 0% to 250% of the initial "target" award.
891103_11_ITEM8_P201_S2	The PSU table above includes these awards at their maximum.
891103_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	The weighted average fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 based on market prices of IAC's common stock on the grant date was $23.05, $19.95 and $21.22, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P202_S1	The total fair value of restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $23.6 million, $5.3 million and $72.2 million, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	IAC has granted phantom equity units and stock options in various operating subsidiaries to certain members of the subsidiaries' management.
891103_11_ITEM8_P203_S1	These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events.
891103_11_ITEM8_P203_S2	In some cases, IAC has taken a preferred interest in the subsidiary with a face value equal to the subsidiary's acquisition price or, when funding a start-up business, its investment cost, or a certain other fixed amount.
891103_11_ITEM8_P203_S3	In some cases, these preferred interests accrete with paid-in-kind dividends at a prescribed rate of return.
891103_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	The value of the phantom equity units and stock options is tied to the value of the common stock of the entity, with the equity awards management receives as a whole generally representing a small minority of the total common stock outstanding.
891103_11_ITEM8_P204_S1	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the preferred interest (including the accretion of dividends), our investment cost or other fixed amount or, in the case of stock options, the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_11_ITEM8_P204_S2	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_11_ITEM8_P204_S3	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock or cash at the option of IAC, with fair market value determined by negotiation or arbitration, at various dates through 2015.
891103_11_ITEM8_P204_S4	The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_11_ITEM8_P204_S5	The aggregate number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, as of December 31, 2010 is 3.0 million shares, which is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.
891103_11_ITEM8_P204_S6	The comparable amount as of December 31, 2009 was 2.0 million shares.
891103_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker and executive management view the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	Entities included in discontinued operations, as described in Note 15, are excluded from the tables below except for the schedule of assets, in which they are included in corporate.
891103_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of Media Other, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate operating segments.
891103_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	(a) The Company's primary metric is Operating Income Before Amortization, which is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization of non-cash marketing, (3) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (4) goodwill impairment, (5) pro forma adjustments for significant acquisitions, and (6) one-time items.
891103_11_ITEM8_P208_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it represents the operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which it believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-U.S. GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable U.S. GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-U.S. GAAP measure.
891103_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, goodwill, intangible assets and unamortized non-cash marketing from the measure of segment assets presented above.
891103_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	Revenue by geography is based on where the customer is located.
891103_11_ITEM8_P211_S1	Geographic information about the United States and international territories is presented below:
891103_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	The following tables reconcile Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) for the Company's reporting segments and to net earnings (loss) attributable to IAC shareholders in total (in thousands):
891103_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	The following tables reconcile segment assets to total assets (in thousands):
891103_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	(c) Included in the segment assets of Match is its investment in Meetic, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.
891103_11_ITEM8_P214_S1	(d) Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and IAC's headquarters building.
891103_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	On December 1, 2010, IAC completed the tax-free exchange of Evite, Gifts.com, IAC Advertising Solutions and $217.9 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty's equity stake in IAC resulting in a gain of $140.8 million.
891103_11_ITEM8_P215_S1	In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2010, InstantAction ceased operations.
891103_11_ITEM8_P215_S2	During 2008, IAC completed the Spin-Off and sold EPI for $34.9 million, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $37.4 million and an after-tax gain of $22.3 million.

891103_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with its operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses.
891103_11_ITEM8_P219_S1	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under the data center lease agreement.
891103_11_ITEM8_P219_S2	These operating expenses are not included in the table below.
891103_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	Future minimum payments under operating lease agreements are as follows (in thousands):
891103_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	Expenses charged to operations under these agreements were $31.1 million, $26.4 million and $25.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
891103_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company's most significant operating lease is a 77 year ground lease for IAC's headquarters building in New York City and approximates 60% of the future minimum payments due under all operating lease agreements in the table above.
891103_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	The Company also has funding commitments that could potentially require its performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events, such as under letters of credit extended as follows (in thousands):
891103_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	The letters of credit primarily support the Company's casualty insurance program.
891103_11_ITEM8_P224_S1	The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments, which commitments are reducible or terminable such that these commitments can never exceed associated revenue by a meaningful amount.
891103_11_ITEM8_P224_S2	Purchase obligations also include minimum payments due under telecommunication contracts related to data transmission lines.
891103_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits.
891103_11_ITEM8_P225_S1	The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
891103_11_ITEM8_P225_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_11_ITEM8_P225_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_11_ITEM8_P225_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including tax contingencies, to assess the probability and estimated extent of potential loss.
891103_11_ITEM8_P225_S5	It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.
891103_11_ITEM8_P225_S6	See Note 4 for additional information related to income tax contingencies.
891103_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	During 2010, IAC received a dividend from Meetic, which the Company deemed to be a partial return of its investment.
891103_11_ITEM8_P226_S1	Accordingly, the dividend is reflected as a cash flow from an investing activity in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows.
891103_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	On December 1, 2010, in accordance with the Company's stock exchange agreement with Liberty, IAC exchanged $217.9 million in cash and all the outstanding shares of Celebrate Interactive, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of IAC that held all the equity interests of Evite, Inc., Giftco, Inc. and IAC Advertising, LLC, for substantially all of Liberty's shares of IAC common stock and all of its shares of Class B common stock, which were valued at $364.2 million based on the closing price of IAC common stock on December 1, 2010.
891103_11_ITEM8_P228_S0	On March 10, 2010, Match and Meetic completed a transaction in which Match contributed its Latin American business ("Match Latam") and Meetic contributed Parperfeito to a newly formed venture.
891103_11_ITEM8_P228_S1	These contributions, along with a $3.0 million payment from Match to Meetic, resulted in each party owning a 50% equity interest in the newly formed venture, which was valued at $72 million.
891103_11_ITEM8_P228_S2	Match controls the venture through its voting interests.
891103_11_ITEM8_P228_S3	Accordingly, this transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of Parperfeito and a decrease in ownership of Match Latam.
891103_11_ITEM8_P228_S4	No gain or loss was recognized on this transaction as the fair value of the consideration received by Match equaled the fair value of the assets exchanged.
891103_11_ITEM8_P229_S0	The Company recorded a $4.1 million reduction to the Spin-Off distribution.
891103_11_ITEM8_P229_S1	This reflects a reduction in the Company's income tax liability and a corresponding increase in the income tax liability of the Spincos as of the date of the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM8_P229_S2	This reduced tax liability is primarily due to elections made by the Company pursuant to the tax sharing agreement executed in connection with the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM8_P230_S0	The amount is included in the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity as an increase to additional paid-in-capital.
891103_11_ITEM8_P231_S0	On June 5, 2009, IAC completed the sale of Match Europe to Meetic.

891103_11_ITEM8_P232_S1	In exchange for ReserveAmerica, IAC received approximately 3.5 million shares of Active convertible preferred stock, valued at $33.3 million.
891103_11_ITEM8_P232_S2	No gain or loss was recognized on the sale of ReserveAmerica as the fair value of the Active convertible preferred stock received was equivalent to the carrying value of ReserveAmerica.
891103_11_ITEM8_P233_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2008, $12.3 million in aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes was converted by the holders.
891103_11_ITEM8_P233_S1	Upon conversion, 0.2 million shares of IAC common stock and 0.2 million shares of Expedia common stock were issued to the holders.
891103_11_ITEM8_P234_S0	After the close of trading on August 20, 2008, IAC completed the Spin-Off.
891103_11_ITEM8_P234_S1	The net assets of the Spincos, net of cash of $728.0 million, of $3.2 billion is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of shareholders' equity as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.

891103_11_ITEM8_P238_S2	The Company and Expedia are related parties since they are under common control, given that Mr. Diller serves as Chairman and Senior Executive of both IAC and Expedia.
891103_11_ITEM8_P239_S0	In addition, each of the Company and Expedia has a 50% ownership interest in an aircraft that may be used by both companies.
891103_11_ITEM8_P239_S1	Members of this aircraft's flight crew are employed by an entity in which each of the Company and Expedia has a 50% ownership interest.
891103_11_ITEM8_P239_S2	The Company and Expedia have agreed to share costs relating to flight crew compensation and benefits pro-rata according to each company's respective usage of the aircraft, for which they are separately billed by the entity described above.

891103_11_ITEM8_P240_S0	IAC has a retirement savings plan in the United States that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
891103_11_ITEM8_P240_S1	Participating employees may contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than statutory limits.

891103_11_ITEM8_P240_S5	Investment options in the plan include IAC common stock, but neither participant nor matching contributions are required to be invested in IAC common stock.
891103_11_ITEM8_P241_S0	IAC also has or participates in various benefit plans, principally defined contribution plans, for its international employees.

891103_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Search services generally involve the generation and display of a set of hyperlinks to websites, together with summary information regarding these websites, deemed relevant to search queries entered by users.
891103_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries.
891103_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages in response to search queries that contain advertiser-selected keywords.
891103_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	A paid listing is generally a short textual advertising unit containing a link to the website of an advertiser that purchased the relevant keyword(s).
891103_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Search segment's revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is derived primarily from the display of paid listings, as well as from the display of other advertising in connection with the provision of search and other services.
891103_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The substantial majority of the paid listings we display are supplied to us by Google pursuant to a paid listing supply agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, we transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to us for display in search results.
891103_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as "sponsored" listings on search results pages.
891103_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	To a lesser extent, we also syndicate Google paid listings through third parties with whom we enter into syndication agreements.
891103_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	In addition, we sell display advertising on our destination search and other websites.
891103_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	In the case of CityGrid Media, revenue is derived primarily from the sale of local and national online advertising distributed through CityGrid, our leading local content and advertising network.

891103_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	In addition to a search box and related technology, these toolbars provide users with the ability to access primarily third party online content and services relating to various vertical categories directly from their web browsers.
891103_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	We also market and distribute Ask.com branded and custom toolbars to third parties through the Ask Partner Network, a leading provider of custom applications and search solutions to software, media and other companies.
891103_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Ask Partner Network works closely with third parties to design and develop customized browser-based applications, which are highly-targeted, custom toolbars that, when bundled with third party applications and websites, extend services into web browsers and enhance end-user experiences online.
891103_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	We also operate a number of destination websites and portals through which we provide search and additional services, including: Ask.com, which provides general search services, as well as question and answer services that provide direct answers to natural-language questions; Dictionary.com, which provides online dictionary, reference, educational and learning services; IWON.com, which offers a variety of casual games and sweepstakes; Girlsense.com, which provides a virtual fashion community for girls and teens; MyWebSearch.com, which provides users with home page and search services; MyWay.com, which is free from banner, pop-up and rich-media ads and through which we provide general search and e-mail services; and Excite.com, a content-rich portal that aggregates news, sports, weather and entertainment content.

891103_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Substantially all of the revenue from our Search segment is derived from online advertising, with most of this revenue attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with Google.
891103_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	When a user submits a search query through properties and services within our Search segment and clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of its related paid listing fee with us, which we in turn either retain in its entirety or share with third parties.
891103_12_ITEM1_P31_S2	In some cases, Google does not charge advertisers unless our user, after clicking on the paid listing, also takes certain actions on the advertiser's website.
891103_12_ITEM1_P31_S3	To a lesser extent, revenue is also derived from the sale of display and other advertising pursuant to a variety of advertising models, including on a fixed fee per impression, cost-per-click and cost-per-action basis and the syndication of search results generated by Ask-branded destination search websites.
891103_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to: (i) attract users to our various search properties and search and other services generally; (ii) develop, market and distribute toolbars and related applications; (iii) attract third parties to distribute our toolbars, search boxes and related technology; and (iv) attract advertisers.
891103_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	In the case of our search services, our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search-centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications), third party toolbar, convenience search and applications providers, other search technology and convenience service providers (including internet access providers, social networks, online advertising networks, traditional media companies and companies that provide online content).
891103_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Moreover, some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	In the case of our Mindspark business, we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars and other applications that resonate with consumers (which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features, content and services, some of which may be owned by third parties, with quality search services), differentiate our toolbars and other applications from those of our competitors (primarily through providing customized toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars), secure cost-effective distribution arrangements with third parties and market and distribute toolbars and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner, as well as attract advertisers.
891103_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	In the case of our destination search websites, we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results, answers and other content, the functionality of our various destination search websites and the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of our services generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors.
891103_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our current goal is to differentiate Ask.com from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate, authoritative and direct answers to natural-language questions (in the form of algorithmic search results and/or responses from other Ask.com users).
891103_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	The success of this initiative depends primarily upon our ability to deliver authoritative and trustworthy content to users, as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative.

891103_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	In the case of resellers, advertisers pay resellers for CityGrid Advertising, which resellers in turn share the revenue received with CityGrid Media pursuant to a variety of models, the specifics of which vary by reseller and the substantial majority of which have some performance-based element.
891103_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	When we publish CityGrid Advertising on our owned and operated CityGrid Properties, we retain all of the revenue paid to us by our direct sales customers and all of the amounts paid to us by our resellers.
891103_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	When CityGrid Advertising is published and viewed by an end user on a third party CityGrid Property, we share the related revenue we receive with the applicable third party CityGrid Property.

891103_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	We primarily compete with online and offline local and national directories and online and mobile advertising services and networks.
891103_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	We also face competition from search engines and other site aggregation companies that aggregate our content for display on their websites, which interferes with search engine optimization and marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to CityGrid Properties.

891103_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	The Company makes available, free of charge through its website, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (including related amendments) as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with (or furnished to) the SEC.
891103_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Company's code of ethics, as amended in April 2009, applies to all employees (including all of IAC's executive officers and senior financial officers (including IAC's Chief Financial Officer and Controller)) and directors and is posted on the Company's website at www.iac.com/Investors/amend-and-restated.
891103_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	This code of ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC Regulation S-K and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.
891103_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	Any changes to the code of ethics that affect the provisions required by Item 406 of Regulation S-K, and any waivers of such provisions of the code of ethics for IAC's executive officers, senior financial officers or directors, will also be disclosed on IAC's website.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The use of words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "plans" and "believes," among others, generally identify forward-looking statements.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC's future financial performance, IAC's business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which IAC's businesses operate and other similar matters.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These forward-looking statements are based on IAC management's current expectations and assumptions about future events, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others the risk factors set forth below.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC's business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	IAC does not undertake to update these forward-looking statements.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Mr. Diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As of January 27, 2012, Mr. Diller owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock representing 100% of IAC's outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 43.4% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	As of this date, Mr. Diller also owned 705,734 vested options to purchase IAC common stock and 300,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC's ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	While Mr. Diller may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case IAC would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller's ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller currently is in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC's Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our search services that contain keywords selected and purchased by advertisers through Google.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search-related services.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google's system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to the advertiser) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our search services and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Changes to Google's paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our search services or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our paid listing supply agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its brands and services, including the manner in which Google's paid listings are displayed with search results, and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Noncompliance with Google's guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our toolbars could, if not cured, result in Google's suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners, the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the paid listing supply agreement by Google.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The termination of the paid listing supply agreement by Google, the curtailment of IAC's rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	General economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Accordingly, we continue to compete with traditional media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We believe that the continued growth and continued acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting), the continued growth in commercial use of the internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers and/or software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure and/or opt-in policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We depend, in part, upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into users and customers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	How successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	For example, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to distribute Mindspark toolbars and search boxes to users through third parties.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Most of these agreements are either non-exclusive and short-term in nature or, in the case of long-term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	collectively represent a significant percentage of Mindspark's revenue.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our inability to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute Mindspark toolbars and search boxes through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic, queries and advertising revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	In addition, in the case of the businesses within our Match segment, we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Pursuant to these arrangements, third parties generally promote our services on their websites and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register on our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	These arrangements are generally not exclusive, are short-term in nature and are terminable by either party given notice.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	If existing arrangements with third parties are terminated (or are not renewed upon their expiration) and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues, or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing and/or new third parties in response to industry trends, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In the case of our ServiceMagic business, our ability to drive traffic depends, in part, on the nature and number of service professionals who are members of our network.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	While these professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long-term agreements with them.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, a significant number of our service professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	As a result, our network of service professionals experiences turnover from time to time.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P27_S4	This turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to ServiceMagic.com and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties, we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly and/or in cost-effective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements and/or new products or services to the market.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users, customers and revenues, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	As discussed below, our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing, as well as for the development and introduction of new products, services and enhancements, infrastructure and other related efforts.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In the case of our search engine marketing efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase, as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally, which would increase our costs.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	One of the most cost-effective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	SEO involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The failure to successfully manage SEO efforts across our businesses, including the timely modification of SEO efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In addition, search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Lastly, as discussed above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Any failure to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing industry standards.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The internet and related technologies, applications and devices are characterized by evolving industry standards, coupled with frequent and related new product and service introductions and enhancements.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The development of new product and service introductions and enhancements in response to evolving industry standards requires significant time and resources and we may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-effective manner) to these changes or appropriately time the introduction of new products, services and enhancements to the market and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In the case of certain of our search services, third parties have introduced (and continue to introduce) new or updated technologies, applications and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize these services generally or otherwise make users less likely to use these services (such as through the introduction of features and/or processes that make the access and use of these services cumbersome relative to those of our competitors).
891103_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies and applications (including new and enhanced web browsers) that prevent users from downloading toolbars generally and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will download our toolbars and that previously downloaded toolbars will remain in active use.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In addition, there are technologies and applications that interfere with the functionality of search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and other settings previously selected by users.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	within our toolbars or the address bar of their web browsers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These technologies and applications adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our toolbars, which in turn adversely impacts our revenues.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other search services in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Furthermore, the continued widespread adoption of new internet and telecommunications technologies and devices or other technological changes could require us to modify or adapt our services or infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, services and proprietary technologies obsolete, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	For example, user and usage volumes on mobile devices, including tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our services, we have limited experience with these applications and they may not be compelling to users.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In addition, in the case of certain types of mobile devices, their lower resolution, functionality, display limitations and memory could make the use of our various services through these devices difficult or impossible.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Lastly, existing agreements across our business may need to be amended to address the provision of our services on mobile devices, which the counterparties may be unwilling to do.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P44_S5	The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	To the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology, human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with our existing operations and systems; retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and successfully manage acquisition-related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the U.S.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of these jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	For example, we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures (including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), the staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value-added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the type of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P54_S4	For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Claims could be threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign law for defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and related ads, or content generated by us and our users.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing or linking to third party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Those of our businesses that mention or otherwise incorporate copyrighted material into the content they produce also rely on fair use principles, which allow limited use of copyrighted materials without having to obtain the consent of the copyright holder, provided we satisfy certain legal criteria.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Also, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and imposes additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We face similar risks and costs as our products, services and content are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to consumers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities and while we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other user data (including personal credit card data) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by the respective privacy and data security policies maintained by our various businesses.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Moreover, there are federal, state and international laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and user data.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	There are currently pending several bills in the U.S. Congress, which if passed could result in more onerous requirements regarding the manner in which certain personally identifiable information and other user data will need to be stored and managed.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Additionally, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission released a staff report in December 2010 in which it proposed a new framework for addressing commercial use of consumer data.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Similarly, privacy laws and directives abroad, particularly in Europe, are still developing and could likewise result in onerous requirements.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in the practices and/or privacy policies of our various businesses, which could be costly to implement, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that otherwise negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	could curtail our ability to transact payments.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other similar intellectual property, as critical to our success.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	For example, the businesses within our principal reporting segments, our Search, Match and ServiceMagic reporting segments, rely heavily upon their trademarks (primarily Ask.com and Dictionary.com, our various toolbar brands, Match.com, OkCupid.com, Meetic.com and ServiceMagic.com and related domain names and logos), through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P65_S2	So long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew related trademarks upon their expiration, they will continue to have related trademark protections indefinitely under current trademark laws, rules and regulations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The businesses within our Search segment also rely heavily upon trade secrets, primarily search algorithms through which organic search results are generated.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	To a lesser extent, these businesses also rely upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies and processes, primarily those relating to search-related products and services, with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2027, and copyrighted material, primarily emoticons, characters and other content that is incorporated into, and used in connection with the marketing of, toolbars generally.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our Match segment also relies upon trade secrets and certain patent-pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features, products and services.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our ServiceMagic segment also relies heavily upon trade secrets, primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of local service professionals are matched with consumers, as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Despite these precautions, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructure and those of third parties.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	System interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our businesses.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	To succeed, our systems and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing services, which could adversely affect our business.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Moreover, as traffic to our various websites increases and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructure and technologies generally to facilitate this growth.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P75_S3	If we do not do so, users, customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our services on an intermittent or prolonged basis and the quality of their experiences could be adversely affected.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P75_S4	In addition, we could experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, which could have the same effect.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P75_S5	Moreover, even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems, infrastructure and technology needed to access our services on a timely basis, if at all.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P75_S6	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with customers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide services and/or process certain transactions with customers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Furthermore, data security breaches (as a result of the actions of hackers or otherwise), fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Any event of this nature could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P76_S4	While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P76_S5	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In particular, our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent, surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs, applications and activity that make changes to users' computers and interfere with the overall experience of our services, such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	This type of interference often occurs without disclosure to or consent from users, resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	These disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable, may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In addition, downloadable toolbars through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users' computer or in our systems and networks.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	No assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful and/or that our products and services will not have (or will not be perceived to have) vulnerabilities in this regard.
891103_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.
891103_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	IAC believes that the facilities for its management and operations are generally adequate for its current and near-term future needs.
891103_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	IAC's facilities, most of which are leased by IAC's businesses in various cities and locations in the United States and jurisdictions abroad, generally consist of executive and administrative offices, operations centers, data centers and sales offices.
891103_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	All of IAC's leases are at prevailing market rates.
891103_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	IAC believes that the duration of each lease is adequate.
891103_12_ITEM2_P2_S2	IAC believes that its principal properties, whether owned or leased, are currently adequate for the purposes for which they are used and are suitably maintained for these purposes.
891103_12_ITEM2_P2_S3	IAC does not anticipate any future problems renewing or obtaining suitable leases for its principal properties.
891103_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	IAC's approximately 202,500 square foot corporate headquarters in New York, New York houses offices for IAC corporate and certain other IAC businesses.
891103_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to litigation involving property, personal injury, contract, intellectual property and other claims.
891103_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage.
891103_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the registrant's business, and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
891103_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	In the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation matters which the Company and its subsidiaries are defending, including those described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude.
891103_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to the Company's shareholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to the financial position or operations of the Company based upon the standard set forth in the SEC's rules.
891103_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	In 2006, the Company sold its call-center business, PRC, after conducting an auction process managed by an investment bank.
891103_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	In August 2008, various affiliates of the private-equity firm that won the auction and bought PRC (collectively, "Diamond Castle") sued the Company for breach of contract in New York state court.
891103_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	See Diamond Castle Partners IV PRC, L.P. et al. v. IAC/InterActiveCorp , No. 602427/08 (Supreme Court, New York County).
891103_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	allegedly became unprofitable and later caused PRC to declare bankruptcy.
891103_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	The complaint (as amended in June 2010) seeks damages of up to $138.5 million, Diamond Castle's total investment in PRC.
891103_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	In January 2011, the Company, alleging that during the auction process Diamond Castle had secretly obtained extensive confidential information from PRC's then-CEO, filed counterclaims and third-party claims against Diamond Castle and several of its principals for fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of the non-disclosure agreement governing the auction.
891103_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	In January 2012, IAC amended its pleading to add claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty against PRC's former CEO.
891103_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	The Company believes that Diamond Castle's claims in this lawsuit are without merit and will continue to defend against them, and to prosecute its own claims, vigorously.
891103_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no established public trading market for IAC Class B common stock.
891103_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share for IAC common stock as reported on NASDAQ.
891103_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 24, 2012, there were approximately 1,900 holders of record of the Company's common stock and the closing price of IAC common stock on NASDAQ was $45.19.
891103_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	Because the substantial majority of the outstanding shares of IAC common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, IAC is not able to estimate the total number of beneficial shareholders represented by these record holders.
891103_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	As of February 24, 2012, there was one holder of record of the Company's Class B common stock.
891103_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	In November 2011, IAC's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of common and Class B common stock outstanding, which was paid on December 1, 2011 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 15, 2011.
891103_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	In February 2012, IAC's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of common and Class B common stock outstanding, which is payable on March 1, 2012 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2012.
891103_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	While we currently expect that comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, any future declarations of dividends are subject to the determination of IAC's Board of Directors.
891103_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	During the quarter ended December 31, 2011, the Company did not issue or sell any shares of its common stock or other equity securities pursuant to unregistered transactions.
891103_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	The following table sets forth purchases by the Company of its common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2011:
891103_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	(1) Reflects the average price paid per share of IAC common stock.
891103_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	(2) Reflects repurchases made pursuant to a repurchase authorization previously announced in July 2011.
891103_12_ITEM5_P5_S2	(3) Represents the total number of shares of common stock that remained available for repurchase as of December 31, 2011 pursuant to the July 2011 repurchase authorization.
891103_12_ITEM5_P5_S3	IAC may purchase shares pursuant to this repurchase authorization over an indefinite period of time, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
891103_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data for the five years ended December 31, 2011 should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included herein.
891103_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	IAC operates more than 50 leading and diversified Internet businesses across 30 countries...
891103_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	our mission is to harness the power of interactivity to make daily life easier and more productive for people all over the world.
891103_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	IAC includes the businesses comprising its Search segment; its Match and ServiceMagic segments; the businesses comprising its Media Other segment; as well as investments in unconsolidated affiliates.
891103_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Set forth below are the contributions made by our various segments and corporate operations to consolidated revenue, operating income (loss) and Operating Income Before Amortization (as defined in IAC's Principles of Financial Reporting) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
891103_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciliations by segment of Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss).
891103_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Substantially all of the revenue from our Search segment is derived from online advertising, with most of this revenue attributable to our paid listing supply agreement with Google Inc. ("Google").
891103_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	The revenue earned from our Match segment is derived primarily from subscription fees for its subscription-based online personals services and also from online advertising.
891103_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	ServiceMagic's revenue is derived from fees paid by members of its network of service professionals for consumer leads, regardless of whether the service professional that receives the lead ultimately provides the requested service, as well as from one-time fees charged upon enrollment and activation of new service professionals in its network.
891103_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	The revenue earned by the Media Other segment is derived from merchandise sales, online advertising and content production.
891103_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our various businesses provide supplier partners with important customer acquisition channels and we believe that the ability of our supplier partners to reach a large qualified audience through our services is a significant benefit.
891103_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	While we aim to build and maintain strong relationships with our supplier partners, we may not succeed in these efforts and there is always the risk that certain supplier partners may not make their products and services available to us in the future.
891103_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	A significant component of the Company's revenue is attributable to a paid listing supply agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, revenue earned from Google was $970.4 million, $727.9 million and $561.9 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	The majority of this revenue was earned by the businesses comprising the Search segment.
891103_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	We market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and membership programs, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner.
891103_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
891103_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	We pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments made to partners who distribute Mindspark's customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites.
891103_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	We also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels, such as internet portals and search engines.
891103_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	In addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned.
891103_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	These distribution channels might also offer their own products and services, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
891103_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased, particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the segments in which IAC's businesses operate increases.
891103_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Revenue in 2011 increased from 2010 as a result of increases of $256.7 million from Search, $117.3 million from Match, $23.9 million from Media Other and $23.7 million from ServiceMagic.
891103_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase from Search reflects strong growth from Mindspark's B2B operations and destination websites as well as growth from Mindspark's B2C operations and CityGrid Media.
891103_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	The increase from Match reflects growth from its Core operations (consisting of Match.com in the U.S., People Media and Chemistry) as well as from the impact of Meetic, consolidated beginning September 1, 2011, and OkCupid, acquired January 20, 2011.
891103_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increase from Media Other was driven by growth at Shoebuy, Electus, Notional and Vimeo, partially offset by a decrease from The Daily Beast, which following the formation of The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company joint venture with Harman Newsweek on January 31, 2011, has been accounted for as an equity method investment, a decline at Pronto and the inclusion in 2010 of revenue associated with profit participations related to our former interest in Reveille.
891103_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	The increase from ServiceMagic came from growth in both its domestic and international operations.
891103_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Revenue in 2010 increased from 2009 as a result of increases of $155.4 million from Search, $58.1 million from Match, $51.1 million from Media Other and $25.6 million from ServiceMagic.
891103_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase from Search reflected growth in Mindspark's B2B and B2C operations and destination websites.
891103_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	The increase from Match reflected strong growth from its Core operations, which includes the contribution from People Media, acquired July 13, 2009, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to the sale of Match Europe to Meetic on June 5, 2009.
891103_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	Also contributing to the increase from Match is the impact of Singlesnet, acquired March 2, 2010, and Match's venture with Meetic in Latin America, which was formed March 10, 2010.
891103_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	The increase from Media Other was driven by the contribution from Notional and Electus, which were not in the full prior year period, and growth at Pronto, Shoebuy, CollegeHumor and Vimeo.

891103_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The decrease in depreciation is due to the write-off of certain assets in the prior year period, partially offset by the write-off of $4.9 million in capitalized software costs in the third quarter of 2011 associated with the exit from our direct sponsored listings business.
891103_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	The decrease in general and administrative expense is primarily due to lower professional fees, including a decrease in litigation related expenses, and the inclusion in 2010 of lease termination costs associated with the Ask.com restructuring, partially offset by an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs at Mindspark and CityGrid Media.

891103_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Operating income increased 79% to $201.7 million, primarily due to the increase in Operating Income Before Amortization described above and a decrease of $10.9 million in amortization of intangibles and a slight decrease in non-cash compensation expense.
891103_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The decrease in amortization of intangibles in 2011 is principally due to the inclusion in the prior year of an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $11.0 million as described below.
891103_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	Revenue increased 23% to $837.1 million, reflecting growth in Mindspark's B2B and B2C operations and destination websites.
891103_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase in revenue from Mindspark's B2B operations was attributable to new partners and growth from existing partners, while the increase in revenue from Mindspark's B2C operations and destination websites was driven by increased traffic acquisition efforts and enhancements within our proprietary toolbar business.

891103_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The decrease in selling and marketing expense is primarily due to a decrease of $7.2 million in advertising and promotional expenditures, as 2009 included expenditures associated with the NASCAR partnership and an ad campaign to rebrand the Ask Jeeves UK website, as well as a decrease in compensation and other employee-related costs at CityGrid Media, due in part, to a decrease in average headcount.
891103_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	The increase in traffic acquisition costs is primarily due to an increase in revenue.
891103_12_ITEM7_P64_S3	As a percentage of revenue, traffic acquisition costs increased over the prior year due to an increase in the proportion of revenue from customized browser-based applications at Mindspark's B2B operations and other arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to our websites, as well as a shift in partner mix to partners carrying higher traffic acquisition costs.
891103_12_ITEM7_P64_S4	The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs associated with growth in Mindspark's operations and employee termination costs associated with the Ask.com restructuring that took place in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset by a decrease in litigation related expenses.
891103_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Operating income increased $1.1 billion to $112.9 million, primarily due to the inclusion in 2009 of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges totaling $1.045 billion related to IAC Search Media.

891103_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	In 2009 the Company identified and recorded a goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $916.9 million and $128.3 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	The impairment charges reflected lower projections for revenue and profits at IAC Search Media in future years that reflected the Company's consideration of industry growth rates, competitive dynamics and IAC Search Media's operating strategies and the impact of these factors on the fair value of IAC Search Media and its goodwill and intangible assets.
891103_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	Further contributing to the increase in operating income in the current year is an increase in Operating Income Before Amortization described above and decreases of $18.3 million in amortization of intangibles, exclusive of the impairment charges, and $6.5 million in amortization of non-cash marketing.

891103_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	The increase in accrued revenue share expense is primarily due to an increase in the proportion of revenue from customized browser-based applications and other arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to our websites as well as a shift in partner mix to partners carrying higher traffic acquisition costs.
891103_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	The increase in accrued advertising expense is primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 relative to the fourth quarter of 2009 at Search and Match.
891103_12_ITEM7_P105_S3	The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to the growth in subscription revenue at Match.
891103_12_ITEM7_P105_S4	The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the growth in revenue earned from our paid listing supply agreement with Google; the related receivable from Google was $70.5 million and $53.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM7_P105_S5	While our Match, Media Other and ServiceMagic businesses experienced strong growth, the accounts receivable at these businesses are principally credit card receivables and, accordingly, are not significant in relation to the revenue of these businesses.

891103_12_ITEM7_P108_S3	The increase in income taxes payable was primarily a result of income tax refunds received in 2009 related to the federal carryback of net capital losses generated from the Company's investment in Tree.com, which were recorded as an income tax receivable in 2008 and the receipt of state income tax refunds.
891103_12_ITEM7_P108_S4	The increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and deferred revenue are primarily a result of the growth in our businesses.

891103_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as its cash flows generated from operations.
891103_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	The Company currently does not have in place any formal arrangements that would provide it with external sources of financing such as a revolving credit or other similar facility.
891103_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	The Company has two tranches of warrants outstanding; both with expiration dates of May 7, 2012.
891103_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	At December 31, 2011, the first tranche consists of warrants to acquire 9.8 million shares of IAC common stock at a strike price of $26.86 per share and the second tranche consists of warrants to acquire 4.5 million shares of IAC common stock at a strike price of $31.75 per share.

891103_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	At December 31, 2011, IAC had 8.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
891103_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
891103_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with its expected positive cash flows generated from operations in 2012 will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, share repurchases, quarterly cash dividends, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.
891103_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services.
891103_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	The Company may make acquisitions and investments that could reduce its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and as a result, the Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility.
891103_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.
891103_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	(a) The Company has excluded $303.1 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.

891103_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	IAC reports Operating Income Before Amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_12_ITEM7_P122_S2	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_12_ITEM7_P122_S3	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_12_ITEM7_P122_S4	, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_12_ITEM7_P122_S5	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
891103_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization of non-cash marketing, (3) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (4) goodwill impairment, and (5) one-time items.
891103_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	We believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation, non-cash marketing, and acquisition-related accounting.
891103_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization is presented before one-time items, if applicable.
891103_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	These items are truly one-time in nature and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
891103_12_ITEM7_P125_S2	For the periods presented in this report, there are no one-time items.
891103_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	Non-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based RSUs.
891103_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which, for stock options and RSUs, are included on a treasury method basis, and for performance-based RSUs are included on a treasury method basis once the performance conditions are met.
891103_12_ITEM7_P126_S2	Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	Amortization of non-cash marketing consists of non-cash advertising credits secured from Universal Television as part of the transaction pursuant to which VUE was created, and the subsequent transaction by which IAC sold its partnership interests in VUE (collectively referred to as "NBC Universal Advertising").
891103_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	The NBC Universal Advertising was available for television advertising on various NBC Universal network and cable channels without any cash cost.
891103_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	There are no NBC Universal Advertising credits available as all credits were used prior to December 31, 2009.
891103_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	of its ordinary cost/benefit marketing planning process.
891103_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	Accordingly, the Company's aggregate level of advertising, and the increased concentration of that advertising on NBC Universal network and cable channels, does not reflect what our advertising effort would otherwise be without these credits.
891103_12_ITEM7_P128_S2	As a result, management believes that treating the NBC Universal Advertising as an expense does not appropriately reflect its true cost/benefit relationship, nor does it best reflect the Company's long-term level of advertising expenditures.
891103_12_ITEM7_P128_S3	Nonetheless, while the benefits directly attributable to television advertising are always difficult to determine, and especially so with respect to the NBC Universal Advertising due to its incrementality and heavy concentration, it is likely that the Company does derive benefits from it, though management believes such benefits are generally less than those received through its regular advertising for the reasons stated above.
891103_12_ITEM7_P128_S4	Operating Income Before Amortization therefore has the limitation of including those benefits while excluding the associated expense.
891103_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	Amortization of intangibles (including impairment of intangibles, if applicable) and goodwill impairment (if applicable) are non-cash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions.
891103_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as customer lists, technology and supplier agreements, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	While it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	For a reconciliation of Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	These estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
891103_12_ITEM7_P134_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
891103_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are tested annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2010 related to the Shoebuy and IAC Search Media reporting units and in 2009 related to the IAC Search Media reporting unit.
891103_12_ITEM7_P137_S2	These impairment charges are more fully described above in "Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009".
891103_12_ITEM7_P137_S3	The value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $1.4 billion and $351.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011.
891103_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process.
891103_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_12_ITEM7_P138_S2	In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis.
891103_12_ITEM7_P138_S3	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 20% in both 2011 and 2010.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S4	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S5	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S6	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S7	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
891103_12_ITEM7_P139_S8	In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid.
891103_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value.
891103_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_12_ITEM7_P142_S1	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_12_ITEM7_P144_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_12_ITEM7_P144_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 20% in both 2011 and 2010, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in 2011 and 1% to 10% in 2010.
891103_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	The fair value of each of the Company's six reporting units exceed their carrying values by more than 20% at October 1, 2011, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment.
891103_12_ITEM7_P145_S1	Any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
891103_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	The primary driver in the DCF valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability.
891103_12_ITEM7_P146_S1	Generally, the Company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value.
891103_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	This assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_12_ITEM7_P148_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	During 2011 and 2010 the Company wrote-off certain capitalized software costs.
891103_12_ITEM7_P149_S1	These charges are more fully described above in "Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009".
891103_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	The value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $286.2 million at December 31, 2011.
891103_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	Estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, and reflect management's assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization.
891103_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $260.1 million.
891103_12_ITEM7_P151_S2	Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the IRS, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process.
891103_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_12_ITEM7_P154_S1	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $462.8 million, including interest.
891103_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	As disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2011, 2010 and 2009 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 2.3%, 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, a dividend yield of zero and volatility factors of 30%, 30% and 59%, respectively, based on the historical stock price volatilities of IAC for 2011 and 2010 and peer companies operating in the same industry sector as IAC for 2009 and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 6.1 years, 5.6 years and 4.9 years, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	The historical stock price volatilities in 2009 of peer companies was used due to the lack of sufficient historical IAC stock price volatilities subsequent to the 2008 spin-off.
891103_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	For stock options, including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date (or acquisition date, if applicable) at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term.
891103_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	The impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2011, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor, and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $1.9 million, $9.1 million, and $5.7 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs.
891103_12_ITEM7_P159_S1	For RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation expense over the vesting term.
891103_12_ITEM7_P159_S2	For performance-based RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	The Company invests in certain marketable securities, which primarily consist of short-to-intermediate-term debt securities issued by states of the U.S. and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_12_ITEM7_P160_S1	The unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_12_ITEM7_P160_S2	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_12_ITEM7_P161_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_12_ITEM7_P161_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_12_ITEM7_P161_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_12_ITEM7_P161_S4	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investment in marketable securities to decline.
891103_12_ITEM7_P161_S5	During 2011 and 2010, the Company did not consider any of its marketable securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and long-term debt.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which consist primarily of money market instruments and short-to-intermediate-term debt securities issued by states of the U.S. and subdivisions thereof and investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	During 2011, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by $1.9 million.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Conversely, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of $704.2 million is invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company's outstanding debt is $95.8 million, all of which pays interest at fixed rates.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $10.8 million.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company has four investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	These available-for-sale marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on their quoted market prices with any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, included as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	During 2011, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its available-for-sale marketable equity securities.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	reinvested cash flows from international operations in order to grow the businesses.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The statements of operations of the Company's international businesses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P9_S2	To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenue and operating results.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P9_S3	Similarly, the Company's revenue and operating results will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P9_S4	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the Company is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	These changes, if material, could cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are not material to the Company's earnings in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P12_S0	As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exchange risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P13_S1	However, the Company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency exchange risks.
891103_12_ITEM7A_P13_S2	The Company's objective in managing its foreign currency exchange risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that foreign currency exchange rates might have on its earnings, cash flows and financial position.

891103_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_12_ITEM8_P21_S3	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition and the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash and the investee company's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee company's existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.

891103_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_12_ITEM8_P37_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves.
891103_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
891103_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.
891103_12_ITEM8_P38_S3	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.

891103_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_12_ITEM8_P47_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is computed either on a straight-line basis or based on the period in which the economic benefits of the asset will be realized.
891103_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	Level 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_12_ITEM8_P50_S2	The fair value of the Company's Level 2 financial assets is primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.
891103_12_ITEM8_P50_S3	Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used.

891103_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	These fees are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent the Company can reasonably estimate a probable future economic benefit and the period over which such benefit will be realized (generally 18 months).
891103_12_ITEM8_P55_S3	Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred.
891103_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Amortization of non-cash marketing consists of non-cash advertising credits secured from Universal Television as part of the transaction pursuant to which Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP ("VUE") was created, and the subsequent transaction by which IAC sold its partnership interests in VUE (collectively referred to as the "NBC Universal Advertising").

891103_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
891103_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Basic earnings per share ("Basic EPS") is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
891103_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
891103_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	The financial position and operating results of substantially all foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency.
891103_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period.

891103_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	In connection with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries, management of these businesses has retained an ownership interest.
891103_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	The Company is party to fair value put and call arrangements with respect to these interests.
891103_12_ITEM8_P67_S2	These put and call arrangements allow management of these businesses to require the Company to purchase their interests or allow the Company to acquire such interests at fair value, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P67_S3	These put and call arrangements become exercisable by the Company and the counter-party at various dates over the next five years.

891103_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	A reconciliation of the income tax (benefit) provision to the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes is shown as follows:
891103_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	No U.S. federal or state income taxes have been provided on permanently reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $353.2 million at December 31, 2011.

891103_12_ITEM8_P89_S3	Unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased by $38.3 million due principally to the expiration of statutes of limitations, the effective settlement of audits and a net decrease in deductible temporary differences.
891103_12_ITEM8_P89_S4	Included in unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 is $88.5 million relating to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
891103_12_ITEM8_P89_S5	If unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 are subsequently recognized, $89.5 million and $213.6 million, net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P89_S6	If unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 are subsequently recognized, $103.1 million and $206.9 million, net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P89_S7	In addition, a continuing operations tax provision of $5.1 million would be required upon the subsequent recognition of unrecognized tax benefits for an increase in the Company's valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.

891103_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $60.3 million within twelve months of the current reporting date, of which approximately $13.1 million could decrease income tax provision, primarily due to settlements, expirations of statutes of limitations, and the reversal of deductible temporary differences that will primarily result in a corresponding decrease in net deferred tax assets.
891103_12_ITEM8_P96_S2	An estimate of other changes in unrecognized tax benefits, while potentially significant, cannot be made.
891103_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	In 2009, Match acquired a 27% ownership interest in Meetic.
891103_12_ITEM8_P97_S1	Match accounted for this interest under the equity method of accounting.
891103_12_ITEM8_P97_S2	During the third quarter of 2011, Match acquired an additional 12.5 million shares of Meetic for $272.0 million in cash pursuant to a tender offer.
891103_12_ITEM8_P97_S3	These additional shares increased Match's voting interest and ownership interest in Meetic to 79% and 81%, respectively, resulting in Match obtaining a controlling financial interest in Meetic.
891103_12_ITEM8_P97_S4	Accordingly, this purchase was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the financial results of Meetic are included within IAC's consolidated financial statements and the Match operating segment beginning September 1, 2011.
891103_12_ITEM8_P97_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company included $46.1 million of revenue, net of a $32.6 million write-off of deferred revenue, and a net loss of $8.6 million in its consolidated statement of operations related to Meetic.
891103_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	In connection with the acquisition, Match's 27% equity method investment in Meetic was reduced to its fair value of $132.7 million, resulting in a loss of $11.7 million, which is included within "Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	Included in this loss is $3.2 million of foreign currency translation gains, which were reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	Additionally, Match measured and recorded the acquisition-date fair value of the 19% noncontrolling interest in Meetic, which totaled $101.5 million.
891103_12_ITEM8_P99_S2	The fair values of the 27% equity method investment and the noncontrolling interests were based on the tender offer price of 15.00 per share.
891103_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	Meetic's fair value at the date of acquisition consists of the following components:
891103_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	The table below summarizes the allocation of Meetic's fair value at the date of acquisition to its assets and liabilities:
891103_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	The purchase price the Company paid for the additional 54% interest in Meetic was based on the expected financial performance of Meetic, not on the value of the identifiable assets at the time of acquisition, which resulted in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to goodwill.
891103_12_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Company's expected financial performance of Meetic reflects anticipated synergies between Match and Meetic.
891103_12_ITEM8_P102_S2	Meetic's business model is similar to Match's businesses and we believe increasing our ownership stake allows us to leverage Match's skill in product development, marketing and technology innovation in the online dating space across Europe.
891103_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	Meetic's other current assets, property and equipment, other assets, current liabilities and other liabilities were reviewed and adjusted to their fair values at the date of acquisition, as necessary.

891103_12_ITEM8_P104_S1	The fair value relating to the paid subscribers was determined using an excess earnings methodology and the fair value relating to the registered users who are not paid subscribers was determined using a cost methodology.
891103_12_ITEM8_P104_S2	The fair value of the developed technology was determined using replacement cost methodology.
891103_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	The valuations of the intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows, royalty rates and discount rates.
891103_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	The current deferred tax liability primarily relates to the excess of tax basis over book basis on deferred revenue, which was recorded at fair value in conjunction with the acquisition.
891103_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	The non-current deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to the excess of book basis over tax basis on acquired intangible assets.
891103_12_ITEM8_P106_S2	None of the goodwill is tax deductible.
891103_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of IAC and Meetic as if the acquisition of Meetic had occurred as of January 1, 2010.

891103_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	On January 20, 2011, Match acquired OkCupid for $50.0 million in cash, plus potential additional consideration of up to $40.0 million that was contingent upon OkCupid's 2011 earnings performance.
891103_12_ITEM8_P108_S1	During the second quarter of 2011, the provisions of this contingent consideration arrangement were amended.
891103_12_ITEM8_P108_S2	Pursuant to the amendment, $30.0 million was paid to the former owners of OkCupid, and a potential additional payment of up to $10.0 million was contingent upon revised performance goals.
891103_12_ITEM8_P108_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2011 the revised performance goals were achieved and, accordingly, a liability of $10.0 million relating to the additional payment is included in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011.

891103_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow ("DCF") analyses, and typically corroborates the concluded fair value using a market based valuation approach.
891103_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_12_ITEM8_P111_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_12_ITEM8_P111_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.

891103_12_ITEM8_P115_S2	The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges at Shoebuy reflected expectations of lower revenue and profit performance in future years due to Shoebuy's 2010 fourth quarter revenue and profit performance, which is its seasonally strongest quarter.
891103_12_ITEM8_P115_S3	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at IAC Search Media was primarily due to lower future revenue projections associated with a trade name and trademark based largely upon the impact of 2010's full year results.
891103_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	In connection with its annual assessment and its review of definite-lived intangible assets in 2009, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges at the Search segment related to the write-down of the goodwill and indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets of IAC Search Media of $916.9 million, $104.1 million and $24.2 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges reflected lower projections for revenue and profits at IAC Search Media in future years that reflected the Company's consideration of industry growth rates, competitive dynamics and IAC Search Media's operating strategies and the impact of these factors on the fair value of IAC Search Media and its goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

891103_12_ITEM8_P168_S1	In consideration of Mr. Diller waiving certain pre-existing rights under the Stockholders Agreement with respect to Liberty's transfer to IAC of shares of common stock and Class B common stock, the Company agreed to permit Mr. Diller to exchange with IAC, on a one-for-one basis, from time to time until September 1, 2011 up to 1.5 million shares of common stock for shares of Class B common stock.
891103_12_ITEM8_P168_S2	During 2011, Mr. Diller exchanged 1.5 million shares of common stock for 1.5 million shares of Class B common stock.

891103_12_ITEM8_P169_S1	Under the agreement, Liberty agreed to exchange with IAC an aggregate of 4.3 million shares of common stock described above and an aggregate of 8.5 million shares of Class B common stock for the outstanding shares of Celebrate Interactive, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of IAC, which owned all of the equity interests of Evite, Inc., Giftco, Inc. and IAC Advertising, LLC and $217.9 million in cash.
891103_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	The shares of common stock and Class B common stock exchanged by Liberty represented substantially all of the shares of common stock and all of the shares of Class B common stock owned beneficially and/or of record by Liberty.
891103_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	Following consummation of the above transactions, Mr. Diller, through his own holdings, has 5.8 million shares of IAC's outstanding Class B common stock representing 42.9% of the outstanding total voting power of the Company.
891103_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	IAC's Board of Directors has the authority to designate, by resolution, the powers, preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions of preferred stock issued by IAC without any further vote or action by the shareholders.
891103_12_ITEM8_P172_S1	Any shares of preferred stock so issued would have priority over shares of IAC common stock and shares of IAC Class B common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights or both.

891103_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to IAC shareholders.
891103_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	(a) Amounts in 2010 include the gain on the Liberty Exchange.
891103_12_ITEM8_P181_S1	(b) If the effect is dilutive, weighted average common shares outstanding include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants and vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs").
891103_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 1.0 million shares related to potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_12_ITEM8_P182_S1	(c) For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had losses from continuing operations and as a result, no potentially dilutive securities were included in the denominator for computing dilutive earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_12_ITEM8_P182_S2	Accordingly, the weighted average basic shares outstanding were used to compute all earnings per share amounts.
891103_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	36.2 million shares, respectively, related to potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	(d) There are no performance-based units ("PSUs") included in the denominator for earnings per share as the performance conditions have not been met for the respective reporting periods.
891103_12_ITEM8_P184_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 approximately 3.1 million, 2.9 million and 1.8 million PSUs are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
891103_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	IAC currently has two active plans under which awards have been granted, which cover stock options to acquire shares of IAC common stock, RSUs, PSUs and restricted stock, as well as provide for the future grant of these and other equity awards.
891103_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	These plans are: the IAC 2008 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") and the IAC 2005 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan").
891103_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	Under the 2008 Plan, the Company was originally authorized to grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock and other equity based awards for up to 20.0 million shares of IAC common stock.
891103_12_ITEM8_P186_S1	Under the 2005 Plan, the Company was originally authorized to grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock and other equity based awards for up to 20.0 million shares of IAC common stock, adjusted to reflect IAC's one-for-two reverse stock split in August 2008.
891103_12_ITEM8_P186_S2	The active plans described above authorize the Company to grant awards to its employees, officers, directors and consultants.
891103_12_ITEM8_P186_S3	At December 31, 2011, there were 9.2 million shares available for grant under the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
891103_12_ITEM8_P187_S0	The plans described above have a stated term of ten years and provide that the exercise price of stock options granted will not be less than the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date.
891103_12_ITEM8_P187_S1	The plans do not specify grant dates or vesting schedules as those determinations have been delegated to the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of IAC's Board of Directors (the "Committee").
891103_12_ITEM8_P187_S2	Each grant agreement reflects the vesting schedule for that particular grant as determined by the Committee.
891103_12_ITEM8_P187_S3	Broad-based stock option awards to date have generally vested in equal annual installments over a four-year period and RSU awards to date have generally vested in equal annual installments over a five-year period, in each case, from the grant date.
891103_12_ITEM8_P187_S4	PSU awards to date generally cliff vest at the end of a two to three-year period from the date of grant.
891103_12_ITEM8_P187_S5	In addition to equity awards outstanding under the two active plans described above, stock options and other equity awards outstanding under terminated plans and plans assumed in acquisitions are reflected in the information set forth below.
891103_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is reduced by estimated forfeitures, as the expense recorded is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
891103_12_ITEM8_P188_S1	The forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated rate.
891103_12_ITEM8_P189_S0	The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 related to stock-based compensation was $32.7 million, $32.2 million and $26.8 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P190_S0	At December 31, 2011, there was $107.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.1 years.
891103_12_ITEM8_P191_S0	A summary of changes in outstanding stock options is as follows:
891103_12_ITEM8_P192_S0	The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2011:
891103_12_ITEM8_P193_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between IAC's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2011 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2011.
891103_12_ITEM8_P193_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of IAC's common stock.
891103_12_ITEM8_P193_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $70.6 million, $16.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
891103_12_ITEM8_P194_S1	Approximately 2.6 million, 2.4 million and 0.9 million stock options were granted by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_12_ITEM8_P195_S1	For purposes of this model, no dividends have been assumed.
891103_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	During 2011 and 2010, expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.
891103_12_ITEM8_P196_S1	Prior to 2010, due to the lack of sufficient historical IAC stock price volatilities subsequent to the 2008 spin-off, expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on historical stock price volatilities of peer companies operating in the same industry sector as IAC.
891103_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields for notes with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date.
891103_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
891103_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 with exercise prices equal to the market prices of IAC's common stock on the date of grant was $11.08, $6.38 and $8.95, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	There were no stock options issued during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2009 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant.
891103_12_ITEM8_P199_S2	The weighted average exercise price and weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2010 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant were $32.00 and $11.05, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	Cash received from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit realized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were: $89.8 million and $25.5 million; $39.1 million and $8.6 million; and $3.8 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P201_S0	RSUs are awards in the form of phantom shares or units, denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of IAC common stock and with the value of each RSU equal to the fair value of IAC common stock at the date of grant.
891103_12_ITEM8_P201_S1	RSUs may be settled in cash, stock or both, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
891103_12_ITEM8_P202_S0	Each RSU and PSU grant is subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests.
891103_12_ITEM8_P202_S1	PSUs also include performance-based vesting, where certain performance targets set at the time of grant must be achieved before an award vests.
891103_12_ITEM8_P202_S2	The Company recognizes expense for all RSUs and PSUs for which vesting is considered probable.
891103_12_ITEM8_P202_S3	For RSU grants the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_12_ITEM8_P202_S4	For PSU grants the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	Nonvested RSUs and PSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2011 were as follows:
891103_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	(a) Included in the table are PSUs which cliff vest at the end of two or three years in varying amounts depending upon certain performance conditions.
891103_12_ITEM8_P204_S1	The PSU table above includes these awards at their maximum.
891103_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	The weighted average fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 based on market prices of IAC's common stock on the grant date was $32.41, $23.05 and $19.95, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P205_S1	The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $33.2 million, $23.6 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P206_S0	IAC has granted phantom equity units and stock options in various operating subsidiaries to certain members of the subsidiaries' management.
891103_12_ITEM8_P206_S1	These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events.
891103_12_ITEM8_P206_S2	In some cases, IAC has taken a preferred interest in the subsidiary with a face value equal to the subsidiary's acquisition price or, when funding a start-up business, its investment cost, or a certain other fixed amount.
891103_12_ITEM8_P206_S3	In some cases, these preferred interests accrete with paid-in-kind dividends at a prescribed rate of return.
891103_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	The value of the phantom equity units and stock options is tied to the value of the common stock of the entity, with the equity awards management receives as a whole generally representing a small minority of the total common stock outstanding.
891103_12_ITEM8_P207_S1	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the preferred interest (including the accretion of dividends), our investment cost or other fixed amount or, in the case of stock options, the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_12_ITEM8_P207_S2	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_12_ITEM8_P207_S3	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock or cash at the option of IAC, with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration, at various dates through 2016.
891103_12_ITEM8_P207_S4	The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_12_ITEM8_P207_S5	The aggregate number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, as of December 31, 2011 is 2.2 million shares, which is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.
891103_12_ITEM8_P207_S6	The comparable amount as of December 31, 2010 was 3.0 million shares.
891103_12_ITEM8_P208_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker and executive management view the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_12_ITEM8_P208_S1	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of Media Other, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate operating segments.
891103_12_ITEM8_P209_S0	(a) The Company's primary metric is Operating Income Before Amortization, which is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization of non-cash marketing, (3) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (4) goodwill impairment and (5) one-time items.
891103_12_ITEM8_P209_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it represents the operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which it believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_12_ITEM8_P210_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation, non-cash marketing, and acquisition related accounting.
891103_12_ITEM8_P211_S0	the limitations of the non-U.S. GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable U.S. GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-U.S. GAAP measure.
891103_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.
891103_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	Revenue by geography is based on where the customer is located.
891103_12_ITEM8_P213_S1	Geographic information about revenue and long-lived assets is presented below:
891103_12_ITEM8_P214_S0	The following tables reconcile Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) for the Company's reportable segments:
891103_12_ITEM8_P215_S0	The following tables reconcile segment assets to total assets:
891103_12_ITEM8_P216_S0	(c) Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and IAC's headquarters building.
891103_12_ITEM8_P216_S1	(d) Included in the segment assets of Match at December 31, 2010 is its investment in Meetic, which was accounted for as an equity method investment.
891103_12_ITEM8_P216_S2	During the third quarter of 2011, Match obtained a controlling financial interest in Meetic.
891103_12_ITEM8_P216_S3	Accordingly, this purchase was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
891103_12_ITEM8_P217_S0	The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with its operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses.
891103_12_ITEM8_P217_S1	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under the data center lease agreement.
891103_12_ITEM8_P217_S2	These operating expenses are not included in the table below.
891103_12_ITEM8_P218_S0	Future minimum payments under operating lease agreements are as follows:
891103_12_ITEM8_P219_S0	Expenses charged to operations under these agreements were $31.3 million, $31.1 million and $26.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
891103_12_ITEM8_P220_S0	The Company's most significant operating lease is a 77 year ground lease for IAC's headquarters building in New York City and approximates 66% of the future minimum payments due under all operating lease agreements in the table above.
891103_12_ITEM8_P221_S0	The Company also has funding commitments that could potentially require its performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events, such as under letters of credit extended as follows:
891103_12_ITEM8_P222_S0	The guarantee relates to the Company's guarantee of an equity method investee's debt.
891103_12_ITEM8_P222_S1	The letters of credit support the Company's casualty insurance program.
891103_12_ITEM8_P223_S0	The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments, which commitments are reducible or terminable such that these commitments can never exceed associated revenue by a meaningful amount.
891103_12_ITEM8_P223_S1	Purchase obligations also include minimum payments due under telecommunication contracts related to data transmission lines.
891103_12_ITEM8_P224_S0	In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits.
891103_12_ITEM8_P224_S1	The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
891103_12_ITEM8_P224_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_12_ITEM8_P224_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_12_ITEM8_P224_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including tax contingencies, to assess the probability and estimated extent of potential loss.
891103_12_ITEM8_P224_S5	It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.
891103_12_ITEM8_P224_S6	See Note 4 for additional information related to income tax contingencies.
891103_12_ITEM8_P225_S0	On February 8, 2011, in connection with the Liberty Exchange, the Company received 0.1 million shares of IAC common stock, valued at $2.9 million, in fulfillment of post-closing working capital adjustments.

891103_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	All references to "IAC," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us" in this report are to IAC/InterActiveCorp.
891103_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our History IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in July 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc.
891103_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into the leading media and internet company it is today.
891103_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	From 1997 through 2001, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group (and the remaining interest in 1998) and Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com), as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies.
891103_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	As its transformation from a hybrid media/electronic retailing company continued to evolve, in May 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Expedia.com and contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, or VUE, a joint venture then controlled by Vivendi.
891103_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	The Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire), in 2003.
891103_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. (now known as IAC Search Media, Inc.) and, on August 9, 2005, completed the separation of its travel and travel related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. That year, IAC also sold its common and preferred interests in VUE to NBC Universal.
891103_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	In July 2008, the Company acquired the Lexico Publishing Group, owner of various reference websites, including Dictionary.com.
891103_13_ITEM1_P3_S4	On August 20, 2008, IAC separated into five publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster and Tree.com, Inc.
891103_13_ITEM1_P3_S5	In this report, we refer to this 2008 transaction as the Spin-Off.
891103_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Immediately following the Spin-Off, IAC effected a one-for-two reverse stock split.
891103_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	In June 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic, S.A. ("Meetic"), a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a 5 million note.
891103_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	In July 2009, we acquired PeopleMedia, Inc., operator of a number of demographically targeted dating websites.
891103_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	In December 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation's equity stake in IAC.
891103_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	See Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8-Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
891103_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	In February 2011, we acquired OkCupid, an ad supported online personals service.
891103_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	During the third quarter of 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%.
891103_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	In September 2012, we acquired The About Group.
891103_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	In December 2012, we acquired Tutor, an online tutoring service.
891103_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis.
891103_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	and Senior Executive, owned 5,789,499 shares of Class B common stock (the "Diller Shares") representing 100% of IAC's outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 42.5% of the outstanding total voting power of IAC.
891103_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	Pursuant to an agreement between Mr. Diller and IAC, certain transfer restrictions apply to 1.5 million of the Diller Shares, including a requirement that, until December 1, 2015 and except for transfers to certain permitted transferees, the Diller Shares must first be converted into common stock in order to be transferred.
891103_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC's ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
891103_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller's ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller is currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC's Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	DESCRIPTION OF IAC BUSINESSES Search Applications Overview Our Search Applications segment consists of:
891103_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Applications, including our direct to consumer downloadable applications business ( B2C ) and our partnership operations ( B2B ), as well as our Ask.com and Dictionary.com downloadable applications.
891103_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our Websites and Applications businesses provide search services to our users.
891103_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	These search services generally involve the generation and display of a set of hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users.
891103_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries.
891103_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to an advertiser's website.
891103_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by the advertiser.
891103_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	The paid listings we display are furnished by Google Inc.
891103_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	("Google") pursuant to a services agreement.
891103_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	Websites Our Websites, through which we provide search, content and other services, primarily consist of the following destination websites:
891103_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	Dictionary.com, which provides online dictionary, reference, educational and learning services.
891103_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Our B2C applications business develops, markets and distributes a variety of downloadable applications that offer users the ability to access search services, as well as engage in a number of other activities online, such as play games, send e-cards, decorate e-mails and web pages and explore select vertical categories.
891103_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	The majority of our B2C applications are toolbars, which consist of a browser search box and related technology (which together enable users to run search queries and otherwise access search services directly from their web browsers).
891103_13_ITEM1_P15_S2	Many of our toolbars are coupled with other applications that we have developed that enable users to personalize their online activities and otherwise make them more expressive and fun.
891103_13_ITEM1_P15_S3	These applications include: MyFunCards, through which users can send online greeting cards; Popular Screensavers, through which users can personalize their desktops with photos, images and animations; and Retrogamer and Gaming Wonderland, through which users can access classic arcade, sports and action and other casual games directly from their web browsers.
891103_13_ITEM1_P15_S4	Other B2C applications target users with a special or passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as television programming, sports, shopping and gossip, among others) or that provide users with particular reference information (such as maps or weather forecasts).
891103_13_ITEM1_P15_S5	These applications include: Television Fanatic, through which users can browse and search for scheduling information, episode synopses and actor profiles for television shows, as well as directly access online episodes via media players and links to related third party services; TotalRecipeSearch, through which users can access thousands of recipes and cooking tips; and Coupon Alert, through which users can access coupons and online promotions.
891103_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	We distribute B2C applications directly to consumers free of charge.
891103_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our B2B applications business works closely with partners in the software, media and other industries to design and develop customized browser based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners' products and services.
891103_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	We also market and distribute a number of downloadable applications through which we provide search and additional services, including: the Ask.com iPhone, iPad and Android applications, which provide general search and natural language question and answer services, and the Dictionary.com iPhone, iPad and Android applications, which provide dictionary, reference, educational and learning services.
891103_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	Revenue Substantially all of the revenue from our Search Applications segment is derived from online advertising, primarily from the display of paid listings, as well as from the display of other advertising in connection with the provision of search, content and other services.
891103_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The substantial majority of the paid listings we display are supplied to us by Google pursuant to a services agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, we transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to us for display in search results.
891103_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages.
891103_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	When a user submits a search query through our Search Applications properties and services and clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of its related paid listing fee with us, which we in turn either retain in its entirety or share with third parties.
891103_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	To a lesser extent, we also syndicate Google paid listings through third parties with whom we enter into syndication agreements.
891103_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	See Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	Revenue is also derived from the sale of display, content based and other advertising pursuant to a variety of advertising models and the syndication of search results generated by Ask-branded destination search websites.
891103_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Competition We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to: (i) attract users to our various Search Applications properties and services generally; (ii) develop, market and distribute our B2C and B2B applications; (iii) attract third parties to distribute our Applications and related technology; and (iv) attract advertisers.
891103_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	In the case of our search services generally, our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications), third party toolbar, convenience search and applications providers, other search technology and convenience service providers (including internet access providers, social media platforms, online advertising networks, traditional media companies and companies that provide online content).
891103_13_ITEM1_P22_S2	When we market our search and content services, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results.
891103_13_ITEM1_P22_S3	Moreover, some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_13_ITEM1_P22_S4	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_13_ITEM1_P22_S5	In the case of our Websites, we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results, answers and other content, the functionality of our various Websites and the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of the services provided by our Websites generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors.
891103_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	We believe that we differentiate Ask.com from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate, authoritative and direct answers to natural language questions (in the form of algorithmic search results and/or responses from other Ask.com users).
891103_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our ability to continue to differentiate Ask.com from its competitors in this manner depends primarily upon our ability to deliver authoritative and trustworthy content to users, as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative.
891103_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the case of our Applications, we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to create toolbars and other applications that resonate with consumers (which requires that we continue to bundle attractive features, content and services, some of which may be owned by third parties, with quality search services), differentiate our toolbars and other applications from those of our competitors (primarily through providing customized toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars), secure cost-effective distribution arrangements with third parties and market and distribute our toolbars and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner.

891103_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

891103_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	Consumers can then review home services professional profiles and select the professional that they believe best meets their specific needs.
891103_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	In all cases, if a match is made, the consumer is under no obligation to work with home service professionals referred by HomeAdvisor.

891103_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	HomeAdvisor's revenue is derived from fees paid by members of our network of home services professionals for matches with consumers made by HomeAdvisor, regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service, as well as from fees charged upon the enrollment and activation of new home services professionals in our network.

891103_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	The markets for local business advertising and content are highly competitive and diverse.

891103_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	We also face competition from search engines and other site aggregation companies that aggregate our content for display on their websites, which interferes with search engine optimization and marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to properties and applications affiliated with the CityGrid advertising network.

891103_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	The Company's code of ethics, as amended in April 2009, applies to all employees (including all of IAC's executive officers and senior financial officers (including IAC's Chief Financial Officer and Controller)) and directors and is posted on the Company's website at http://ir.iac.com/corporate-governance-document.cfm?DocumentID=11372.

891103_13_ITEM1_P59_S3	Any changes to the code of ethics that affect the provisions required by Item 406 of Regulation S-K, and any waivers of such provisions of the code of ethics for IAC's executive officers, senior financial officers or directors, will also be disclosed on IAC's website.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The use of words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, plans and believes, among others, generally identify forward looking statements.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These forward looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC's future financial performance, IAC's business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which IAC's businesses operate and other similar matters.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These forward looking statements are based on IAC management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the risk factors set forth below.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC's business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S7	IAC does not undertake to update these forward looking statements.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Risk Factors Mr. Diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S9	As of February 1, 2013, Mr. Diller owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock representing 100% of IAC's outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 42.5% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S10	As of this date, Mr. Diller also owned 780,734 vested options to purchase IAC common stock and 225,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S11	In addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC's ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve month period.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P1_S12	While Mr. Diller may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case IAC would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller's ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller currently is in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC's Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Search Applications properties.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P3_S7	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search related services.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google's system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to the advertiser) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Search Applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes to Google's paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our Search Applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our services agreement with Google requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its brands and services, including the manner in which Google's paid listings are displayed within search results, and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Noncompliance with Google's guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our toolbars could, if not cured, result in Google's suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners, the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by Google.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of IAC's rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	General economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S7	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Many advertisers still have limited experience with online advertising and may continue to devote significant portions of their advertising budgets to traditional offline advertising media.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Accordingly, we continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We believe that the continued growth and continued acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting and/or utilize mobile devices), the continued growth in commercial use of the internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure and/or opt-in policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We depend, in part, upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products and services.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	How successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	For example, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to distribute Search Applications search boxes, toolbars and other applications to users through third parties.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Most of these agreements are either non exclusive and short term in nature or, in the case of long term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our B2B applications.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Our inability to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute our search boxes, toolbars and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S8	In addition, in the case of the businesses within our Match segment, we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Pursuant to these arrangements, third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through e-mail campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to or register with our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S10	These arrangements are generally not exclusive, are short term in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P8_S11	If existing arrangements with third parties are terminated (or are not renewed upon their expiration) and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues, or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing and/or new third parties in response to industry trends, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In the case of our HomeAdvisor business, our ability to drive traffic depends, in part, on the nature and number of home services professionals who are members of our network.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	While these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long term agreements with them.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	As a result, our network of home services professionals experiences turnover from time to time.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	This turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to HomeAdvisor.com and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties, we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S6	We may not be able to adapt quickly and/or in cost-effective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements and/or new products or services to the market.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users, customers and revenues, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As discussed below, our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing, as well as for the development and introduction of new products, services and enhancements, infrastructure and other related efforts.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In the case of our search engine marketing efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase, as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally, which would increase our costs.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	of sellers and publishers of advertising may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	One of the most cost-effective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	SEO involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The failure to successfully manage SEO efforts across our businesses, including the timely modification of SEO efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Lastly, as discussed above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any failure to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and enhance our various brands.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of highly-recognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We believe that our success depends, in part, upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance these brands.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Moreover, the failure to market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact our various brands, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P15_S12	The internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the internet, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, requires significant time and resources.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-effective manner) to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately (and/or in a cost effective manner) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In the case of certain of our Applications, third parties have introduced (and continue to introduce) new or updated technologies, applications and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize these Applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use these services (such as through the introduction of features and/or processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use these services relative to those of our competitors).
891103_13_ITEM1A_P16_S5	For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies and applications (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, there are technologies and applications that interfere with the functionality of (or settings changes made by) our Applications.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	These technologies, applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our Applications, which in turn adversely impacts our revenues.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to opt out of our advertising products.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other Applications in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	While most of our users currently access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services and intend to continue to do so in the future, we have limited experience with mobile applications, both in terms of development and monetization.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Moreover, mobile versions of our products and services that we develop may not be compelling to users and/advertisers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Even if we are able to develop mobile applications that resonate with users and advertisers, the success of these applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Lastly, as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread, the usage of certain of our products and services may not translate to mobile devices, which shift could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including credit card data) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	For example, if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy, it could become subject to an investigation and proceeding brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act, as well as a private lawsuit under various U.S. federal and state laws.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In general, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	U.S. legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In February 2012, the White House released a proposed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, which is intended to serve as a framework for new privacy legislation.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In March 2012, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission released a staff report making recommendations for businesses and policy makers in the area of consumer privacy.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Similarly, new privacy laws and directives abroad, particularly in Europe, are being proposed and implemented.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, existing privacy laws that were intended for brick-and-mortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws) in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses and/or limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities, such as targeted advertising, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data, credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies, federal, state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or PCI standards and/or the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisitions candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	successfully manage acquisition related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S7	For example, we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures (including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), the staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For example, through our various businesses we post and link to third party content, including third party advertisements, links and websites, as well as content submitted by users, such as comments, photographs and videos.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We could be subject to liability for posting or linking to third party content, and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims, we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Some laws, including the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	For example, the DMCA generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on use of third party content, so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	However, the scope and applicability of the DMCA are subject to judicial interpretation and, as such, remain uncertain, and the U.S. Congress may enact legislation limiting the protections afforded by the DMCA to online service providers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Moreover, similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P30_S7	As a result, claims could be threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting, among other things, defamation, invasion of privacy or right or publicity, copyright infringement or trademark infringement.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S6	We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other similar intellectual property, as critical to our success.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S7	For example, the businesses within our principal reporting segments (Search Applications, Match and Local) rely heavily upon their trademarks (primarily Ask.com and Dictionary.com, our various toolbar brands, Match.com, OkCupid.com, Meetic.com and HomeAdvisor.com and related domain names and logos), through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P31_S8	So long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew trademark registrations as required, they will continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws, rules and regulations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The businesses within our Search Applications segment also rely upon trade secrets, including algorithms for the generation, organization and presentation of search results.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	To a lesser extent, these businesses also rely upon patented and patent pending proprietary technologies and processes, primarily those relating to search related products and services, with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2027, and copyrighted material, primarily emoticons, characters and other content that is incorporated into, and used in connection with the marketing of, toolbars generally.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our Match segment also relies upon trade secrets and certain patent pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features, products and services.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	HomeAdvisor also relies heavily upon trade secrets, primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of home services professionals are matched with consumers, as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P32_S8	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	To succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S4	From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services, which could adversely affect our business.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Moreover, as traffic to our websites, applications and online properties increases and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S6	If we do not do so, users, customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or prolonged basis, which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S7	In addition, we could experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, which could have the same effect.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Moreover, even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems, infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis, if at all.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S9	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S10	We also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S11	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S12	Furthermore, data security breaches (as a result of actions taken by hackers or otherwise), fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S13	Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
891103_13_ITEM1A_P35_S14	While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.

891103_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Included in the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock are proceeds of $76.0 million from the exercise of warrants to acquire 3.2 million shares of IAC common stock.
891103_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	The weighted average strike price of the warrants was $26.90 per share.
891103_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	Net cash provided by operating activities attributable to continuing operations in 2010 was $ 340.7 million and consists of a loss from continuing operations of $ 9.4 million , adjustments for non-cash items of $241.0 million and cash provided by working capital activities of $109.1 million.
891103_13_ITEM7_P52_S5	Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consists of $ 84.3 million of non-cash compensation expense, $ 63.9 million of depreciation, $ 28.0 million of goodwill impairment, $ 27.5 million of amortization of intangibles, which includes an impairment charge of $15.5 million and $ 25.7 million of equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	income taxes payable, an increase of $ 54.2 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue of $ 19.7 million , partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $ 32.9 million .
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The increase in income taxes payable was primarily a result of income tax refunds received in 2010 related to the federal carryback of net capital losses generated from the sale of ARO stock in 2009 and the receipt of refundable New York State tax credits under the Brownfield Cleanup Program Act, which were recorded as an income tax receivable in 2007 and principally related to the construction of the Company's headquarters building in New York City.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	The increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued revenue share expense and an increase in accrued advertising expense.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	The increase in accrued revenue share expense is primarily due to an increase in the proportion of revenue from our B2B customized browser-based applications and other arrangements with third parties who direct traffic to our websites as well as a shift in partner mix to partners carrying higher traffic acquisition costs.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	The increase in accrued advertising expense is primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 relative to the fourth quarter of 2009 at Search Applications and Match.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to the growth in subscription revenue at Match.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S6	The increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the growth in revenue earned from our services agreement with Google; the related receivable from Google was $ 70.5 million and $ 53.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S7	While our Match, Media and HomeAdvisor businesses experienced strong growth, the accounts receivable at these businesses are principally credit card receivables and, accordingly, are not significant in relation to the revenue of these businesses.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S8	Net cash used in investing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2010 of $ 118.1 million includes net purchases of marketable debt securities of $ 74.8 million , capital expenditures of $ 39.8 million primarily related to the internal development of software to support our offerings and our increased number of users, cash consideration used in acquisitions and investments of $ 19.6 million primarily related to the acquisitions of Singlesnet and DailyBurn.com, partially offset by a cash dividend of $ 11.4 million received from Meetic.
891103_13_ITEM7_P53_S9	Net cash used in financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2010 of $ 717.2 million includes $ 539.6 million for the repurchase of 23.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $22.98 per share and $ 217.9 million in cash related to the Liberty Exchange described below, partially offset by proceeds related to the issuance of common stock, net of withholding taxes of $ 25.9 million and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $ 14.3 million .

891103_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as its cash flows generated from operations.
891103_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Company has a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which is available as an additional source of financing.
891103_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	At December 31, 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
891103_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations.
891103_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Company expects that 2013 capital expenditures will be higher than 2012.
891103_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	At December 31, 2012, IAC had 3.1 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
891103_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
891103_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	On February 5, 2013, IAC declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common and Class B common stock outstanding; the dividend is payable on March 1, 2013 to stockholders of record on February 15, 2013.
891103_13_ITEM7_P56_S2	Future declarations of dividends are subject to the determination of IAC's Board of Directors.
891103_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with its expected positive cash flows generated from operations in 2013 and available borrowing capacity under its $300.0 million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, share repurchases, quarterly cash dividends, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.
891103_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services.
891103_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The Company may make acquisitions and investments that could reduce its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and as a result, the Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility.
891103_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.
891103_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company has excluded $340.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.
891103_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	For additional information on income taxes, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	(b) Represents contractual amounts due including interest.
891103_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	(c) The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments, which commitments are reducible or terminable such that these commitments can never exceed associated revenue by a meaningful amount.
891103_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	Purchase obligations also include minimum payments due under telecommunication contracts related to data transmission lines.
891103_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (d) Commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events.
891103_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the items described above, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2012.
891103_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	IAC'S PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING IAC reports Operating Income Before Amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_13_ITEM7_P63_S4	, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_13_ITEM7_P63_S5	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
891103_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Definition of IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Operating Income Before Amortization is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (3) goodwill impairment, and (4) one-time items.
891103_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	We believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation and acquisition-related accounting.
891103_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	One-Time Items Operating Income Before Amortization is presented before one-time items, if applicable.
891103_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	These items are truly one-time in nature and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
891103_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	For the periods presented in this report, there are no one-time items.
891103_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Non-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based RSUs.
891103_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which, for stock options and RSUs, are included on a treasury method basis, and for performance-based RSUs are included on a treasury method basis once the performance conditions are met.
891103_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Amortization of intangibles (including impairment of intangibles, if applicable) and goodwill impairment (if applicable) are non-cash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions.
891103_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as content, technology, advertiser and supplier relationships and customer lists, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	While it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME BEFORE AMORTIZATION For a reconciliation of Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
891103_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
891103_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	The annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2010 related to the Shoebuy and Search Applications reporting units.
891103_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	The value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $ 1.6 billion and $379.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012.
891103_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	In 2012, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-08, "Testing Goodwill for Impairment," which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P74_S4	If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary.
891103_13_ITEM7_P74_S5	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value then goodwill must be tested for impairment using a two-step process.
891103_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis.
891103_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 25% in 2012 and 13% to 20% in 2011.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S5	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S6	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S7	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
891103_13_ITEM7_P76_S8	In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid.
891103_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The fair value of each of the Company's seven reporting units, excluding Tutor which was acquired in December 2012, exceed their carrying values by more than 20% at October 1, 2012, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment.
891103_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	Any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The primary driver in the DCF valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability.
891103_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	Generally, the Company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	This assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	In 2012, the Company adopted ASU 2012-02, "Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment," which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P79_S2	If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined.
891103_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value then the fair value of asset must be determined and compared to its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	The estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10% to 18% in 2012 and 13% to 20% in 2011, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2012 and 2011.
891103_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	During 2011 the Company wrote-off certain capitalized software costs.
891103_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $374.5 million at December 31, 2012.
891103_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	Income Taxes Estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, and reflect management's assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization.
891103_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $303.0 million.
891103_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process.
891103_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured for purposes of financial statement recognition as the largest amount of benefit which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $496.8 million, including interest.
891103_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Stock-Based Compensation As disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2012, 2011 and 2010 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 0.6%, 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively, a dividend yield of 1.2%, zero and zero, respectively, volatility factors of 31%, 30% and 30%, respectively, based on the historical stock price volatilities of IAC and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 4.4 years, 6.1 years and 5.6 years, respectively.
891103_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	For stock options, including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date (or acquisition date, if applicable) at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term.
891103_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor, and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $2.2 million, $10.4 million, and $5.0 million, respectively.
891103_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs.
891103_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	For RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation expense over the vesting term.
891103_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Marketable Securities The Company invests in certain marketable securities, which primarily consist of short-to-intermediate-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	The unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_13_ITEM7_P96_S4	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investment in marketable securities to decline.
891103_13_ITEM7_P96_S5	During 2012, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $8.7 million related to one of its long-term marketable equity securities.
891103_13_ITEM7_P96_S6	During 2011, the Company did not consider any of its marketable securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and long-term debt, including the current portion thereof.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which consist primarily of money market instruments and short-to-intermediate-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	During 2012, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 2012, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by less than $0.1 million.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S6	Conversely, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of $ 750.0 million is invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S7	At December 31, 2012, the Company's outstanding debt is $595.8 million, all of which pays interest at fixed rates.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S8	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S9	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $49.9 million.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P1_S10	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	At December 31, 2012, the Company has three investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	These available-for-sale marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on their quoted market prices with any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, included as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	During 2012, the Company recorded an $8.7 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to one of its available-for-sale marketable equity securities.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The other-than-temporary impairment charge is included in "Other (expense) income, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	However, the exposure is mitigated since the Company has generally reinvested cash flows from international operations in order to grow the businesses.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The statements of operations of the Company's international businesses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenue and operating results.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Similarly, the Company's revenue and operating results will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P5_S4	The economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the Company is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P5_S5	These changes, if material, could cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are not material to the Company's earnings in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exchange risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	However, the Company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency exchange risks.
891103_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Company's objective in managing its foreign currency exchange risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that foreign currency exchange rates might have on its earnings, cash flows and financial position.

891103_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	financial matters of the investee are accounted for using the cost method.
891103_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition and the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash and the investee company's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee company's existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.

891103_13_ITEM8_P28_S5	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves.
891103_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
891103_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.
891103_13_ITEM8_P30_S3	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
891103_13_ITEM8_P30_S4	The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments.

891103_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
891103_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	During 2011, the Company wrote-off $4.9 million in capitalized software costs associated with the exit of the Company's direct sponsored listings business.

891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that are expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	In 2012, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-08, "Testing Goodwill for Impairment", which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S4	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the goodwill must be tested using a two-step process based on prior accounting guidance, and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S5	The Company also adopted Accounting Standards Update 2012-02 "Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment" in 2012, which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S6	If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S7	If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, then the indefinite-lived intangible asset must be tested based on prior accounting guidance, and if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S8	See Note 6 for discussion of impairment charges recorded in 2010.
891103_13_ITEM8_P33_S9	There are no impairment charges recorded in 2012 and 2011.
891103_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company's reporting units are consistent with its determination of its operating segments.
891103_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
891103_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Media and Other include other operating segments that do not have goodwill.
891103_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	See Note 15 for additional information regarding the Company's method of determining operating and reportable segments.
891103_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	The fair value of each of the Company's seven reporting units, excluding Tutor which was acquired in December 2012, exceed their carrying values by more than 20% at October 1, 2012, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment.
891103_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Definite Lives Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is computed either on a straight-line basis or based on the period in which the economic benefits of the asset will be realized.
891103_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Level 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	The fair value of the Company's Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.
891103_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used.
891103_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
891103_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of fair value measurements made using Level 3 inputs.
891103_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity and cost method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.
891103_13_ITEM8_P43_S1	Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.
891103_13_ITEM8_P43_S2	See Note 6 for a discussion of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and Note 8 for a discussion of impairment charges related to equity and cost method investments.
891103_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Traffic Acquisition Costs Traffic acquisition costs consist of payments made to partners who distribute our B2B customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites.
891103_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements.
891103_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company expenses these payments as a component of cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred (when the advertisement first runs for production costs that are initially capitalized) and represent online marketing, including fees paid to search engines and third parties that distribute our B2C downloadable applications, and offline marketing, principally television and radio advertising.
891103_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	Advertising expense is $779.7 million , $497.2 million and $371.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company capitalizes and amortizes the costs associated with certain distribution arrangements that require it to pay a fee per access point delivered.
891103_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	These access points are generally in the form of downloadable applications associated with our B2C operations.
891103_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	These fees are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent the Company can reasonably estimate a probable future economic benefit and the period over which such benefit will be realized (generally 18 months).
891103_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred.
891103_13_ITEM8_P46_S4	Legal Costs Legal costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company records interest, net of any applicable related income tax benefit, on potential income tax contingencies as a component of income tax expense.
891103_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
891103_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Basic earnings per share ("Basic EPS") is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
891103_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	Diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vested resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
891103_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	The financial position and operating results of substantially all foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency.
891103_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
891103_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity.
891103_13_ITEM8_P51_S3	Transaction gains and losses resulting from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of other (expense) income, net.
891103_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Translation gains and losses relating to foreign entities that are liquidated or substantially liquidated are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	Such gains totaled $9.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 , and are included in "Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the requisite service period.
891103_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	See Note 14 for a further description of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	In connection with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries, management of these businesses has retained an ownership interest.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	The Company is party to fair value put and call arrangements with respect to these interests.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	These put and call arrangements allow management of these businesses to require the Company to purchase their interests or allow the Company to acquire such interests at fair value, respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S3	These put and call arrangements become exercisable by the Company and the counter-party at various dates over the next four years.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S4	There are no put and call arrangements that became exercisable during 2012 and 2010.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S5	During 2011, one of these arrangements became exercisable.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S6	These put arrangements are exercisable by the counter-party outside the control of the Company.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S7	Accordingly, to the extent that the fair value of these interests exceeds the value determined by normal noncontrolling interest accounting, the value of such interests is adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
891103_13_ITEM8_P54_S8	During the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , the Company recorded adjustments of $4.3 million , $4.3 million and $(2.1) million , respectively, to increase (reduce) these interests to fair value.
891103_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the consolidated subsidiaries of the Company should ordinarily be reported on the consolidated balance sheet within shareholders' equity, separately from the Company's equity.
891103_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	However, securities that are redeemable at the option of the holder and not solely within the control of the issuer, must be classified outside of shareholders' equity.
891103_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	Accordingly, if redemption of the noncontrolling interests is outside the control of the Company, the interests are included outside of shareholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	Redeemable noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2012 and 2011 primarily relate to Meetic and certain operations included in the Media and Other segments.
891103_13_ITEM8_P55_S4	Redeemable noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2010 primarily relate to the international operations of Match and certain operations included in the Media and Other segments.
891103_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2012 and 2011 relate principally to Meetic.
891103_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Certain Risks and Concentrations A substantial portion of the Company's revenue is derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
891103_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	Significant changes in this industry or changes in advertising spending behavior or in customer buying behavior could adversely affect our operating results.
891103_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Most of the Company's online advertising revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Our services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google.
891103_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , revenue earned from Google is $1.4 billion , $970.4 million and $727.9 million , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	This revenue is earned by the businesses comprising the Search Applications segment.
891103_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	Accounts receivable related to revenue earned from Google totaled $125.3 million and $105.7 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Company's business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on third party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud.
891103_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
891103_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with financial institutions and are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
891103_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	NOTE 4 INCOME TAXES U.S. and foreign earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
891103_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes attributable to continuing operations are as follows:
891103_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	The current income tax payable was reduced by $57.1 million , $22.2 million and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, for excess tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation including settlements of vested stock-based awards denominated in subsidiaries' equity.
891103_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	The related income tax benefits are recorded as increases to additional paid-in capital.
891103_13_ITEM8_P63_S2	The tax effects of cumulative temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below.
891103_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	The valuation allowance is related to items for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Included in "Other current assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is a current deferred tax asset of $20.3 million and $41.0 million , respectively, and included in "Other non-current assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is a non-current deferred tax asset of $0.1 million and $1.4 million , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	In addition, included in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2011 is a current deferred tax liability of $0.4 million .
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	At December 31, 2012 , the Company has federal and state net operating losses ("NOLs") of $29.6 million and $92.1 million , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S3	If not utilized, the federal NOLs will expire at various times between 2023 and 2032, and the state NOLs will expire at various times between 2013 and 2032.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S4	Utilization of federal NOLs will be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S5	In addition, utilization of certain state NOLs may be subject to limitations under state laws similar to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S6	At December 31, 2012, the Company has foreign NOLs of $46.5 million available to offset future income.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S7	Of these foreign NOLs, $40.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $6.5 million will expire at various times between 2013 and 2032.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S8	During 2012, the Company recognized tax benefits related to NOLs of $2.1 million .
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S9	Included in this amount is $0.6 million of tax benefits of acquired attributes which was recorded as a reduction in goodwill.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S10	At December 31, 2012 , the Company has $8.9 million of federal capital losses and $248.4 million of state capital losses.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S11	If not utilized, the federal and state capital losses will expire between 2013 and 2017.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S12	Utilization of capital losses will be limited to the Company's ability to generate future capital gains.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S13	At December 31, 2012 , the Company has tax credit carryforwards of $14.9 million .
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S14	Of this amount, $4.6 million related to federal credits for foreign taxes, $8.8 million related to state tax credits for research activities, and $1.4 million related to various state and local tax credits.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S15	Of these credit carryforwards, $10.2 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $4.6 million will expire within ten years.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S16	During 2012 , the Company's valuation allowance increased by $15.7 million primarily due to an unbenefited other-than-temporary impairment and unrealized losses in long-term marketable equity securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income and an increase in federal net operating losses.
891103_13_ITEM8_P65_S17	At December 31, 2012 , the Company has a valuation allowance of $60.8 million related to the portion of tax loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	A reconciliation of the income tax provision (benefit) to the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is shown as follows:
891103_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	No income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $402.2 million at December 31, 2012 .
891103_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	The amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings is $93.3 million .
891103_13_ITEM8_P67_S2	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, is as follows:
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, are $496.8 million and $462.8 million , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 include $14.5 million that have been netted against the related deferred tax assets.
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	Of the remaining balance, $468.2 million is reflected in "non-current income taxes payable" and $ 14.1 million is reflected in "accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2012 .
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $34.0 million due principally to a net increase in deductible timing differences and additions for tax positions related to prior years.
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S4	Included in unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 is $75.7 million relating to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S5	If unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 are subsequently recognized, $110.8 million and $222.3 million , net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S6	If unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 are subsequently recognized, $ 89.5 million and $ 213.6 million , net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense from continuing operations and discontinued operations, respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S7	The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax provision.
891103_13_ITEM8_P68_S8	Included in the income tax provision for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 is a $5.2 million expense, $1.4 million expense and $9.1 million expense, respectively, net of related deferred taxes of $3.1 million , $0.9 million and $5.8 million , respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	provision for discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 is a $2.8 million benefit, $6.7 million expense and $7.0 million expense, respectively, net of related deferred taxes of $1.7 million , $4.2 million and $4.4 million , respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company has accrued $117.5 million and $111.2 million , respectively, for the payment of interest.
891103_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	Included in the income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 is a $0.4 million expense for an increase in penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_13_ITEM8_P69_S3	Included in income tax provision for continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 is a $2.5 million benefit for a reduction in penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_13_ITEM8_P69_S4	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company has accrued $5.0 million and $2.5 million , respectively, for penalties.
891103_13_ITEM8_P69_S5	The Company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax.
891103_13_ITEM8_P69_S6	These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions.
891103_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has substantially completed its audit of the Company's tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2001 through 2009.
891103_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	The settlement of these tax years has not yet been submitted to the Joint Committee of Taxation for approval.
891103_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	The statute of limitations for the years 2001 through 2009 has been extended to December 31, 2013, and we expect it to be extended further.
891103_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Various state and local jurisdictions are currently under examination, the most significant of which are California, New York and New York City for various tax years beginning with 2005.
891103_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	Income taxes payable include reserves considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns.
891103_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $122.2 million within twelve months of the current reporting date, of which approximately $13.4 million could decrease income tax provision, primarily due to settlements, expirations of statutes of limitations, and the reversal of deductible temporary differences that will primarily result in a corresponding decrease in net deferred tax assets.
891103_13_ITEM8_P73_S2	An estimate of other changes in unrecognized tax benefits, while potentially significant, cannot be made.
891103_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	NOTE 5 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Acquisition of About, Inc.
891103_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	On September 24, 2012, IAC completed its purchase of all the outstanding shares of About, Inc.
891103_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	( The About Group ), an online content and reference library offering expert, quality content across 90,000 topics.
891103_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	The purchase price was $300 million in cash, plus an amount equal to the net working capital of $17.1 million at closing.
891103_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	The financial results of The About Group are included in IAC's consolidated financial statements, within the Search Applications segment, beginning October 1, 2012.
891103_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company included $30.1 million of revenue and net earnings of $3.8 million in its consolidated statement of operations related to The About Group.
891103_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	The table below summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
891103_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The purchase price was based on the expected financial performance of The About Group, not on the value of the net identifiable assets at the time of acquisition, which resulted in a significant portion of the purchase price being attributed to goodwill.
891103_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	The expected financial performance of The About Group reflects that it is complementary and synergistic to the existing businesses of the Company's Search Applications segment, particularly Ask.com.
891103_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	The About Group's other current assets, property and equipment, other assets, current liabilities and other long-term liabilities were reviewed and adjusted to their fair values at the date of acquisition, as necessary.
891103_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	The fair value of trade names was determined using a relief from royalty method.
891103_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	The fair value of content was determined using an excess earnings method.
891103_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	The fair value of developed technology was determined using replacement cost.
891103_13_ITEM8_P80_S4	The fair value of advertiser relationships was determined using a "with and without" method, which determines the present value of profits that would be lost without the relationships.
891103_13_ITEM8_P80_S5	The fair value of customer lists was determined using an excess earnings method.
891103_13_ITEM8_P80_S6	The valuations of the intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require significant judgment and estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows and the determination of royalty and discount rates.
891103_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Substantially all of the amount attributed to goodwill is tax deductible.
891103_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Acquisition of Meetic In 2009, Match acquired a 27% ownership interest in Meetic.
891103_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	Match accounted for this interest under the equity method of accounting through August 31, 2011.
891103_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	During the third quarter of 2011, Match acquired an additional 12.5 million shares of Meetic for $272.0 million in cash pursuant to a tender offer.
891103_13_ITEM8_P82_S3	These additional shares increased Match's voting interest and ownership interest in Meetic to 79% and 81% , respectively, resulting in Match obtaining a controlling financial interest in Meetic.
891103_13_ITEM8_P82_S4	Accordingly, this purchase was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and the financial results of Meetic are included within IAC's consolidated financial statements and the Match operating segment beginning September 1, 2011.
891103_13_ITEM8_P82_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company included $46.1 million of revenue, net of a $32.6 million write-off of deferred revenue, and a net loss of $8.6 million in its consolidated statement of operations related to Meetic.

891103_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	NOTE 6 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Company also reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a definite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable.
891103_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	The Company performs its annual assessment for impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1 in connection with the preparation of its annual financial statements.
891103_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow ("DCF") analyses, and typically corroborates the concluded fair value using a market based valuation approach.
891103_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_13_ITEM8_P85_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 25% in 2012 and 13% to 20% in 2011.
891103_13_ITEM8_P85_S4	The Company determines the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using avoided royalty DCF analyses.
891103_13_ITEM8_P85_S5	Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10% to 18% in 2012 and 13% to 20% in 2011, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2012 and 2011.
891103_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	In connection with its annual assessment in 2010, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges at the Other segment related to the write-down of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of Shoebuy of $28.0 million and $4.5 million , respectively, and the write-down of an indefinite-lived intangible asset of Search Applications of $11.0 million .
891103_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at Shoebuy related to trade names and trademarks.
891103_13_ITEM8_P88_S2	The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges at Shoebuy reflected expectations of lower revenue and profit performance in future years due to Shoebuy's 2010 fourth quarter revenue and profit performance, which is its seasonally strongest quarter.
891103_13_ITEM8_P88_S3	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at Search Applications was primarily due to lower future revenue projections associated with a trade name and trademark based largely upon the impact of 2010's full year results.
891103_13_ITEM8_P88_S4	The indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are included in amortization of intangibles in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

891103_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	In the third quarter of 2011, the Company acquired a 20% interest in Zhenai Inc. ("Zhenai"), a leading provider of online matchmaking services in China.
891103_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Our voting power is limited by a shareholders agreement.
891103_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	In light of this limitation and the significance of our interest relative to other shareholders, we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial matters of Zhenai and this investment is accounted for as a cost method investment.
891103_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded a $7.8 million impairment charge related to the write-down of a cost method investment to fair value.
891103_13_ITEM8_P106_S1	The impairment charge was determined to be other-than-temporary due to the investee's inability to achieve its 2010 cash flow forecast during its seasonally strongest fourth quarter and the Company's assessment that the investee would be unable to continue to operate without new outside financing.
891103_13_ITEM8_P106_S2	The impairment charge is included in "Other (expense) income, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

891103_13_ITEM8_P107_S4	The Company recorded an $8.7 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to the security that was in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than one year, based on the Company's evaluation of the near-term prospects of the issuer in relation to the severity (fair value was 50 percent less than cost) and duration of the unrealized loss.
891103_13_ITEM8_P107_S5	The impairment charge is included in Other (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_13_ITEM8_P107_S6	The Company does not consider the second security to be other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2012 based on the Company's evaluation of the near term prospects of the issuer in relation to the severity and duration, less than two months, of the unrealized loss and the Company's ability and intent to hold this security for a reasonable period of time sufficient for an expected recovery of fair value.

891103_13_ITEM8_P142_S4	The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is reduced by estimated forfeitures, as the expense recorded is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
891103_13_ITEM8_P142_S5	The forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated rate.
891103_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 related to stock-based compensation is $31.3 million , $32.7 million and $32.2 million , respectively.

891103_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2012 :
891103_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2012.
891103_13_ITEM8_P146_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of IAC's common stock.
891103_13_ITEM8_P146_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 is $84.8 million , $70.6 million and $16.4 million , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
891103_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	Approximately 3.6 million , 2.6 million and 2.4 million stock options were granted by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_13_ITEM8_P148_S1	During 2012, 2011 and 2010, expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.
891103_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields for notes with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date.
891103_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
891103_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 with exercise prices equal to the market prices of IAC's common stock on the date of grant are $10.69 , $11.08 and $6.38 , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P151_S1	The weighted average exercise price and weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2010 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant are $ 60.00 and $ 7.61 , and $ 32.00 and $ 11.05 , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P151_S2	There are no stock options issued during the year ended December 31, 2011 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant.
891103_13_ITEM8_P151_S3	Cash received from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit realized for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 are: $58.2 million and $74.3 million ; $89.8 million and $25.5 million ; and $39.1 million and $8.6 million , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Stock Units RSUs and PSUs are awards in the form of phantom shares or units, denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of IAC common stock and with the value of each RSU and PSU equal to the fair value of IAC common stock at the date of grant.
891103_13_ITEM8_P152_S1	RSUs and PSUs may be settled in cash, stock or both, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
891103_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	Each RSU and PSU grant is subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests.
891103_13_ITEM8_P153_S1	PSUs also include performance-based vesting, where certain performance targets set at the time of grant must be achieved before an award vests.
891103_13_ITEM8_P153_S2	The Company recognizes expense for all RSUs and PSUs for which vesting is considered probable.
891103_13_ITEM8_P153_S3	For RSU grants, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_13_ITEM8_P153_S4	For PSU grants, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_13_ITEM8_P153_S5	Nonvested RSUs and PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2012 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2012 are as follows:
891103_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) Included in the table are PSUs which vest at the end of two or three years in varying amounts depending upon certain performance conditions.
891103_13_ITEM8_P154_S1	The PSU table above includes these awards at their maximum potential payout.
891103_13_ITEM8_P154_S2	The weighted average fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 based on market prices of IAC's common stock on the grant date was $46.24 , $32.41 and $23.05 , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P154_S3	The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $139.0 million , $33.2 million and $23.6 million , respectively.
891103_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	Equity Instruments Denominated in the Shares of Certain Subsidiaries IAC has granted phantom equity units and stock options in various operating subsidiaries to certain members of the subsidiaries' management.
891103_13_ITEM8_P155_S1	These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events.
891103_13_ITEM8_P155_S2	In some cases, IAC has taken a preferred interest in the subsidiary with a face value equal to the subsidiary's acquisition price or, when funding a start-up business, its investment cost, or a certain other fixed amount.
891103_13_ITEM8_P155_S3	In some cases, these preferred interests accrete with paid-in-kind dividends at a prescribed rate of return.
891103_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	The value of the phantom equity units and stock options is tied to the value of the common stock of the entity, with the equity awards management receives as a whole generally representing a small minority of the total common stock outstanding.
891103_13_ITEM8_P156_S1	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the preferred interest (including the accretion of dividends), our investment cost or other fixed amount or, in the case of stock options, the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_13_ITEM8_P156_S2	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_13_ITEM8_P156_S3	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock or cash at the option of IAC, with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration, at various dates through 2019.
891103_13_ITEM8_P156_S4	The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_13_ITEM8_P156_S5	The aggregate number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at December 31, 2012 is 2.0 million shares, which is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.
891103_13_ITEM8_P156_S6	The comparable amount at December 31, 2011 is 2.2 million shares.
891103_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker and executive management view the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of Other, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate operating segments.
891103_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) The Company's primary metric is Operating Income Before Amortization, which is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (3) goodwill impairment and (4) one-time items.
891103_13_ITEM8_P158_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it represents the operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which it believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation and acquisition related accounting.
891103_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-U.S. GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable U.S. GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-U.S. GAAP measure.
891103_13_ITEM8_P160_S1	(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.
891103_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	Revenue by geography is based on where the customer is located.
891103_13_ITEM8_P161_S1	Geographic information about revenue and long-lived assets is presented below:
891103_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	The following tables reconcile Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) for the Company's reportable segments:
891103_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	The following tables reconcile segment assets to total assets:

891103_13_ITEM8_P164_S1	NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with its operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses.
891103_13_ITEM8_P164_S2	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement.
891103_13_ITEM8_P164_S3	These operating expenses are not included in the table below.
891103_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	Future minimum payments under operating lease agreements are as follows:

891103_13_ITEM8_P168_S1	Purchase obligations also include minimum payments due under telecommunication contracts related to data transmission lines.
891103_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits.
891103_13_ITEM8_P169_S1	The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
891103_13_ITEM8_P169_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_13_ITEM8_P169_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_13_ITEM8_P169_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss.
891103_13_ITEM8_P169_S5	It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.

891103_14_ITEM1_P0_S4	All references to IAC, the Company, we, our or us in this report are to IAC/InterActiveCorp.
891103_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our History IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in July 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc.
891103_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and internet company.
891103_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	From 1997 through 2001, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group (and the remaining interest in 1998) and Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com), as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies.
891103_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	As its transformation from a hybrid media/electronic retailing company continued to evolve, in May 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Expedia.com and contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, or VUE, a joint venture then controlled by Vivendi.
891103_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	The Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire), in 2003.
891103_14_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. (now known as IAC Search Media, Inc.) and, on August 9, 2005, completed the separation of its travel and travel related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc. That year, IAC also sold its common and preferred interests in VUE to NBC Universal.
891103_14_ITEM1_P2_S3	In December 2006, the Company acquired Connected Ventures, LLC, which at that time owned and operated CollegeHumor.com and Vimeo.
891103_14_ITEM1_P2_S4	The Company transferred all of Vimeo s assets to a separate, wholly-owned subsidiary of IAC, Vimeo, LLC, in July 2008.
891103_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	In July 2008, the Company acquired the Lexico Publishing Group, owner of various reference websites, including Dictionary.com.
891103_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	On August 20, 2008, IAC separated into five publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster and Tree.com, Inc.
891103_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	In June 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic S.A. ("Meetic"), a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a 5 million note.
891103_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	In July 2009, we acquired PeopleMedia, Inc., operator of a number of demographically targeted dating websites.
891103_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	In December 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation's equity stake in IAC.
891103_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	In February 2011, we acquired OkCupid, an ad supported online personals service.
891103_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	During the third quarter of 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%.
891103_14_ITEM1_P4_S5	In September 2012, we acquired The About Group, which primarily consists of About.com, a comprehensive online content and reference library.
891103_14_ITEM1_P4_S6	In December 2012, we acquired Tutor, an online tutoring service.
891103_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	In early 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic for approximately $72 million through a successful tender offer in France and the businesses within ValueClick s Owned and Operated reporting segment, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, for $80 million.
891103_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis.
891103_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	As of January 31, 2014, Barry Diller, IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive, owned 5,789,499 shares of Class B common stock (the "Diller Shares") representing 100% of IAC's outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 43.1% of the outstanding total voting power of IAC.
891103_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	Pursuant to an agreement between Mr. Diller and IAC, certain transfer restrictions apply to 1.5 million of the Diller Shares, including a requirement that, until December 1, 2015 and except for transfers to certain permitted transferees, the Diller Shares must first be converted into common stock in order to be transferred.
891103_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC's ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
891103_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller's ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller is currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC's Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	DESCRIPTION OF IAC BUSINESSES Search Applications Overview Our Search Applications segment consists of:
891103_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Applications, including our direct to consumer downloadable applications operations ( B2C ) and our partnership operations ( B2B ).
891103_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our Websites and Applications businesses provide search services to our users.
891103_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	These search services generally involve the generation and display of a set of hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users.
891103_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries.
891103_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to an advertiser's website.
891103_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by the advertiser.
891103_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	The paid listings we display are supplied to us by Google Inc.
891103_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	( Google ) pursuant to a services agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Websites Our Websites business, through which we provide search, content and other services, primarily consists of the following destination websites:
891103_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Citysearch.com, InsiderPages.com and Urbanspoon.com, through which consumers can access local merchant information and reviews online.
891103_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our Websites business also includes the results of CityGrid, an advertising network that integrates local content and advertising for distribution to both affiliated and third party publishers across web and mobile platforms.
891103_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our B2C operations develop, market and distribute a variety of downloadable applications that offer users the ability to access search services, as well as engage in a number of other activities online, such as play games, send e-cards, decorate e-mails and web pages and explore select vertical categories.
891103_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	The majority of our B2C applications are toolbars, which consist of a browser search box and related technology (which together enable users to run search queries and otherwise access search services directly from their web browsers).
891103_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	Many of our toolbars are coupled with other applications that we have developed that enable users to personalize their online activities and otherwise make them more expressive and fun.
891103_14_ITEM1_P14_S3	These applications include: MyFunCards, through which users can send online greeting cards; Popular Screensavers, through which users can personalize their desktops with photos, images and animations; and Retrogamer and Gaming Wonderland, through which users can access classic arcade, sports and action and other casual games directly from their web browsers.
891103_14_ITEM1_P14_S4	Other B2C applications target users with a special or passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as television programming, sports, shopping and gossip, among others) or provide users with particular reference information or access to specific utilities (such as maps, weather forecasts or file conversion technology).
891103_14_ITEM1_P14_S5	These applications include: Television Fanatic, through which users can browse and search for scheduling information, episode synopses and actor profiles for television shows, as well as directly access online episodes via media players and links to related third party services; TotalRecipeSearch, through which users can access thousands of recipes and cooking tips; Allin1Convert, through which users can convert files from one type of format into another type of format, and Coupon Alert, through which users can access coupons and online promotions.
891103_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	We distribute our B2C applications directly to consumers free of charge.
891103_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our B2B operations work closely with partners in the software, media and other industries to design and develop customized browser based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners' products and services.
891103_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	We also market and distribute a number of mobile applications through which we provide search and additional services, including: the Ask.com iOS and Android applications, which provide general search and natural language question and answer services, and the Dictionary.com iOS and Android applications, which provide dictionary, reference, educational and learning services.
891103_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Search Applications segment s revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, as well as from advertisements appearing on its destination search websites and portals and certain third party websites and the syndication of search results generated by Ask-branded destination search websites.
891103_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	The substantial majority of the paid listings we display are supplied to us by Google pursuant to our services agreement with Google.
891103_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, we transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to us for display in search results.
891103_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages.
891103_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	When a user submits a search query through our Search Applications properties and services and clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of its related paid listing fee with us.
891103_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	In cases where the user s click is generated by a third party website, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share obligation to the third party website as traffic acquisition costs.
891103_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	To a lesser extent, we also syndicate Google paid listings through third parties with whom we enter into syndication agreements.
891103_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	See Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Competition We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to: (i) attract users to our various Search Applications properties and services generally; (ii) develop, market and distribute our Applications; (iii) attract third parties to distribute our Applications and related technology; and (iv) attract advertisers.
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	In the case of our search services generally, our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications), third party toolbar, convenience search and applications providers, other search technology and convenience service providers (including internet access providers, social media platforms, online advertising networks, traditional media companies and companies that provide online content).
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	When we market our search and content services, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results.
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	Moreover, some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S5	In the case of our Websites business, we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the relevance and authority of our search results, answers and other content, the functionality of our various websites, the quality of related content and features and the attractiveness of the services provided by our websites generally to consumers relative to those of our competitors.
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S6	We believe that we differentiate Ask.com from its competitors through question and answer services that provide accurate, authoritative and direct answers to natural language questions (in the form of algorithmic search results and/or responses from other Ask.com users, as well as indexed question and answer pairings from various websites and online services).
891103_14_ITEM1_P21_S7	Our ability to continue to differentiate Ask.com from its competitors in this manner depends primarily upon our ability to deliver authoritative and trustworthy content to users, as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative.
891103_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	toolbars and access to multiple search and other services through our toolbars), secure cost-effective distribution arrangements with third parties and market and distribute our toolbars and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner.

891103_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	The personals business is very competitive and highly fragmented and barriers to entry are minimal.
891103_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	We compete primarily with online and offline broad based personals, dating and matchmaking services (both paid and free), social media platforms and applications, the personals sections of newspapers and magazines, other conventional media companies that provide personals services and traditional venues where singles meet (both online and offline).

891103_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	how quickly we can enhance our existing technology and services and/or develop new features and services in response to:
891103_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	the recognition and strength of our various brands relative to those of our competitors.

891103_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	When a consumer submits a request through the HomeAdvisor marketplace, we generally match that consumer with up to four home services professionals from our network based on the type of services desired and the consumer's location.
891103_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	Consumers can then review home services professional profiles and select the professional that they believe best meets their specific needs.
891103_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	In all cases, if a match is made, the consumer is under no obligation to work with home service professionals referred by HomeAdvisor.
891103_14_ITEM1_P33_S4	In addition to our matching services, consumers may also access our CostGuide, which provides project cost information for more than 250 project types on a local basis, and our online library of service related resources, which primarily includes articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with home services professionals.

891103_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	In 2013, HomeAdvisor introduced three new subscription offerings for home services professionals, each for a flat monthly fee.
891103_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	The basic membership package includes membership in the HomeAdvisor network, as well the inclusion of the home services professional s contact information in HomeAdvisor s online directory, which is posted on www.homeadvisor.com and affiliated websites.
891103_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	selecting those home services professionals they wish to work with (in lieu of HomeAdvisor providing matches) and contacting such professionals directly.
891103_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	The two additional membership packages include all of the basic membership package services, plus matches through the HomeAdvisor marketplace and, in the case of one package, custom website and mobile development and hosting services as well.
891103_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Since October 2013, HomeAdvisor has been marketing its subscription packages to existing home services professionals within its network and in the case of home services professionals who are new to HomeAdvisor , these professionals must sign up for one of the subscription offerings described above (versus being able to join the network for free and only pay for matches, which was the case prior to October 2013).
891103_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2013, approximately 15,000 of the more than 80,000 home services professionals within the HomeAdvisor network had purchased a membership package.
891103_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Marketing We market our services to consumers primarily through search engine marketing, as well as through affiliate agreements with third parties.
891103_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and those of our home services professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website (on a cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to our website (on a cost-per-click basis).
891103_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	We also market our services to consumers through the purchase of paid listings displayed in yellow page directories, portals and contextual home improvement related sites and, to a lesser extent, through traditional offline advertising, including television.
891103_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	We market our subscription packages to home services professionals through our sales force, as well as online through search engine marketing, relationships with trade associations and affiliate marketing relationships.
891103_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	Revenue HomeAdvisor's revenue is derived primarily from fees paid by members of our network of home services professionals for matches with consumers made by HomeAdvisor (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service), as well as from subscription fees for our new home services professional subscription offerings, fees for website hosting services and fees charged upon the enrollment and activation of new home services professionals in our network.
891103_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Fees for matches vary based upon the service requested and where the service is provided.
891103_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	Competition We currently compete with home services-related lead generation services, as well as internet search engines and directories and with other forms of local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories.
891103_14_ITEM1_P41_S2	We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services.
891103_14_ITEM1_P41_S3	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	our ability to build and maintain awareness of, and loyalty to, the HomeAdvisor brand among consumers.
891103_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Media Our Media segment consists primarily of Vimeo, Electus, DailyBurn and The Daily Beast.

891103_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2013, IAC and its subsidiaries employed approximately 4,000 full-time employees.
891103_14_ITEM1_P54_S1	IAC believes that it generally has good employee relationships, including relationships with employees represented by unions or other similar organizations.
891103_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Additional Information Company Website and Public Filings.
891103_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	The Company maintains a website at www.iac.com.
891103_14_ITEM1_P55_S2	Neither the information on the Company's website, nor the information on the website of any IAC business, is incorporated by reference in this annual report, or in any other filings with, or in any other information furnished or submitted to, the SEC.
891103_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Company makes available, free of charge through its website, its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (including related amendments) as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with (or furnished to) the SEC.
891103_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	The Company's code of ethics, as amended in April 2009, applies to all employees (including all of IAC's executive officers and senior financial officers (including IAC's Chief Financial Officer and Controller)) and directors and is posted on the Company's website at http://ir.iac.com/corporate-governance-document.cfm?DocumentID=11373.
891103_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	This code of ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC Regulation S-K and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market.
891103_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	Any changes to the code of ethics that affect the provisions required by Item 406 of Regulation S-K, and any waivers of such provisions of the code of ethics for IAC's executive officers, senior financial officers or directors, will also be disclosed on IAC's website.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The use of words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, plans and believes, among others, generally identify forward looking statements.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These forward looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC's future financial performance, IAC's business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which IAC's businesses operate and other similar matters.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These forward looking statements are based on IAC management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the risk factors set forth below.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC's business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	IAC does not undertake to update these forward looking statements.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Risk Factors Mr. Diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S9	As of January 31, 2014, Mr. Diller owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock representing 100% of IAC s outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 43.1% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S10	As of this date, Mr. Diller also owned 855,734 vested options to purchase IAC common stock and 150,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S11	In addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC s Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve month period.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P1_S12	While Mr. Diller may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case IAC would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller s ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller currently is in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Search Applications properties.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P3_S7	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search related services.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to the advertiser) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Search Applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes to Google s paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings from our Search Applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our services agreement with Google requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its brands and services, including the manner in which Google s paid listings are displayed within search results, and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Noncompliance with Google s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could, if not cured, result in Google s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners, the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by Google.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of IAC s rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	General economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S7	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the internet.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies enter the online advertising market.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting and/or utilize mobile devices), the continued growth in commercial use of the internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	principles that required additional disclosure and/or opt-in policies for advertising that incorporates user targeting or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We depend, in part, upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products and services.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	How successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	For example, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to distribute Search Applications search boxes, toolbars and other applications to users through third parties.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Most of these agreements are either non exclusive and short term in nature or, in the case of long term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our B2B applications.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Our inability to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute our search boxes, toolbars and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in website traffic, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S8	In addition, in the case of the businesses within our Match segment, we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Pursuant to these arrangements, third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through e-mail campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to (or register with) our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S10	These arrangements are generally not exclusive, are short term in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P8_S11	If existing arrangements with third parties are terminated (or are not renewed upon their expiration) and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues, or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing and/or new third parties in response to industry trends, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In the case of our HomeAdvisor business, our ability to drive traffic depends, in part, on the nature and number of home services professionals who are members of our network.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	While these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long term agreements with them generally and subscription memberships may be canceled at any time.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	In addition, a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	As a result, our network of home services professionals experiences turnover from time to time.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	This turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to HomeAdvisor.com and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties, we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S6	For example, in the case of About.com, we rely on independent, freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content for our users.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S7	If we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally and/or the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in a cost-effective manner, the experience of our users would be adversely affected, which would result in a decrease in users and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S8	In addition, we may not be able to adapt quickly and/or in cost-effective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements and/or new products or services to the market.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P9_S9	Our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users, customers and revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As discussed below, our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing, as well as for the development and introduction of new products, services and enhancements, infrastructure and other related efforts.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	offline advertising in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In the case of our search engine marketing efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may be unilaterally updated by Google), could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the related user experience, as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally, which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In the case of paid advertising generally, the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	One of the most cost-effective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	SEO involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of user searches.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The failure to successfully manage SEO efforts across our businesses, including the timely modification of SEO efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, search engines have increasingly expanded their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and have in certain instances displayed their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search engine results.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Lastly, as discussed above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any failure to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and enhance our various brands.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of highly-recognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We believe that our success depends, in part, upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance these brands.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Moreover, the failure to market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact our various brands, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P15_S12	The internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the internet, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, requires significant time and resources.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-effective manner) to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately (and/or in a cost effective manner) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies and applications (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, there are technologies and applications that interfere with the functionality of (or settings changes made by) our applications.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	For example, there are technologies and applications that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	These technologies, applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications, which in turn adversely impacts our revenues.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to opt out of our advertising products.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other applications in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies and applications could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our success also depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S7	While most of our users currently access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S8	While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services and intend to continue to do so in the future, we have limited experience with mobile applications, both in terms of development and monetization.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S9	Moreover, mobile versions of our products and services that we develop may not be compelling to users and/advertisers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S10	Even if we are able to develop mobile applications that resonate with users and advertisers, the success of these applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Lastly, as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread, the usage of certain of our products and services may not translate to mobile devices, which shift could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including credit card data) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data (for example, various state regulations concerning minimum data security standards, industry self-regulating principles that become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections regarding privacy and data security (and related compliance obligations)).
891103_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy, it could become subject to an investigation and proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act (and/or brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law), as well as a private lawsuit under various U.S. federal and state laws.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In general, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	U.S. legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In February 2012, the White House released a proposed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, which is intended to serve as a framework for new privacy legislation.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In March 2012, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission released a staff report making recommendations for businesses and policy makers in the area of consumer privacy.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Similarly, new privacy laws and regulations at the state level, as well as new laws and directives abroad (particularly in Europe), are being proposed and implemented.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	For example, new legislation in the state of California that became effective on January 1, 2014 requires companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, existing privacy laws that were intended for brick-and-mortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P21_S6	New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws) in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses and/or limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities, such as targeted advertising, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data, credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Moreover, any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally, which would decrease traffic to (and in turn, usage and transactions on) the relevant website and/or our various websites and which in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies, federal, state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or PCI standards and/or the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S7	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S8	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S9	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S10	As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S11	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P23_S12	Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	successfully manage acquisition related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S7	For example, we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, including issues associated with the establishment of management systems and infrastructures (including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), the staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject us to claims or other remedies.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S5	For example, through our various businesses we post and link to third party content, including third party advertisements, links and websites.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S6	We also allow users to submit content, such as comments, photographs and videos.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S7	We could be subject to liability for posting, hosting or linking to third party content, and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims, we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Some laws, including the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S9	For example, the DMCA generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user, so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S10	However, the scope and applicability of the DMCA are subject to judicial interpretation and, as such, remain uncertain, and the U.S. Congress may enact legislation affecting (and potentially limiting) the protections afforded by the DMCA to online service providers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Moreover, similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S12	As a result, claims have been, and could be, threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting, among other things, negligence, defamation, invasion of privacy or right or publicity, copyright infringement or trademark infringement.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S13	In addition, changing internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S14	One example of such changing practices is the advent of so-called native advertising, a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P27_S15	The U.S. Federal Trade Commission recently indicated that it will be monitoring the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other similar intellectual property, as critical to our success.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	For example, the businesses within our principal reporting segments (Search Applications, Match and Local) rely heavily upon their trademarks (primarily Ask.com, About.com, Dictionary.com, our various toolbar brands, Match.com, OkCupid.com, OurTime.com, Meetic.com and HomeAdvisor.com and related domain names and logos), through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	So long as these businesses continue to use these trademarks to identify their products and services and renew trademark registrations as required, they will continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws, rules and regulations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The businesses within our Search Applications segment also rely upon trade secrets, including algorithms for the generation, organization and presentation of search results.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	To a lesser extent, these businesses also rely upon patented and patent pending proprietary technologies and processes, primarily those relating to search related products and services, with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2033, and copyrighted material, primarily emoticons, characters and other content that is incorporated into (and used in connection with the marketing of) toolbars generally.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our Match segment also relies upon trade secrets and certain patent pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features, products and services.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	HomeAdvisor relies heavily upon trade secrets, primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of home services professionals are matched with consumers, as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S6	No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S7	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P31_S9	The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	To succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services, which could adversely affect our business.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	and online properties increases and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we fail to do so, users, customers and third parties with whom we do business may not be able to access our products and services on an intermittent or prolonged basis, which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, we could experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, which could have the same effect.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Moreover, even if we do not encounter any inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business may not make the changes to their systems, infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis, if at all.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Furthermore, data security breaches (as a result of actions taken by hackers or otherwise), fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S9	While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S10	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S11	In particular, our destination search websites may be adversely affected by fraudulent, surreptitious or other unwanted computer programs, applications and activity that make changes to users' computers and interfere with the overall experience of our products and services, such as by hijacking queries to these websites or altering or replacing search results generated.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S12	This type of interference often occurs without disclosure to (or consent from) users, resulting in a negative experience that users may associate with us.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S13	These disruptive programs and applications may be difficult or impossible to uninstall or disable, may reinstall themselves and may circumvent efforts to block or remove them.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S14	In addition, downloadable applications through which we provide search services are also subject to attack by viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, which could jeopardize the security of information stored in users' computers or in our systems and networks.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S15	No assurances can be given that our efforts to combat these malicious applications will be successful and/or that our products and services will not have (or will not be perceived to have) vulnerabilities in this regard.
891103_14_ITEM1A_P34_S16	If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.

891103_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We market and offer our products and services directly to consumers through branded websites and subscriptions, allowing consumers to transact directly with us in a convenient manner.
891103_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising to build our brands and drive traffic to our websites and consumers and advertisers to our businesses.
891103_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	We pay traffic acquisition costs, which consist of payments to partners who distribute our B2B customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites.
891103_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	We also pay to market and distribute our services on third party distribution channels, such as internet portals and search engines.
891103_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	In addition, some of our businesses manage affiliate programs, pursuant to which we pay commissions and fees to third parties based on revenue earned.
891103_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	These distribution channels might also offer their own products and services, as well as those of other third parties, which compete with those we offer.
891103_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The cost of acquiring new consumers through online and offline third party distribution channels has increased, particularly in the case of online channels as internet commerce continues to grow and competition in the markets in which IAC's businesses operate increases.
891103_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Factors Affecting Results In 2013, we delivered 8% revenue growth, 21% Operating Income Before Amortization growth and 32% Operating Income growth.
891103_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Results were primarily driven by our Search Applications and Match segments.
891103_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	The results of our Search Applications segment benefited from a full year contribution from The About Group, which was acquired on September 24, 2012; and CityGrid Media, which has been moved from the Local segment to the Search Applications segment, effective July 1, 2013, following its reorganization.
891103_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	The results at our Match segment benefited from increased subscribers; which is due, in part, to recent acquisitions, the most significant being Twoo, which was acquired on January 4, 2013.
891103_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	Other events affecting year-over-year comparability are (i) the closure of the Newsweek print business and subsequent sale of Newsweek in August 2013 (reflected in the Media segment); (ii) the sale of the Rezbook assets in July 2013 (reflected in the Local segment); and (iii) the acquisition of Tutor.com, acquired December 14, 2012 (reflected in the Other segment).

891103_14_ITEM7_P5_S7	Developing revenue further benefited from the contribution of Twoo, which was acquired January 4, 2013.
891103_14_ITEM7_P5_S8	Local revenue decreased 14% to $ 277.5 million due to the move of CityGrid Media from the Local segment to the Search Applications segment, effective July 1, 2013, following its reorganization, and a decline at HomeAdvisor.
891103_14_ITEM7_P5_S9	Partially offsetting these declines is the contribution from Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service acquired August 20, 2012.
891103_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	HomeAdvisor domestic revenue was negatively impacted by an 11% decrease in accepted service requests due primarily to its domain name change at the end of 2012.

891103_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	Match revenue increased 38% to $ 713.4 million benefiting from the full year contribution of Meetic, which was consolidated beginning September 1, 2011, and growth within our Core operations, partially offset by a decrease in Developing revenue.

891103_14_ITEM7_P6_S10	Developing revenue decreased 9% to $66.9 million, despite strong growth from OkCupid, due to lower subscription revenue from our Latin America venture and Singlesnet.

891103_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Local revenue increased 6% to $ 322.6 million , primarily reflecting growth from HomeAdvisor's operations.
891103_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	HomeAdvisor domestic revenue grew due to higher average lead acceptance fees.

891103_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	Local revenue further benefited from the contribution of Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service acquired August 20, 2012, and higher reseller revenue from CityGrid Media, partially offset by a decline in direct sales revenue.
891103_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	Media revenue increased 135% to $ 164.8 million primarily due to the contribution from News_Beast, consolidated beginning June 1, 2012 following the Company's acquisition of a controlling interest, as well as strong growth from Electus and Vimeo.

891103_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	At December 31, 2013, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
891103_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations.

891103_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	IAC'S PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING IAC reports Operating Income Before Amortization as a supplemental measure to generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_14_ITEM7_P50_S5	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
891103_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Definition of IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Operating Income Before Amortization is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (3) goodwill impairment, (4) acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and (5) one-time items.
891103_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	We believe this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation and acquisition-related accounting.
891103_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	One-Time Items Operating Income Before Amortization is presented before one-time items, if applicable.
891103_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	These items are truly one-time in nature and non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
891103_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	For the periods presented in this report, there are no adjustments for one-time items.
891103_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Non-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based RSUs.
891103_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding which, for stock options and RSUs, are included on a treasury method basis, and for performance-based RSUs are included on a treasury method basis once the performance conditions are met.
891103_14_ITEM7_P53_S2	Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Amortization of intangibles (including impairment of intangibles, if applicable) and goodwill impairment (if applicable) are non-cash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions.
891103_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	While it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments are accounting adjustments to record contingent consideration liabilities at fair value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING INCOME BEFORE AMORTIZATION For a reconciliation of Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
891103_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
891103_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	The annual assessments identified no impairment charges in 2013, 2012 or 2011.
891103_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	The value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $ 1.7 billion and $376.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013.
891103_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	In 2012, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-08, "Testing Goodwill for Impairment," which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a two-step process.
891103_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow ("DCF") analysis.
891103_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 25% in both 2013 and 2012.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S4	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S5	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S6	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S7	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
891103_14_ITEM7_P64_S8	In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid.
891103_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	At October 1, 2013, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of six of the Company's eight reporting units significantly exceed their carrying values, and the fair value of Tutor and Felix, both of which were acquired in 2012, approximates their carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	Any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	The primary driver in the DCF valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability.
891103_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Generally, the Company would expect to record an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	This assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	In 2012, the Company adopted ASU 2012-02, "Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment," which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	The estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10% to 18% in both 2013 and 2012, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2013 and 2012.
891103_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_14_ITEM7_P71_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	During 2013 and 2011 the Company wrote off certain capitalized software costs.
891103_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $363.0 million at December 31, 2013.
891103_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Income Taxes Estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, and reflect management's assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization.
891103_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $286.6 million.
891103_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process.
891103_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured for purposes of financial statement recognition as the largest amount of benefit which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $408.8 million, including interest.
891103_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	Stock-Based Compensation As disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2013, 2012 and 2011 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 1.0%, 0.6% and 2.3%, respectively, a dividend yield of 2.0%, 1.2% and zero, respectively, volatility factors of 29%, 31% and 30%, respectively, based on the historical stock price volatilities of IAC and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 6.2 years, 4.4 years and 6.1 years, respectively.
891103_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	For stock options, including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date (or acquisition date, if applicable) at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term.
891103_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	The impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2013, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor, and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $2.0 million, $9.2 million, and $3.9 million, respectively.
891103_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs.
891103_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	For RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation expense over the vesting term.
891103_14_ITEM7_P81_S2	For performance-based RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Marketable Securities and Long-term Investments Marketable securities consist of equity securities and a short-to-medium-term debt security issued by an investment grade corporate issuer.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	Long-term investments include equity securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods and marketable equity securities.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S2	The Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S3	The Company also invests in marketable equity securities as part of its investment strategy.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S4	Marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S5	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S6	The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S7	Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S8	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S9	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S10	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S11	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash and the investee company's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve business plan; the need for changes to the investee company's existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_14_ITEM7_P82_S12	During 2013, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $5.0 million related to a cost method investment and during 2012, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $8.7 million related to one of its long-term marketable equity securities.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and long-term debt.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which consist of money market funds and a short-to-medium-term debt security issued by an investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S3	During 2013, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 2013, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by less than $0.1 million.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S5	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S6	Conversely, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of $ 1.1 billion is invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S7	At December 31, 2013, the Company's outstanding debt is $1.1 billion , all of which pays interest at fixed rates.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S8	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S9	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $67.5 million.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P2_S10	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2013, the Company has three investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	These available-for-sale marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on their quoted market prices with any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, included as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	During 2013, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its available-for-sale marketable equity securities.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	During 2012, the Company recorded an $8.7 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to one of its available-for-sale marketable equity securities.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The other-than-temporary impairment charge is included in "Other income (expense), net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	However, the exposure is mitigated since the Company has generally reinvested cash flows from international operations in order to grow the businesses.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The statements of operations of the Company's international businesses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in reduced revenue and operating results.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Similarly, the Company's revenue and operating results will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the Company is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P6_S5	These changes, if material, could cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are not material to the Company's earnings in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exchange risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P9_S1	However, the Company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency exchange risks.
891103_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Company's objective in managing its foreign currency exchange risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that foreign currency exchange rates might have on its earnings, cash flows and financial position.

891103_14_ITEM8_P18_S3	The Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_14_ITEM8_P18_S4	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash and the investee company's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee company's existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_14_ITEM8_P18_S5	If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.

891103_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_14_ITEM8_P32_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_14_ITEM8_P32_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves.
891103_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
891103_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.
891103_14_ITEM8_P33_S3	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
891103_14_ITEM8_P33_S4	The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments.
891103_14_ITEM8_P33_S5	The amount of these reserves are based, in part, on historical experience.
891103_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including significant improvements, are recorded at cost.
891103_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
891103_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Company capitalizes certain internal use software costs including external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the software and compensation and other employee-related costs for personnel directly associated with the development of the software.
891103_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
891103_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	During the second quarter of 2013, the Company wrote off $2.7 million in capitalized software costs at The About Group primarily related to projects that commenced prior to its acquisition.
891103_14_ITEM8_P36_S3	During 2011, the Company wrote off $4.9 million in capitalized software costs associated with the exit of the Company's direct sponsored listings business.
891103_14_ITEM8_P36_S4	The net book value of capitalized internal use software is $30.9 million and $33.4 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that are expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	In 2012, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-08, "Testing Goodwill for Impairment", which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM8_P37_S3	If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise, the fair value of the reporting unit has to be determined and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_14_ITEM8_P37_S4	The Company also adopted Accounting Standards Update 2012-02 "Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment" in 2012, which gives companies the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM8_P37_S5	If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined; otherwise, the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset has to be determined and if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow ("DCF") analyses, and typically corroborates the concluded fair value using a market based valuation approach.
891103_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on each reporting unit's current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_14_ITEM8_P39_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 25% in both 2013 and 2012 .
891103_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using avoided royalty DCF analyses.
891103_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10% to 18% in both 2013 and 2012 , and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2013 and 2012 .
891103_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Company's reporting units are consistent with its determination of its operating segments.
891103_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
891103_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Media and Other include other operating segments that do not have goodwill.
891103_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	See Note 15 for additional information regarding the Company's method of determining operating and reportable segments.
891103_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	There were no material impairment charges recorded in 2013 , 2012 or 2011 .
891103_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	At October 1, 2013, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of six of the Company's eight reporting units significantly exceed their carrying values, and the fair value of Tutor and Felix, both of which were acquired in 2012, approximates their carrying value.
891103_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Definite Lives Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is computed either on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset will be realized.
891103_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_14_ITEM8_P48_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	Level 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	The fair value of the Company's Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.
891103_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used.
891103_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
891103_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	See Note 9 for a discussion of fair value measurements made using Level 3 inputs.
891103_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity and cost method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.
891103_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.
891103_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Traffic Acquisition Costs Traffic acquisition costs consist of payments made to partners who distribute our B2B customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites.
891103_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements.
891103_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company expenses these payments as a component of cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred (when the advertisement first runs for production costs that are initially capitalized) and represent online marketing, including fees paid to search engines and third parties that distribute our B2C downloadable applications, and offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising.
891103_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	Advertising expense is $828.8 million , $774.1 million and $499.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company capitalizes and amortizes the costs associated with certain distribution arrangements that require it to pay a fee per access point delivered.
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	These access points are generally in the form of downloadable applications associated with our B2C operations.
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	These fees are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent the Company can reasonably estimate a probable future economic benefit and the period over which such benefit will be realized (generally 18 months).
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S3	Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred.
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S4	Legal Costs Legal costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S5	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S6	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_14_ITEM8_P55_S7	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company records interest, net of any applicable related income tax benefit, on potential income tax contingencies as a component of income tax expense.
891103_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
891103_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	Basic earnings per share ("Basic EPS") is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
891103_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Diluted earnings per share ("Diluted EPS") reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vested resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
891103_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	The financial position and operating results of substantially all foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency.
891103_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	Local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
891103_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity.
891103_14_ITEM8_P59_S3	Transaction gains and losses resulting from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of other income (expense), net.
891103_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Translation gains and losses relating to foreign entities that are liquidated or substantially liquidated are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	Such gains totaled $9.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011, and are included in "Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the requisite service period.
891103_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	See Note 14 for a further description of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	In connection with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries, management of these businesses has retained an ownership interest.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company is party to fair value put and call arrangements with respect to these interests.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	These put and call arrangements allow management of these businesses to require the Company to purchase their interests or allow the Company to acquire such interests at fair value, respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S3	The put arrangements do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument as the put agreements do not provide for net settlement.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S4	These put and call arrangements become exercisable by the Company and the counter-party at various dates over the next two years.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S5	During 2013, two of these arrangements became exercisable.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S6	There are no put and call arrangements that became exercisable during 2012.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S7	During 2011, one of these arrangements became exercisable.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S8	These put arrangements are exercisable by the counter-party outside the control of the Company.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S9	Accordingly, to the extent that the fair value of these interests exceeds the value determined by normal noncontrolling interest accounting, the value of such interests is adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
891103_14_ITEM8_P62_S10	During the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , the Company recorded adjustments of $40.6 million , $4.3 million and $4.3 million , respectively, to increase these interests to fair value.
891103_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Fair value determinations require high levels of judgment and are based on various valuation techniques, including market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.
891103_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the consolidated subsidiaries of the Company should ordinarily be reported on the consolidated balance sheet within shareholders' equity, separately from the Company's equity.
891103_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	However, securities that are redeemable at the option of the holder and not solely within the control of the issuer must be classified outside of shareholders' equity.
891103_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	Accordingly, if redemption of the noncontrolling interests is outside the control of the Company, the interests are included outside of shareholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	Redeemable noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2013 and 2012 relate to certain operations included in the Match, Media and Other segments.
891103_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2013 and 2012 relate principally to Meetic.
891103_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Certain Risks and Concentrations A substantial portion of the Company's revenue is derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
891103_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	Significant changes in this industry or changes in advertising spending behavior or in customer buying behavior could adversely affect our operating results.
891103_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Most of the Company's online advertising revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	Our services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google.
891103_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , revenue earned from Google is $1.5 billion , $1.4 billion and $970.4 million , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	This revenue is earned by the businesses comprising the Search Applications segment.
891103_14_ITEM8_P68_S2	Accounts receivable related to revenue earned from Google totaled $112.3 million and $125.3 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Company's business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on third party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud.
891103_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
891103_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with financial institutions and are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
891103_14_ITEM8_P69_S3	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
891103_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	NOTE 4 INCOME TAXES U.S. and foreign earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
891103_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes attributable to continuing operations are as follows:

891103_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	The related income tax benefits are recorded as increases to additional paid-in capital.
891103_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Income taxes (payable) receivable and deferred tax (liabilities) assets are included in the following captions in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
891103_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	The tax effects of cumulative temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below.
891103_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The valuation allowance is related to deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the Company has federal and state net operating losses ("NOLs") of $54.9 million and $77.2 million , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	If not utilized, the federal NOLs will expire at various times between 2023 and 2033, and the state NOLs will expire at various times between 2014 and 2033.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	Utilization of federal NOLs will be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	In addition, utilization of certain state NOLs may be subject to limitations under state laws similar to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S4	At December 31, 2013 , the Company has foreign NOLs of $98.2 million available to offset future income.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S5	Of these foreign NOLs, $93.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $5.2 million will expire at various times between 2014 and 2033.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S6	During 2013, the Company recognized tax benefits related to NOLs of $10.6 million .
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S7	Included in this amount is $10.4 million of tax benefits of acquired attributes, which was recorded as a reduction in goodwill.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S8	At December 31, 2013 , the Company has $34.4 million of state capital losses.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S9	If not utilized, the federal and state capital losses will expire between 2014 and 2017.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S10	Utilization of capital losses will be limited to the Company's ability to generate future capital gains.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S11	At December 31, 2013 , the Company has tax credit carryforwards of $11.9 million .
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S12	Of this amount, $5.5 million relates to federal credits for foreign taxes, $5.2 million relates to state tax credits for research activities, and $1.2 million relates to various state and local tax credits.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S13	Of these credit carryforwards, $6.4 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $5.5 million will expire within ten years.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S14	During 2013 , the Company's valuation allowance increased by $1.6 million primarily due to an increase in foreign net operating losses, partially offset by realized gains in long-term marketable equity securities.
891103_14_ITEM8_P76_S15	At December 31, 2013 , the Company has a valuation allowance of $62.4 million related to the portion of tax loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	A reconciliation of the income tax provision (benefit) to the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is shown as follows:
891103_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	No income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $517.4 million at December 31, 2013 .
891103_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	The amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings is $119.5 million .
891103_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, is as follows:
891103_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax provision.
891103_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	Included in the income tax provision for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 is a $4.8 million expense, $5.2 million expense and $1.4 million expense, respectively, net of related deferred taxes of $2.8 million , $3.1 million and $0.9 million , respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_14_ITEM8_P80_S2	Included in income tax provision for discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 is a $1.4 million expense, $2.8 million benefit and $6.7 million expense, respectively, net of related deferred taxes of $0.8 million , $1.7 million and $4.2 million , respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_14_ITEM8_P80_S3	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company has accrued $133.0 million and $117.5 million , respectively, for the payment of interest.
891103_14_ITEM8_P80_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company has accrued $5.1 million and $5.0 million , respectively, for penalties.
891103_14_ITEM8_P80_S5	The Company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax.

891103_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to IAC shareholders.
891103_14_ITEM8_P129_S0	(a) If the effect is dilutive, weighted average common shares outstanding include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants and vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs").
891103_14_ITEM8_P129_S1	As of May 8, 2012, there are no warrants outstanding.
891103_14_ITEM8_P130_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 approximately 0.4 million , 0.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively, related to potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	(b) Performance-based stock units ("PSUs") are included in the denominator for earnings per share if (i) the applicable performance condition(s) has been met and (ii) the inclusion of the PSUs is dilutive for the respective reporting periods.
891103_14_ITEM8_P131_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , all PSUs that were considered to be probable of vesting are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their performance conditions had been met.
891103_14_ITEM8_P131_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 approximately 0.1 million and 3.1 million PSUs, respectively, that were probable of vesting were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the performance conditions had not been met.
891103_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	NOTE 14 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IAC currently has three active plans under which awards have been granted.
891103_14_ITEM8_P132_S1	These plans cover stock options to acquire shares of IAC common stock, RSUs, PSUs and restricted stock, as well as provide for the future grant of these and other equity awards.
891103_14_ITEM8_P132_S2	These plans authorize the Company to grant awards to its employees, officers, directors and consultants.
891103_14_ITEM8_P132_S3	At December 31, 2013 , there are 13.9 million shares available for grant under the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
891103_14_ITEM8_P132_S4	The plans were adopted in 2005, 2008 and 2013, have a stated term of ten years , and provide that the exercise price of stock options granted will not be less than the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date.
891103_14_ITEM8_P132_S5	The plans do not specify grant dates or vesting schedules of awards as those determinations have been delegated to the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of IAC's Board of Directors (the "Committee").
891103_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	schedule for that particular grant as determined by the Committee.
891103_14_ITEM8_P133_S1	Broad-based stock option awards issued to date have generally vested in equal annual installments over a four -year period and RSU awards currently outstanding generally vest in two 50% installments over a three and four-year period, in each case, from the grant date.
891103_14_ITEM8_P133_S2	PSU awards issued to date generally cliff vest at the end of a two to three -year period from the date of grant.
891103_14_ITEM8_P133_S3	In addition to equity awards outstanding under the three plans, stock options and other equity awards outstanding under terminated plans and plans assumed in acquisitions are reflected in the information set forth below.
891103_14_ITEM8_P133_S4	The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is reduced by estimated forfeitures, as the expense recorded is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
891103_14_ITEM8_P133_S5	The forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated rate.
891103_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 related to stock-based compensation is $19.3 million , $31.3 million and $32.7 million , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P134_S1	At December 31, 2013 , there is $86.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.2 years.
891103_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	Stock Options A summary of changes in outstanding stock options is as follows:
891103_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between IAC's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2013 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2013.
891103_14_ITEM8_P136_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of IAC's common stock.
891103_14_ITEM8_P136_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 is $65.6 million , $84.8 million and $70.6 million , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2013 :
891103_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
891103_14_ITEM8_P138_S1	Approximately 0.7 million , 3.6 million and 2.6 million stock options were granted by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P139_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_14_ITEM8_P139_S1	During 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.
891103_14_ITEM8_P139_S2	Expected term is based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees and the risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields for notes with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date.
891103_14_ITEM8_P140_S0	The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
891103_14_ITEM8_P141_S0	The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 with exercise prices equal to the market prices of IAC's common stock on the date of grant are $10.67 , $10.69 and $11.08 , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P141_S1	There are no stock options issued during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant.
891103_14_ITEM8_P141_S2	The weighted average exercise price and weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2012 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant are $ 60.00 and $ 7.61 , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P141_S3	Cash received from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit realized for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are: $40.7 million and $69.4 million ; $58.2 million and $74.3 million ; and $89.8 million and $25.5 million , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P141_S4	In December 2013, the Company's former Chief Executive Officer (the "Executive") became the Chairman of the newly created Match Group; in connection with the Executive's new compensation arrangement, the Executive exercised 0.5 million stock options, which were settled by the Company for $9.2 million in cash.
891103_14_ITEM8_P142_S0	Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Stock Units RSUs and PSUs are awards in the form of phantom shares or units, denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of IAC common stock and with the value of each RSU and PSU equal to the fair value of IAC common stock at the date of grant.
891103_14_ITEM8_P142_S1	RSUs and PSUs may be settled in cash, stock or both, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
891103_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	Each RSU and PSU grant is subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests.
891103_14_ITEM8_P143_S1	PSUs also include performance-based vesting, where certain performance targets set at the time of grant must be achieved before an award vests.
891103_14_ITEM8_P143_S2	The Company recognizes expense for all RSUs and PSUs for which vesting is considered probable.
891103_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_14_ITEM8_P144_S1	For PSU grants, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_14_ITEM8_P144_S2	Nonvested RSUs and PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2013 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2013 are as follows:
891103_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) Included in the table are PSUs which vest at the end of two or three years in varying amounts depending upon certain performance conditions.
891103_14_ITEM8_P145_S1	The PSU table above includes these awards at their maximum potential payout.
891103_14_ITEM8_P145_S2	The weighted average fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 based on market prices of IAC's common stock on the grant date was $42.32 , $46.24 and $32.41 , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P145_S3	The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $14.5 million , $139.0 million and $33.2 million , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	Equity Instruments Denominated in the Shares of Certain Subsidiaries IAC has granted phantom equity units and stock options in various operating subsidiaries to certain members of the subsidiaries' management.
891103_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events.
891103_14_ITEM8_P146_S2	In some cases, IAC has taken a preferred interest in the subsidiary with a face value equal to the subsidiary's acquisition price or, when funding a start-up business, its investment cost, or a certain other fixed amount.
891103_14_ITEM8_P146_S3	In some cases, these preferred interests accrete with paid-in-kind dividends at a prescribed rate of return.
891103_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	The value of the phantom equity units and stock options is tied to the value of the common stock of the entity, with the equity awards management receives as a whole generally representing a small minority of the total common stock outstanding.
891103_14_ITEM8_P147_S1	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the preferred interest (including the accretion of dividends), our investment cost or other fixed amount or, in the case of stock options, the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_14_ITEM8_P147_S2	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_14_ITEM8_P147_S3	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock or cash at the option of IAC, with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration, at various dates through 2019.
891103_14_ITEM8_P147_S4	The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_14_ITEM8_P147_S5	The aggregate number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at December 31, 2013 is 1.8 million shares, which is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.
891103_14_ITEM8_P147_S6	The comparable amount at December 31, 2012 is 2.0 million shares.
891103_14_ITEM8_P148_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker views the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_14_ITEM8_P148_S1	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of the "Other" reportable segment, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate operating segments.
891103_14_ITEM8_P149_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) The Company's primary metric is Operating Income Before Amortization, which is defined as operating income excluding, if applicable: (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) amortization and impairment of intangibles, (3) goodwill impairment, (4) acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments and (5) one-time items.
891103_14_ITEM8_P149_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful to investors because it represents the consolidated operating results from IAC's segments, taking into account depreciation, which it believes is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the effects of any other non-cash expenses.
891103_14_ITEM8_P150_S0	Operating Income Before Amortization has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses, including non-cash compensation and acquisition-related accounting.
891103_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-U.S. GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable U.S. GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence, financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-U.S. GAAP measure.
891103_14_ITEM8_P151_S1	(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.
891103_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	Revenue by geography is based on where the customer is located.
891103_14_ITEM8_P152_S1	Geographic information about revenue and long-lived assets is presented below:
891103_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	The following tables reconcile Operating Income Before Amortization to operating income (loss) for the Company's reportable segments:
891103_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	The following tables reconcile segment assets to total assets:
891103_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	_____________________________________ (c) Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and IAC's headquarters building.
891103_14_ITEM8_P155_S1	NOTE 16 COMMITMENTS The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with its operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses.
891103_14_ITEM8_P155_S2	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement.
891103_14_ITEM8_P155_S3	These operating expenses are not included in the table below.
891103_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	Future minimum payments under operating lease agreements are as follows:
891103_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	Expenses charged to operations under these agreements are $36.7 million , $30.6 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
891103_14_ITEM8_P157_S1	The Company's most significant operating lease is a seventy-seven years land lease for IAC's headquarters building in New York City and approximates 57% of the future minimum payments due under all operating lease agreements in the table above.
891103_14_ITEM8_P157_S2	The Company also has funding commitments that could potentially require its performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events as follows:
891103_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments, which commitments are reducible or terminable such that these commitments can never exceed associated revenue by a meaningful amount.
891103_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	Purchase obligations also include minimum payments due under telecommunication contracts related to data transmission lines.
891103_14_ITEM8_P158_S2	The letters of credit support the Company's casualty insurance program.
891103_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	NOTE 17 CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits.
891103_14_ITEM8_P159_S1	The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
891103_14_ITEM8_P159_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_14_ITEM8_P159_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_14_ITEM8_P159_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss.
891103_14_ITEM8_P159_S5	It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.
891103_14_ITEM8_P159_S6	See Note 4 for additional information related to income tax contingencies.
891103_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	NOTE 18 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Supplemental Disclosure of Non-Cash Transactions for 2013 The consideration for the acquisition of Twoo on January 4, 2013 includes a contingent consideration arrangement, which is described in Note 5 and Note 9.

891103_14_ITEM8_P163_S5	Investment options in the plan include IAC common stock, but neither participant nor matching contributions are required to be invested in IAC common stock.
891103_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	IAC also has or participates in various benefit plans, principally defined contribution plans, for its international employees.

891103_14_ITEM8_P164_S2	The increase in contributions in 2012 is primarily related to Meetic, consolidated beginning September 1, 2011.
891103_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	During the second quarter of 2013, certain expenses were reclassified between cost of revenue, selling and marketing expense, general and administrative expense and product development expense.
891103_14_ITEM8_P165_S1	Accordingly, cost of revenue presented above for periods prior to the second quarter of 2013 differs from the amounts reflected in the Company s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2013 and the second and third quarters of 2012.

891103_14_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
891103_14_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

891103_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
891103_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

891103_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our History IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc.
891103_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company.
891103_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	From 1997 through 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group (and the remaining interest in 1998), Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com) and Expedia, as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies.
891103_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	In 2002, the Company contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, a joint venture, and sold its interests in that venture to NBC Universal in 2005.
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	In 2003, the Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire).
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. (now known as IAC Search Media, Inc.) and completed the separation of its travel and travel related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc.
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2008, IAC separated into five publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster and Tree.com, Inc.
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	In 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic S.A. (now known as Meetic S.A.S. ( Meetic )), a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a 5 million note.
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S4	In 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation s equity stake in IAC.
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S5	In 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%.
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S6	In 2012, we acquired The About Group, which primarily consists of About.com, a comprehensive online content and reference library.
891103_15_ITEM1_P2_S7	In 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic, ValueClick s Owned and Operated website businesses, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, as well as The Princeton Review, a leading test preparation and college admission services company.

891103_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The use of words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, plans and believes, among others, generally identify forward looking statements.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These forward looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC s future financial performance, IAC s business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which IAC s businesses operate and other similar matters.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These forward looking statements are based on IAC management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements for a variety of reasons, including, among others, the risk factors set forth below.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC s business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S7	IAC does not undertake to update these forward looking statements.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Risk Factors Mr. Diller owns a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S9	As of January 30, 2015, Mr. Diller owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock representing 100% of IAC s outstanding Class B common stock and approximately 42.5% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S10	As of this date, Mr. Diller also owned 930,734 vested options to purchase IAC common stock and 75,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S11	In addition, under an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC s Chairman and Senior Executive, he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve month period.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P1_S12	While Mr. Diller may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case IAC would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller s ownership interest, voting power and the contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller currently is in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In addition, this concentration of voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P3_S3	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Effective succession planning is also important to our future success.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P3_S5	If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google that expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Search Applications properties.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search related services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to advertisers) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Search Applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to users) of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Changes to Google s paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our Search Applications properties, its judgment about the relative attractiveness to users of paid listings from searches or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our services agreement with Google requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its brands and services, including the manner in which Google s paid listings are displayed within search results, and that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Noncompliance with Google s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could, if not cured, result in Google s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners, the imposition of additional restrictions on our ability to syndicate paid listings or the termination of the services agreement by Google.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of IAC s rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, our inability to obtain a renewal of our agreement with Google with substantially comparable economic and other terms upon the expiration of our current agreement could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In addition, Google's ability to limit our ability to market our products and services through its advertising services, whether due to policy or competitive reasons or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	General economic events or trends that reduce advertising spending could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S8	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to online advertising.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P5_S9	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Small and local businesses with which we do business are particularly sensitive to these events and trends, given that they are not as well situated to weather adverse economic conditions as their larger competitors, which are generally better capitalized and have greater access to credit.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the Internet.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of models that incorporate user targeting and/or utilize mobile devices), the continued growth in commercial use of the Internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to the passage of laws requiring additional disclosure, an industry-wide move to self-regulatory principles that require additional disclosure and/or opt-in policies for advertising that incorporate user targeting or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We depend, in part, upon arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites and distribute our products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	We engage in a variety of activities designed to attract traffic to our various websites and convert visitors into repeat users and customers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	How successful we are in these efforts depends, in part, upon our continued ability to enter into arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our various websites, as well as the continued introduction of new and enhanced products and services that resonate with users and customers generally.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S7	For example, we have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute Search Applications search boxes, toolbars and other applications to users through third parties.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Most of these agreements are either non exclusive and short term in nature or, in the case of long term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S9	In addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our B2B operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Our inability to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute our search boxes, toolbars and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in website traffic, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S11	In addition, in the case of the businesses within The Match Group segment, we have entered into a number of arrangements with third parties to drive traffic to our online personals websites.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S12	Pursuant to these arrangements, third parties generally promote our services on their websites or through e-mail campaigns and we either pay a fixed fee when visitors to these websites click through to (or register with) our online personals websites or pay a percentage of revenue we receive from such visitors who pay us subscription fees.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S13	These arrangements are generally not exclusive, are short term in nature and are generally terminable by either party given notice.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P7_S14	If existing arrangements with third parties are terminated (or are not renewed upon their expiration) and we fail to replace this traffic and related revenues, or if we are unable to enter into new arrangements with existing and/or new third parties in response to industry trends, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In the case of our HomeAdvisor business, our ability to drive traffic depends, in part, on the nature and number of home services professionals who are members of our network.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	While these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long term agreements with them generally and subscription memberships may be canceled at any time.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, which are particularly sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as constrained liquidity and decreases in consumer spending.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	As a result, our network of home services professionals experiences turnover.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	This turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to HomeAdvisor.com and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Even if we succeed in driving traffic to our properties, we may not be able to convert this traffic or otherwise retain users and customers unless we continue to provide quality products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	For example, in the case of About.com, we rely on independent, freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content for our users.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally and/or the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in a cost-effective manner, the experience of our users would be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In addition, we may not be able to adapt quickly and/or in a cost-effective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements and/or new products or services to the market.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our inability to provide quality products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users, customers and revenues and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As discussed below, our traffic building and conversion initiatives also involve the expenditure of considerable sums for marketing, as well as for the development and introduction of new products, services and enhancements, infrastructure and other related efforts.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords, which we purchase primarily through Google), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In the case of our search engine marketing efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may be unilaterally updated by Google without advance notice), could adversely affect the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the related user experience, as well as adversely affect the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally, which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	In the case of paid advertising generally, the policies of sellers and publishers of advertising (including Google) may limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	One of the most cost-effective efforts we employ to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) users and customers is commonly referred to as search engine optimization, or SEO.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	SEO involves developing websites to rank well within search engine results.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of search results.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The failure to successfully manage SEO efforts across our businesses, including the timely modification of SEO efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, search engines continue to expand their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Lastly, as discussed above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to increase traffic, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Any failure to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S7	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to build, maintain and/or enhance our various brands.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of highly-recognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries, as well as a number of fledgling brands that we are in the process of building.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P14_S9	We believe that our success depends, in part, upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance our established brands, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) our fledgling brands.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Moreover, the failure to market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the Internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact our various brands and brand-building efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The Internet and related technologies and applications continue to evolve and we may not be able to adapt to these changes.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The development of new products and services in response to the evolving trends and technologies of the Internet, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, require significant time and resources.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-effective manner) to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new products and services to the market or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately (and/or in a cost effective manner) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In the case of certain of our applications, third parties have introduced (and continue to introduce) new or updated technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services (such as through the introduction of features and/or processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use our services relative to those of our competitors).
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, there are technologies that interfere with the functionality of (or settings changes made by) our applications.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S7	For example, there are technologies that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S8	These technologies, applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications, which in turn adversely impacts our revenues.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of advertisements on web pages and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Our failure to successfully modify our toolbars and other applications in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S11	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S13	While many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S14	While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services (and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices) and intend to continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our non-mobile products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S15	In addition, the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S16	Lastly, as the adoption of mobile devices becomes more widespread, we will need to take steps to ensure that our products and services are attractive to users of mobile devices.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P16_S17	This shift could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to replace the related revenues.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	security standards, industry self-regulating principles that have become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections (and related compliance obligations) regarding privacy and data security.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In addition, if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy, it could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act (and/or brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law), as well as a private lawsuit under various U.S. federal and state laws.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Similarly, in the European Union, the online service provider could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for the violation of the data protection laws and regulations brought by a member state or its supervisory authority (an independent body charged with monitoring compliance with data protection laws), as well as private causes of action under the EU Directive.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In general, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world (particularly in the European Union), the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	U.S. and foreign legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, in May 2014, the White House released a review of "big data" practices, which called for an update to U.S. privacy laws based on the proposed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights released by the White House in February 2012 and the enactment of a federal data breach notification law.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, in February 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a report seeking changes in Internet and mobile privacy protection and disclosures.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Similarly, new privacy laws and regulations at the state level, as well as new laws and directives abroad (particularly in the European Union), are being proposed and implemented.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	For example, legislation in the state of California that became effective on January 1, 2014 requires companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser Do Not Track signals and the European Union is in the process of adopting new guidelines for data protection and privacy to address recent globalization and technological developments, which will supersede the EU Directive.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In addition, existing privacy laws that were intended for brick-and-mortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws) in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses and/or limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities, such as targeted advertising, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data, credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Moreover, any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally, which would decrease traffic to (and in turn, usage and transactions on) the relevant website and/or our various websites and which in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies, federal, state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or PCI standards, as well as the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We may not be able to protect our systems, infrastructures and technologies from cyber attacks.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyber attacks experienced by third parties.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Any disruption of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, or compromise of our user data or other information, due to cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyber attacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks or other malicious activities (or any combination of these events) is on the rise worldwide.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	From time to time, we may become the victim of these types of attacks.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	While we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that these events will not occur in the future and if they do occur, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Furthermore, we may become the victim of security breaches, such as the misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of user, customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations).
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Any cyber attack or security breach we experience could prevent us from providing our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as result in a degradation of our products and services and/or cause damage to our systems, infrastructures, technologies and data.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) could have a similar effect.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Moreover, even cyber attacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S7	As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S8	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P23_S9	Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	successfully manage acquisition related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the Internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	For example, we may experience difficulties in managing international operations due to distance, language and cultural differences and political and/or economic instability, including issues associated with establishing and maintaining effective management systems and infrastructures (including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), the staffing of foreign operations, exchange rate fluctuations and online privacy and protection of personal information.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Laws that do reference the Internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S5	For example, through our various businesses we post and link to third party content, including third party advertisements, links and websites.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S6	We also allow users to submit content, such as comments, photographs and videos.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We could be subject to liability for posting, hosting or linking to third party content, and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims, we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Some laws, including the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S9	For example, the DMCA generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user, so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S10	However, the scope and applicability of the DMCA are subject to judicial interpretation and, as such, remain uncertain, and the U.S. Congress may enact legislation affecting (and potentially limiting) the protections afforded by the DMCA to online service providers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S11	Moreover, similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S12	As a result, claims have been, and could be, threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting, among other things, negligence, defamation, invasion of privacy or right or publicity, copyright infringement or trademark infringement.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S13	Also, we send electronic messages to users through our various businesses, as well as develop, market and/or distribute a variety of downloadable applications through our B2C and B2B operations, which could subject us to liability for failing to comply with laws governing the sending of electronic messages to our users and the installation of downloadable applications.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S14	For example, Canada s Anti-Spam Legislation ( CASL ), which became effective on July 1, 2014, prohibits all commercial electronic messages (including e-mail, text, social media, sound and image messages) that are sent without proper consumer consent.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S15	And, effective January 15, 2015, the CASL restricts the unsolicited installation of computer programs and applications.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S16	While several Canadian regulators are jointly empowered to enforce and issue administrative and monetary penalties for CASL violations, effective July 1, 2017 individuals may also file private and class action lawsuits to collect statutory damages for CASL violations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S17	In addition, changing Internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S18	One example of such changing practices is the increasing use of native advertising, a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P28_S19	The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P29_S5	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P29_S6	We regard our intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and other similar intellectual property, as critical to our success.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	About.com, Dictionary.com, Investopedia, PriceRunner, Ask.fm, our various toolbar brands, SlimWare, Match.com, OkCupid.com, OurTime.com, Meetic.com, HomeAdvisor.com and ShoeBuy.com and related domain names and logos), through which they market their products and services and seek to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	So long as these businesses continue to police unauthorized use of these trademarks and take action against infringement, use these trademarks to identify their products and services and timely renew trademark and related domain name registrations as required, they should continue to enjoy trademark protection indefinitely under current laws, rules and regulations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The businesses within our Search Applications segment also rely upon trade secrets, including algorithms for the generation, organization and presentation of search results.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	To a lesser extent, these businesses also rely upon patented and patent pending proprietary technologies and processes, primarily those relating to search related products and services, with expiration dates for patented technologies ranging from 2017 to 2033, and copyrighted material, primarily software and content, such as emoticons, characters and other content that is incorporated into (and used in connection with the marketing of) toolbars and applications generally.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The Match Group segment also relies upon trade secrets and patented (with expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2034) and patent pending proprietary technologies relating to matching process systems and related features, products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	HomeAdvisor relies heavily upon trade secrets, primarily the matching algorithm through which members of its network of home services professionals are matched with consumers, as well as related patented proprietary technologies that expire in 2020.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S6	No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S7	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P32_S9	The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	To succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Moreover, as traffic to our websites, applications and online properties increases and the number of new (and presumably more complex) products and services that we introduce continues to grow, we will need to upgrade our systems, infrastructures and technologies generally to facilitate this growth.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	prolonged basis, which could adversely affect the quality of their experiences.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, we could experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, which could have the same effect.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Moreover, even if we do not experience inefficiencies and/or operational failures in connection with these efforts, third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) may not make the changes to their systems, infrastructures and technologies needed to access our products and services on a timely basis, if at all.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	We also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S6	Furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S8	While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S9	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S10	If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P36_S11	Our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
891103_15_ITEM1A_P37_S6	Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	All of IAC's leases are at prevailing market rates.
891103_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	IAC believes that the duration of each lease is adequate.
891103_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	IAC believes that its principal properties, whether owned or leased, are currently adequate for the purposes for which they are used and are suitably maintained for these purposes.
891103_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	IAC does not anticipate any future problems renewing or obtaining suitable leases for any of its principal properties.
891103_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	IAC's approximately 202,500 square foot corporate headquarters in New York, New York houses offices for IAC corporate and various IAC businesses within the following segments: Search Applications, The Match Group and Media.
891103_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the registrant's business) to which the registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve claims for damages for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
891103_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the judgment of Company management, none of the pending litigation matters which the Company and its subsidiaries are defending involves (or is likely to involve) amounts of that magnitude, nor do such matters involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to the Company's shareholders.
891103_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no established public trading market for IAC Class B common stock.
891103_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share for IAC common stock as reported on NASDAQ.
891103_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 23, 2015, there were approximately 1,600 holders of record of the Company's common stock and the closing price of IAC common stock on NASDAQ was $67.22.
891103_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	Because the substantial majority of the outstanding shares of IAC common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, IAC is not able to estimate the total number of beneficial shareholders represented by these record holders.
891103_15_ITEM5_P1_S2	As of February 23, 2015, there was one holder of record of the Company's Class B common stock.

891103_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Included in the proceeds related to the issuance of common stock are proceeds of $284.1 million from the exercise of warrants to acquire 11.7 million shares of IAC common stock, some of which were exercised on a cashless or net basis.
891103_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	The weighted average strike price of the warrants was $28.40 per share.
891103_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as its cash flows generated from operations.
891103_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	The Company has a $300.0 million revolving credit facility, which expires on December 21, 2017, and is available as an additional source of financing.
891103_15_ITEM7_P41_S2	At December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
891103_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations.
891103_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Company expects that 2015 capital expenditures will be higher than 2014.
891103_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	At December 31, 2014, IAC had 8.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
891103_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
891103_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	On February 3, 2015, IAC declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share of common and Class B common stock outstanding payable on March 1, 2015 to stockholders of record on February 15, 2015.
891103_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Future declarations of dividends are subject to the determination of IAC's Board of Directors.
891103_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with its expected positive cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under its $300.0 million revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to fund its normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, share repurchases, quarterly cash dividends, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.
891103_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services.
891103_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Company may make acquisitions and investments that could reduce its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and as a result, the Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility.
891103_15_ITEM7_P46_S2	Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.
891103_15_ITEM7_P46_S3	The indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event we are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0.
891103_15_ITEM7_P46_S4	In addition, the terms of the revolving credit facility require that we maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
891103_15_ITEM7_P46_S5	As of December 31, 2014, the Company was in compliance with all of these covenants.
891103_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	The Company has excluded $30.9 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.
891103_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	For additional information on income taxes, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

891103_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	These operating expenses are not included in the table above.
891103_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	(d) The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments, which commitments are reducible or terminable such that these commitments can never exceed associated revenue by a meaningful amount.
891103_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (e) Commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events.
891103_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the items described above, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2014.
891103_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	IAC'S PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING IAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_15_ITEM7_P52_S4	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
891103_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Definition of IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding: (1) non-cash compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments.
891103_15_ITEM7_P53_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Non-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based RSUs.
891103_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury method; however, performance-based RSUs are included only to the extent the performance criteria have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period).
891103_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives.
891103_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments are non-cash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions.
891103_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	While it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we continue to acquire companies, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss) by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
891103_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
891103_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
891103_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	In connection with some business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics.
891103_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	The Company generally determines the fair value of contingent consideration using probability-weighted analyses over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and, to the extent the arrangement is long-term in nature, applies a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation.
891103_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
891103_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Determining fair value is inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
891103_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	See Note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	The 2014, 2013 and 2012 annual assessments identified no material impairments.
891103_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	The value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $1.8 billion and $405.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014.
891103_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a two-step process.
891103_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach based on multiples of earnings.
891103_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 19% in 2014 and 13% to 25% in 2013.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S6	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
891103_15_ITEM7_P72_S7	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
891103_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid.
891103_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	Any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	A primary driver in the DCF valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability.
891103_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Generally, the Company would expect an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	This assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	At October 1, 2014, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of the Company's reporting units exceed their carrying values.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	The fair value of the Search Applications reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15%.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	If operating results vary significantly from anticipated results, future, potentially material, impairments of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets could occur.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	To illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment charge relative to future changes in estimated fair value, had the estimated fair value of Search Applications been hypothetically lower by 20% as of October 1, 2014, the carrying value of Search Applications would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $100 million.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S4	The Company also has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S5	If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined; otherwise the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset must be determined and compared to its carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S6	If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S7	The estimates of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_15_ITEM7_P76_S8	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10% to 20% in 2014 and 10% to 18% in 2013, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2014 and 2013.
891103_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	During 2013 the Company wrote off certain capitalized software costs.
891103_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $389.2 million at December 31, 2014.
891103_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Income Taxes We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process.
891103_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_15_ITEM7_P81_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_15_ITEM7_P81_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $33.2 million, including interest.
891103_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_15_ITEM7_P85_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $390.4 million.
891103_15_ITEM7_P85_S4	Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	Stock-Based Compensation As disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2014, 2013 and 2012 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 1.5%, 1.0% and 0.6%, respectively, a dividend yield of 1.5%, 2.0% and 1.2%, respectively, volatility factors of 31%, 29% and 31%, respectively, based on the historical stock price volatilities of IAC and a weighted average expected term of the stock options of 4.8 years, 6.2 years and 4.4 years, respectively.
891103_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	For stock options, including unvested stock options assumed in acquisitions, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date (or acquisition date, if applicable) at fair value and expensed over the remaining vesting term.
891103_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	The impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $2.5 million, $11.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively.
891103_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	The impact on non-cash compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, assuming a 1% increase in the dividend yield of the outstanding options, would be a decrease of $1.1 million.
891103_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs.
891103_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	For RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation expense over the vesting term.
891103_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	For performance-based RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Marketable Securities and Long-term Investments At December 31, 2014, marketable securities consist of short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Long-term investments include equity securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods and marketable equity securities.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S2	The Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S3	The Company also invests in marketable equity securities as part of its investment strategy.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S4	Marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S5	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S6	The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S7	Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S8	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S9	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S10	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S11	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S12	During 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized impairment charges of $66.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, related to cost method investments and during 2012, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $8.7 million related to one of its long-term marketable equity securities.
891103_15_ITEM7_P89_S13	, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and long-term debt.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which consist of money market funds and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 2014, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by $2.1 million.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Conversely, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of $990.4 million is invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	At December 31, 2014, the Company's outstanding debt is $1.1 billion , all of which pays interest at fixed rates.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P2_S5	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $60.5 million.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P2_S6	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Equity Price Risk The Company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its investments.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	At December 31, 2014, the Company has two investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	These available-for-sale marketable equity securities are reported at fair value based on their quoted market prices with any unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, included as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are exposed to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the stock market.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	During 2014 and 2013, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its available-for-sale marketable equity securities.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	During 2012, the Company recorded an $8.7 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to one of its available-for-sale marketable equity securities.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The other-than-temporary impairment charge is included in "Other (expense) income, net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro and British Pound Sterling.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	However, the exposure is mitigated since the Company has generally reinvested cash flows from international operations in order to grow the businesses.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The statements of operations of these international businesses are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S4	To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign activities result in reduced revenue and operating results.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S5	Similarly, the Company's revenue and operating results will increase for our international operations if the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S6	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S7	The economic impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on the Company is often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P5_S8	These changes, if material, could cause the Company to adjust its financing and operating strategies.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are not material to the Company's earnings in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exchange risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	However, the Company periodically reviews its strategy for hedging foreign currency exchange risks.
891103_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Company's objective in managing its foreign currency exchange risk is to minimize its potential exposure to the changes that foreign currency exchange rates might have on its earnings, cash flows and financial position.

891103_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial matters of the investee are accounted for using the cost method.
891103_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Investments in companies that IAC does not control, which are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also accounted for using the cost method.
891103_15_ITEM8_P18_S3	The Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_15_ITEM8_P18_S4	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.

891103_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	Certain Risks and Concentrations A substantial portion of the Company's revenue is derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
891103_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Significant changes in this industry or changes in advertising spending behavior or in customer buying behavior could adversely affect our operating results.
891103_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	Most of the Company's online advertising revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2016.

891103_15_ITEM8_P33_S2	Subject to certain limitations, Google may unilaterally update its policies and guidelines, which could require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

891103_15_ITEM8_P35_S2	Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with financial institutions and are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
891103_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves.
891103_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
891103_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.
891103_15_ITEM8_P36_S3	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
891103_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments.
891103_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	The amounts of these reserves are based, in part, on historical experience.
891103_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including significant improvements, are recorded at cost.
891103_15_ITEM8_P37_S3	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
891103_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Company capitalizes certain internal use software costs including external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the software and compensation for personnel directly associated with the development of the software.
891103_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
891103_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	The net book value of capitalized internal use software is $36.9 million and $30.9 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
891103_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	In connection with some business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics.
891103_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Company generally determines the fair value of contingent consideration using probability-weighted analyses over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled, and, to the extent the arrangement is long-term in nature, applies a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation.
891103_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
891103_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Determining fair value is inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
891103_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	See Note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	There were no material impairment charges recorded in the three year period ended December 31, 2014.
891103_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	At October 1, 2014, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of the Company's reporting units exceed their carrying values.
891103_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	The fair value of the Search Applications reporting unit currently exceeds its carrying value by approximately 15% .
891103_15_ITEM8_P44_S5	If operating results vary significantly from anticipated results, future, potentially material, impairments of goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangible assets could occur.
891103_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	lower by 20% as of October 1, 2014, the carrying value of Search Applications would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $100 million .
891103_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise, the fair value of the reporting unit has to be determined and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company also has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.
891103_15_ITEM8_P46_S3	If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the fair value of the asset does not need to be determined; otherwise, the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset has to be determined and if its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its reporting units using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach based on a multiple of earnings.
891103_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_15_ITEM8_P48_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_15_ITEM8_P48_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on each reporting unit's current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_15_ITEM8_P48_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 13% to 19% in 2014 and 13% to 25% in 2013 .
891103_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using avoided royalty DCF analyses.
891103_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_15_ITEM8_P51_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 10% to 20% in 2014 and 10% to 18% in 2013 , and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2014 and 2013 .
891103_15_ITEM8_P51_S3	The Company's reporting units are consistent with its determination of its operating segments.
891103_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
891103_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	See Note 13 for additional information regarding the Company's method of determining operating and reportable segments.
891103_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Definite Lives Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is computed either on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset will be realized.
891103_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.
891103_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used.
891103_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
891103_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	See Note 7 for a discussion of fair value measurements made using Level 3 inputs.
891103_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity and cost method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.
891103_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.
891103_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Traffic Acquisition Costs Traffic acquisition costs consist of payments made to partners who distribute our B2B customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites or direct traffic to our websites.
891103_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements.
891103_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company expenses these payments in the period incurred as a component of cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred (when the advertisement first runs for production costs that are initially capitalized) and represent online marketing, including fees paid to search engines and third parties that distribute our B2C downloadable applications, and offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising.
891103_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Advertising expense is $971.8 million , $824.1 million and $774.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company capitalizes and amortizes the costs associated with certain distribution arrangements that require it to pay a fee per access point delivered.
891103_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	These access points are generally in the form of downloadable applications associated with our B2C operations.
891103_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	These fees are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent the Company can reasonably estimate a probable future economic benefit and the period over which such benefit will be realized (generally 18 months).
891103_15_ITEM8_P62_S3	Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred.
891103_15_ITEM8_P62_S4	Legal Costs Legal costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	Income Taxes The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
891103_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company records interest, net of any applicable related income tax benefit, on potential income tax contingencies as a component of income tax expense.
891103_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
891103_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vested resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
891103_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	The financial position and operating results of foreign entities whose primary economic environment is based on their local currency are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency.
891103_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	These local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses of these operations are translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
891103_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity.
891103_15_ITEM8_P67_S3	Transaction gains and losses resulting from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of other (expense) income, net.
891103_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Translation gains and losses relating to foreign entities that are liquidated or substantially liquidated are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the requisite service period.
891103_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	See Note 12 for a discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
891103_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the consolidated subsidiaries of the Company should ordinarily be reported on the consolidated balance sheet within shareholders' equity, separately from the Company's equity.
891103_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	However, securities that are redeemable at the option of the holder and not solely within the control of the issuer must be classified outside of shareholders' equity.
891103_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	Accordingly, if redemption of the noncontrolling interests is outside the control of the Company, the interests are included outside of shareholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	In connection with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries, management of these businesses has retained an ownership interest.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Company is party to fair value put and call arrangements with respect to these interests.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	These put and call arrangements allow management of these businesses to require the Company to purchase their interests or allow the Company to acquire such interests at fair value, respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S3	The put arrangements do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument as the put agreements do not provide for net settlement.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S4	These put and call arrangements become exercisable by the Company and the counter-party at various dates over the next four years.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S5	No put and call arrangements were exercised during 2014 and 2012.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S6	During 2013, two of these arrangements were exercised.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S7	These put arrangements are exercisable by the counter-party outside the control of the Company.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S8	Accordingly, to the extent that the fair value of these interests exceeds the value determined by normal noncontrolling interest accounting, the value of such interests is adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
891103_15_ITEM8_P71_S9	During the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , the Company recorded adjustments of $27.8 million , $40.6 million and $4.3 million , respectively, to increase these interests to fair value.
891103_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Fair value determinations require high levels of judgment and are based on various valuation techniques, including market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.
891103_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common standard for all industries.
891103_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	The new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
891103_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or cumulative effect approach to adopt ASU No. 2014-09.
891103_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not yet determined whether the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or the method of adoption.
891103_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
891103_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	NOTE 3 INCOME TAXES U.S. and foreign earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
891103_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	The components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes attributable to continuing operations are as follows:
891103_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The current income tax payable was reduced by $45.0 million , $32.9 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, for excess tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation.
891103_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	The related income tax benefits are recorded as increases to additional paid-in capital.
891103_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	Income taxes receivable (payable) and deferred tax assets (liabilities) are included in the following captions in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
891103_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	The tax effects of cumulative temporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below.
891103_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the Company has federal and state net operating losses ("NOLs") of $61.5 million and $82.6 million , respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	If not utilized, the federal NOLs will expire at various times between 2023 and 2034, and the state NOLs will expire at various times between 2015 and 2034.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S2	Utilization of federal NOLs will be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S3	In addition, utilization of certain state NOLs may be subject to limitations under state laws similar to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S4	At December 31, 2014 , the Company has foreign NOLs of $107.5 million available to offset future income.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S5	Of these foreign NOLs, $98.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $9.3 million will expire at various times between 2015 and 2034.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S6	During 2014 , the Company recognized tax benefits related to NOLs of $0.8 million .
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S7	At December 31, 2014 , the Company has $5.1 million of state capital losses.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S8	If not utilized, the state capital losses will expire between 2015 and 2017.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S9	Utilization of capital losses will be limited to the Company's ability to generate future capital gains.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S10	At December 31, 2014 , the Company has tax credit carryforwards of $19.0 million .
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S11	Of this amount, $5.2 million relates to federal credits for foreign taxes, $8.2 million relates to state tax credits for research activities, and $5.6 million relates to various state and local tax credits.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S12	Of these credit carryforwards, $10.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $9.0 million will expire within ten years.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S13	During 2014 , the Company's valuation allowance increased by $36.0 million primarily due to increases in unrealized capital losses, net operating losses, and tax credits.
891103_15_ITEM8_P81_S14	At December 31, 2014 , the Company has a valuation allowance of $98.3 million related to the portion of tax loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	A reconciliation of the income tax provision to the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is shown as follows:
891103_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	No income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $605.7 million at December 31, 2014 .
891103_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings is $141.5 million .
891103_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, is as follows:
891103_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision.
891103_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	Included in the income tax provision for continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is a $58.5 million benefit, $4.8 million expense and $5.2 million expense, respectively, net of related deferred taxes of $35.3 million , $2.8 million and $3.1 million , respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	Included in the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is a $19.7 million benefit, $1.4 million expense and $2.8 million benefit, respectively, net of related deferred taxes of $11.7 million , $0.8 million and $1.7 million , respectively, for interest on unrecognized tax benefits.
891103_15_ITEM8_P85_S3	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company has accrued $2.8 million and $133.0 million , respectively, for the payment of interest.
891103_15_ITEM8_P85_S4	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company has accrued $2.9 million and $5.1 million , respectively, for penalties.
891103_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax.
891103_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions.
891103_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing the Company s federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2010 through 2012.
891103_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	Various other jurisdictions are open to examination for various tax years beginning with 2006.

891103_15_ITEM8_P138_S1	This amount changes based on the fair market value of IAC's common stock.
891103_15_ITEM8_P138_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is $63.3 million , $65.6 million and $84.8 million , respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2014 :
891103_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
891103_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	During 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.
891103_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields for notes with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date.
891103_15_ITEM8_P142_S1	Expected term is based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees and the dividend yields are based on IAC's historical dividend payments.
891103_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
891103_15_ITEM8_P144_S0	Approximately 0.7 million , 0.7 million and 3.6 million stock options were granted by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.

891103_15_ITEM8_P144_S2	There are no stock options issued during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant.
891103_15_ITEM8_P144_S3	The weighted average exercise price and weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2012 with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant are $ 60.00 and $ 7.61 , respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P144_S4	Cash received from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit realized for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 are: $39.1 million and $25.5 million ; $40.7 million and $17.2 million ; and $58.2 million and $28.2 million , respectively.

891103_15_ITEM8_P144_S6	In January 2014, a portion of the Executive's outstanding IAC stock options were canceled and replaced with equity denominated in various subsidiaries of The Match Group.
891103_15_ITEM8_P144_S7	The incremental expense associated with this modification is $7.4 million .
891103_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Stock Units RSUs and PSUs are awards in the form of phantom shares or units, denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of IAC common stock and with the value of each RSU and PSU equal to the fair value of IAC common stock at the date of grant.
891103_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	RSUs and PSUs may be settled in cash, stock or both, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
891103_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	Each RSU and PSU grant is subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests.
891103_15_ITEM8_P146_S1	PSUs also include performance-based vesting, where certain performance targets set at the time of grant must be achieved before an award vests.
891103_15_ITEM8_P146_S2	The Company recognizes expense for all RSUs and PSUs for which vesting is considered probable.
891103_15_ITEM8_P146_S3	For RSU grants, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_15_ITEM8_P146_S4	For PSU grants, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_15_ITEM8_P146_S5	Unvested RSUs and PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2014 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2014 are as follows:
891103_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) Included in the table are PSUs which vest at the end of two years in varying amounts depending upon certain performance conditions.
891103_15_ITEM8_P147_S1	The PSU table above includes these awards at their maximum potential payout.
891103_15_ITEM8_P147_S2	The weighted average fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 based on market prices of IAC's common stock on the grant date was $68.13 , $42.32 and $46.24 , respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P147_S3	The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $20.4 million , $14.5 million and $139.0 million , respectively.
891103_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	Equity Instruments Denominated in the Shares of Certain Subsidiaries IAC has granted stock options and phantom equity units, which are denominated in the equity of its subsidiaries, to employees and management of certain subsidiaries.
891103_15_ITEM8_P148_S1	These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events.
891103_15_ITEM8_P148_S2	In some cases, IAC has taken a preferred interest in the subsidiary with a face value equal to the subsidiary's acquisition price; or, when funding a start-up business, its investment cost, or a certain fixed other amount.
891103_15_ITEM8_P148_S3	In some cases, these preferred interests accrete interest or dividends at a prescribed rate of return.
891103_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	The value of the stock options and phantom equity units is tied to the value of the common stock of the entity, with the equity awards employees and management receive as a whole generally representing a small minority of the total common stock outstanding.
891103_15_ITEM8_P149_S1	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the preferred interest (including the accretion of interest or dividends), our investment cost or other fixed amount or, in the case of stock options, the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_15_ITEM8_P149_S2	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_15_ITEM8_P149_S3	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock or cash at the option of IAC, with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration, at various dates through 2024.
891103_15_ITEM8_P149_S4	The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is expensed as non-cash compensation over the vesting term.
891103_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	interests, at December 31, 2014 is 5.8 million shares, which is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share if the effect is dilutive.
891103_15_ITEM8_P150_S1	The comparable amount at December 31, 2013 is 1.8 million shares.
891103_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker views the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_15_ITEM8_P151_S1	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of the eCommerce reportable segment, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate operating segments.
891103_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) The Company's primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding: (1) non-cash compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and goodwill and intangible asset impairments and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_15_ITEM8_P152_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_15_ITEM8_P152_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments.
891103_15_ITEM8_P152_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_15_ITEM8_P153_S1	(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.
891103_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	Revenue by geography is based on where the customer is located.
891103_15_ITEM8_P154_S1	Geographic information about revenue and long-lived assets is presented below:

891103_15_ITEM8_P157_S2	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement.
891103_15_ITEM8_P157_S3	These operating expenses are not included in the table below.
891103_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	Future minimum payments under operating lease agreements are as follows:

891103_15_ITEM8_P159_S1	The Company's most significant operating lease is a seventy-seven year land lease for IAC's headquarters building in New York City and approximates 55% of the future minimum payments due under all operating lease agreements in the table above.
891103_15_ITEM8_P159_S2	The Company also has funding commitments that could potentially require its performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events as follows:
891103_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments, which commitments are reducible or terminable such that these commitments can never exceed associated revenue by a meaningful amount.

891103_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	NOTE 15 CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits.
891103_15_ITEM8_P161_S1	The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
891103_15_ITEM8_P161_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_15_ITEM8_P161_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_15_ITEM8_P161_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss.
891103_15_ITEM8_P161_S5	It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.

891103_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	In making this assessment, our management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in "Internal Control Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Based on this assessment, management has determined that, as of December 31, 2014, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P2_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, included herein.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its internal control over financial reporting in order to improve its overall effectiveness.

891103_15_ITEM9A_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
891103_15_ITEM9A_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

891103_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our History IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc.
891103_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally, to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company.
891103_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	From 1997 through 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com) and Expedia, as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies.
891103_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	In 2002, the Company contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, a joint venture, and sold its interests in that venture to NBC Universal in 2005.
891103_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	In 2003, the Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire).

891103_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2008, IAC separated into five publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster and Tree.com, Inc.
891103_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	In 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic S.A. (now known as Meetic S.A.S. ( Meetic )), a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a 5 million note.
891103_16_ITEM1_P2_S4	In 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation s equity stake in IAC.
891103_16_ITEM1_P2_S5	In 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%.
891103_16_ITEM1_P2_S6	In 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic, ValueClick s owned and operated website businesses, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, and The Princeton Review.

891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Through Match Group, we operate a dating business that consists of a portfolio with over 45 brands, available in 38 languages, and offered in over 190 countries, including the following key brands: Match, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish, Tinder, Meetic, Twoo, OurTime, BlackPeopleMeet and FriendScout24.
891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	We operate a North America dating business, which includes Match, Chemistry, People Media, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid, Tinder and other dating businesses operating within the United States and Canada, and an International dating business, which includes Meetic, the international operations of PlentyOfFish and Tinder and all other dating businesses operating outside of the United States and Canada.
891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	All of our dating products enable a user to establish a profile and review other people s profiles without charge.
891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	Each of them also offers additional features, some of which are free, and some of which require payment depending on the particular product.
891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	In general, access to premium features requires a paid membership, which is typically offered in packages from one month to 12 months, depending on the product and circumstance.
891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S5	Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of membership purchased, by the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access, and by whether or not a customer is taking advantage of any special offers.
891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S6	In addition to paid memberships, many of our dating products, such as Match, Meetic and OkCupid, offer users the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time, or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other members, and these features are offered on a pay per use basis.
891103_16_ITEM1_P5_S7	The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand by brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
891103_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	In addition to our dating business, we also operate a non dating business through Match Group s ownership of The Princeton Review, which provides a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services.
891103_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Princeton Review includes Tutor.com (acquired in 2012) and The Princeton Review (acquired in 2014).
891103_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Substantially all of the Match Group segment s revenue is attributable to the dating business and substantially all dating revenue is derived directly from users.
891103_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	The significant majority of that revenue comes from recurring membership fees, which typically provide unlimited access to a bundle of features for a specific period of time, and the balance from la carte features, where users pay a fee for a specific action or event.
891103_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	Each brand offers a combination of free and paid features targeted to its unique community.
891103_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	In addition to direct revenue from users, dating revenue is derived from online advertising.
891103_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Substantially all of non-dating revenue is derived directly from students.
891103_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Marketing We attract the majority of users of our dating products through word of mouth and other free channels.
891103_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	In addition, many of our brands rely on paid customer acquisition for a significant percentage of their users.
891103_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns and business development or partnership deals.
891103_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts, as well as events.
891103_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Competition The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand.
891103_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We compete primarily with other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products, including eHarmony, Spark Networks (Jdate, ChristianMingle), Zoosk, Parship, ElitePartner, e Darling and Badoo.
891103_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	In addition to other online dating brands, we compete indirectly with offline dating services, such as in person matchmakers, and social media platforms.
891103_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	Arguably, our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other, and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services.
891103_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	the design and functionality of our dating products.
891103_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	HomeAdvisor Overview HomeAdvisor is a leading nationwide home services digital marketplace that helps connect consumers with home professionals in the United States, as well as in France and the Netherlands under various brands.
891103_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	HomeAdvisor connects consumers, by way of proprietary and patented technologies, with home services professionals, most of whom are pre-screened and customer rated.
891103_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	As of December 31, 2015, HomeAdvisor s domestic network of home services professionals consisted of approximately 102,000 paying service professionals in the United States providing services in more than 500 categories ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling projects.
891103_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	HomeAdvisor generated 9.8 million domestic service requests from homeowners during the year ended December 31, 2015.
891103_16_ITEM1_P13_S4	HomeAdvisor also operates Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service, and mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud based field service software for small to mid-size businesses.
891103_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	When a consumer submits a request through the HomeAdvisor marketplace, we generally match that consumer with up to four home services professionals from our network based on the type of services desired and the consumer s location.
891103_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Consumers can then review profiles of home services professionals with whom they have been matched and select the professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs.
891103_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	In addition to (or in lieu of) submitting a request through our marketplace, consumers can also search, select and contact home service professionals directly through our online directory.
891103_16_ITEM1_P14_S3	In all cases, the consumer is under no obligation to work with home service professionals referred by or found through HomeAdvisor.
891103_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	In 2015, HomeAdvisor introduced two on-demand services to complement its matching services: Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending).
891103_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Through Instant Booking, consumers can schedule appointments for select home tasks on-demand with a pre-screened home professional instantly across our platforms (website or mobile application), and through Instant Connect, consumers can connect with a home service professional instantly via phone.
891103_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access our free, online CostGuide, which provides project cost information for more than 250 project types on a local basis, as well as an online library of service related resources, which primarily includes articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with home services professionals.
891103_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	Consumers can also access all HomeAdvisor services and tools on iOS and Android devices, including the Apple Watch , through HomeAdvisor's mobile application.
891103_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	We offer various annual subscription products for home services professionals.
891103_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	The basic membership package includes membership in our network of home services professionals, as well as a listing in our online directory.
891103_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	Additional membership packages include all of the basic membership package services, plus matches through the marketplace and, in the case of one package, custom website and mobile development and hosting services, as well as integration with mHelpDesk.
891103_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Home services professionals who are new to HomeAdvisor must generally sign up for one of the annual subscription products described above.
891103_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	As of December 31, 2015, approximately 93% of the approximately 102,000 domestic paying service professionals within our network had purchased a membership package.
891103_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	The HomeAdvisor segment s revenue is primarily derived from fees paid by home services professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service), subscription fees and fees for website hosting services.
891103_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Fees for matches vary based upon the service requested and where the service is provided.
891103_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Marketing We market our services to consumers primarily through television advertising, as well as search engine marketing and through affiliate agreements with third parties.
891103_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and those of our home services professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website (on a cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to our website (on a cost-per-click basis).
891103_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also market our services to consumers through e-mails, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through direct mail and radio advertising.
891103_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	We market our subscription packages to home services professionals primarily through our sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations.
891103_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	Competition We compete with home services-related lead generation services, as well as Internet search engines and directories and with other forms of local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories.
891103_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services.
891103_16_ITEM1_P19_S6	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	our ability to build and maintain awareness of (and loyalty to) the HomeAdvisor brand.
891103_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	our Ask Other business, which includes Ask.com, CityGrid, ASKfm and a labs division focused on accelerating growth for the portfolio of websites within the Publishing segment and incubating new digital publishing sites in emerging verticals.
891103_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our Publishing businesses publish digital content and/or provide search services to users.
891103_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	Those of our Publishing businesses that publish digital content (our Premium Brands) generate such content through various sources, including, for example, through a network of approximately 850 experts as of December 31, 2015 in the case of About.com and internal editorial staff in the case of The Daily Beast, and/or acquire such content (or the rights to publish such content) from third parties.
891103_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	Those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services (Ask Other businesses and About.com, Dictionary.com and Investopedia through search boxes embedded within their websites) generally generate and display of a set of algorithmic search results, or hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users.
891103_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries.
891103_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites.
891103_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by advertisers.
891103_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	The paid listings displayed by our Publishing businesses are supplied to us by Google Inc.
891103_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	( Google ) pursuant to a services agreement, which expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_16_ITEM1_P23_S4	Following the expiration of this agreement, a new services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2020, will take effect.
891103_16_ITEM1_P23_S5	The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
891103_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Our Premium Brands business primarily consists of the following destination websites:
891103_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Daily Beast, a website dedicated to news, commentary, culture and entertainment that curates and publishes existing and original online content from its own roster of contributors in the United States.
891103_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	Collectively, our Premium Brands business was one of the largest digital publishers in the world during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, having reached more than 100 million U.S. users a month during this period.
891103_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	Ask Other Our Ask Other business consists of:
891103_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	a labs division focused on accelerating growth for its portfolio of websites and incubating new digital publishing sites in emerging verticals.
891103_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Publishing segment's revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, display advertisements and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications.
891103_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	The substantial majority of the paid listings that our Publishing businesses display are supplied to us by Google pursuant to our services agreement with Google.
891103_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results.
891103_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages.
891103_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Publishing businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us.
891103_16_ITEM1_P30_S2	We recognize paid listing revenue from Google when it delivers the user's click.
891103_16_ITEM1_P30_S3	In cases where the user s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs.
891103_16_ITEM1_P30_S4	See Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers to our Publishing businesses.
891103_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	In terms of publishing digital content, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results in relevant vertical categories and social channels.
891103_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	In terms of providing search services, generally our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications).
891103_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Publishing businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	We believe that the ability of our Publishing businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon:
891103_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	our continued ability to differentiate Ask.com from its competitors through question and answer services that endeavors to provide accurate, authoritative and direct answers to natural language questions (in the form of algorithmic search results and/or responses from other Ask.com users, as well as indexed question and answer pairings from various websites and online services), as well as our ability to attract advertisers to this initiative.

891103_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risk Factors Mr. Diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting and/or investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	As a result, Mr. Diller and his family are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	As of January 29, 2016, Mr. Diller owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock and 136,711 shares of IAC common stock.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	As of this date, Mr. Diller had sole voting and sole investment power with respect to these IAC securities and the shares of IAC Class B common stock held by Mr. Diller represented 100% of IAC s outstanding Class B common stock and, together with the shares of IAC common stock held by Mr. Diller, represented approximately 42.9% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Mr. Diller also holds 300,000 vested options and 1,000,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	As discussed in Item 1-Business-Equity Ownership and Vote, on February 22, 2016, in connection with the long-term estate planning of Mr. Diller and his family, Mr. Diller transferred all of his IAC Class B and common stock holdings to the 2016 GRATs and the 2016 Family Trust.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Each of Mr. Diller and Ms. von Furstenberg has sole voting and investment power, respectively, over the IAC securities in the 2016 GRATs, and Mr. von Furstenberg has sole voting and sole investment power over the IAC securities in the Family Trust.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or IAC common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including by way of sole investment power over the IAC securities in the 2016 GRATs), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve month period.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	While Mr. Diller may not currently exercise this right, no assurances can be given that this right will not become exercisable in the future, and if so, that Mr. Diller will consent to any of the limited matters at such time, in which case IAC would not be able to engage in transactions or take actions covered by this consent right.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As a result of Mr. Diller s sole investment power over the IAC securities in the 2016 GRATs, Ms. von Furstenberg s sole voting power over the IAC securities in the 2016 GRATs, Mr. von Furstenberg s sole voting and sole investment power over the IAC securities in the 2016 Family Trust and Mr. Diller s contractual rights described above, Mr. Diller and his family are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In addition, this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Effective succession planning is also important to our future success.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S7	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Publishing and Applications properties.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S9	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search related services.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Our current agreement with Google expires on March 31, 2016.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S11	Following the expiration of this agreement, a new services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2020, will take effect.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P7_S12	The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to advertisers) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Publishing and Applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to users) of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Changes to the amount Google charges to advertisers, Google s paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our Publishing and Applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Our services agreement with Google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its brands and services, including with respect to which products and applications may access Google's services, and the manner in which Google s paid listings are displayed within search results across various platforms and products.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Google may generally unilaterally update its own policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Noncompliance with Google s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could, if not cured, result in Google s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners or the termination of the services agreement by Google.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S9	The termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of IAC s rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S10	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P8_S11	General economic events or trends, particularly those that reduce advertising spending and/or adversely impact consumer confidence, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue (primarily revenue from our Publishing and Applications segments) is attributable to online advertising.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Similarly, some of our businesses (primarily HomeAdvisor) are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For example, in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions, consumer confidence, spending levels and credit availability could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	The occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects, which could result in a decrease in fees paid by home service professionals for consumer matches, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We could also experience turnover in our network of home services professionals given that a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, and as such, are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Any turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to our properties and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Our success depends upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the Internet.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P10_S8	We continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	advertising), the continued growth in commercial use of the Internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to changes in laws, changes in industry practices, the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We depend, in part, upon third parties to drive traffic to our various properties and distribute our products and services.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our success depends, in part, upon third parties driving traffic to our various properties (desktop and mobile) and distributing our products and services.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	We distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	For example, certain of the businesses within our Publishing and Applications segments have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute search boxes, toolbars, browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Most of these agreements are either non exclusive and short term in nature or, in the case of long term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our Partnerships business.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	The inability of these businesses to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute search boxes, toolbars, browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various properties, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S9	In addition, as our users and customers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications, we (primarily in the case of Match Group s dating business and Apalon, one of the businesses within our Applications segment) increasingly depend upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S10	Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications, and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our mobile applications through their stores.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S11	We cannot assure you that Apple or Google will not limit or eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P11_S12	If either or both of them did so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In connection with our search engine optimization, or SEO, efforts, we rely on third party search engines to drive traffic to our various properties (desktop and mobile).
891103_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	SEO efforts involve developing websites to rank well within search engine results.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of search results.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If we fail to successfully manage SEO efforts across our businesses, including the timely modification of SEO efforts from time to time in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms, search query trends and related actions by providers of search services designed to ensure the display of unique offerings in search results (which actions by search service providers may result in algorithmic listings being displayed less prominently within search engine results), could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various properties, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Certain of our businesses engage in similar efforts involving Facebook and other social media platforms (for example, developing content designed to appear higher in a given Facebook News Feed and generate "likes") that involve challenges and risks similar to those faced in connection with our SEO efforts.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Also, search engines continue to expand their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various properties, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Lastly, we rely on Facebook to distribute one of Match Group's dating products, Tinder.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Users currently register for (and log in to) Tinder exclusively through their Facebook profiles.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the use of its platform in this manner and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use Facebook in this manner and if Facebook did so, Match Group s (and in turn, our) business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	and other related efforts, and are dependent, in part, on our ability to effectively communicate with our users and customers via current and new means of communication.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to introduce new and enhanced content, products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and that otherwise resonate with our users and customers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Even if we succeed in our traffic building and distribution efforts, we may not be able to convert traffic into repeat users and customers unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced content, products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with our users and customers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The development of new content, products and services, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, require significant time and resources.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new content, products and services or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately and efficiently could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In the case of certain of our applications, third parties have introduced (and continue to introduce) technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our applications generally or otherwise make users less likely to use our services (such as through the introduction of features and/or processes that disproportionately and adversely impact the ability of consumers to access and use our services relative to those of our competitors).
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	In addition, there are technologies that interfere with the functionality of (or settings changes made by) our applications.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	For example, there are technologies that interfere with search boxes embedded within our toolbars and the maintenance of home page and web browser search settings previously selected by our users.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	These technologies, applications and policies adversely impact our ability to generate search queries through our applications, which in turn adversely impacts our revenues.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Technologies have also been introduced that can block the display of online advertisements across platforms (particularly and increasingly in the case with mobile platforms) and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our failure to successfully modify our websites and products in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of these new technologies, or our failure to find alternative sources of revenue to support websites and products that currently generate revenue through advertising, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, we may not be able to adapt quickly and/or in a cost-effective manner to frequent changes in user and customer preferences, which can be difficult to predict, or appropriately time the introduction of enhancements and/or new content, products or services to the market in response to such changes.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our inability to provide quality content, products and services would adversely affect user and customer experiences, which would result in decreases in users, customers and revenues and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	For example, in the case of About.com , we rely on independent, freelance subject matter experts to generate quality content for our users.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	If we fail to recruit and retain such experts generally and/or the experts ultimately retained cannot provide us with quality content in a cost-effective manner, the experience of our users would be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Lastly, while the continued introduction of new content, products and services is critical to our success, by definition, new content, products and services have limited operating histories, which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our current business and future prospects.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	For example, through Match Group, we seek to tailor each of our dating products to meet the preferences of specific communities of users.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Building a given dating product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Although certain of our newer dating products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time, the historical growth rates of these dating products are not necessarily an indicator of future growth rates for our newer dating products generally.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We have encountered, and may continue to encounter, risks and difficulties as we build new content, brands and products.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The failure to successfully address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Historically, we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and customers and sustain our growth.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In the case of paid advertising generally, our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller, publisher of advertising (including through search engines and social networks and platforms) or marketing affiliate.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	As a result, any such third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	For example, providers of online search advertising services (including Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!) may limit our ability to market our products and services through their advertising services, whether due to their policies, competitive reasons or otherwise.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Other publishers and channels have, from time to time, limited or prohibited advertisements for Match Group's dating products for a variety of reasons, including as a result of poor behavior by other dating industry participants.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We cannot assure you that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the case of our dating or any of our other businesses in the future.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	If this were to happen in the case of a significant marketing channel and/or for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In addition, if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers, publishers of advertising or marketing affiliates, our advertisements could be removed without notice and/or our accounts could be suspended or terminated, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	without advance notice), could adversely affect both the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase and the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally, which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Separately, evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of cost-effective marketing opportunities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S10	For example, as traditional television viewership declines and consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers, the reach of many of traditional online and offline advertising channels is contracting.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S11	To continue to reach potential users and customers, we must continue to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels, such as mobile and online video platforms.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Generally, the opportunities in (and sophistication of) newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to opportunities in traditional online and offline channels and if we are unable to continue to appropriately manage and fine tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P21_S13	In addition, as the distribution of our products and services through certain channels increases, in order to maintain our profit margins, we may need to offset increasing related fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures, which could adversely affect our marketing efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As discussed above, as our user and customers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications, we (primarily Match Group s dating business) increasingly rely upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For example, while our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores, we offer our users the opportunity to purchase paid memberships and certain la carte features through these applications.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We determine the prices at which these memberships and features are sold and, in exchange for facilitating the purchase of these memberships and features through these applications to users who download our applications from these stores, we pay Apple and Google, as applicable, a share (currently 30%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	As the distribution of our dating and other products and services through app stores increases, we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue, increasing user volume or monetization per user, or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Lastly, as discussed above, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various websites and mobile applications, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Any failure to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Communicating with our users via e-mail is critical to our success, and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations .
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	As consumer habits evolve in the era of smart phones and messaging/social networking apps, usage of e-mail, particularly among our younger users and customers, has declined.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, deliverability restrictions imposed by third party e-mail providers could limit or prevent our ability to send e-mails to our users and customers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Primarily in the case of Match Group s dating business, one of our primary means of communicating with users and customers and keeping them engaged with our products and services is via e-mail.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Any erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with our users and customers via e-mail could have an adverse impact on user and customer experience and, in the case of Match Group s dating businesses, the rate at which non paying users become paid members.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	While we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with our users and customers (for example, through push notifications), we cannot assure you that such alternative means of communication will be as effective as e-mail has been historically.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to build, maintain and/or enhance our various brands.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of highly-recognizable brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries, as well as a number of fledgling brands that we are in the process of building.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We believe that our success depends, in part, upon our continuing ability to maintain and enhance our established brands, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) our fledgling brands.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S9	Our brands and brand-building efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Moreover, the failure to market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the Internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact our various brands and brand-building efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P24_S11	Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We operate in various international markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, approximately 31% and 26% of our total revenue, respectively, were international revenue.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars affects the period over period comparability of our U.S dollar denominated operating results.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Historically, we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our international operations continued growth and expansion into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	These fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S5	While many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S6	While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services (and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices) and intend to continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our non-mobile products and services.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S7	In addition, the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of users and customers to mobile devices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Through Match Group, we own, operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for, and revenue generation from, that product s community of users.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	In general, the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity and quality of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P29_S6	To succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services; any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Any such interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services, tarnish our brands reputation and decrease demand for our products and services, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S6	We also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experiences of our users and customers, accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our properties and to keep up with changes in technology and user and customer preferences.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services and thereby negatively impact demand for our products and services, and could increase our costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S8	For example, we are currently in the process of an ongoing consolidation and streamlining of the technology and network systems and infrastructures of a number of our dating businesses, including Match, OurTime and Meetic.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S9	The goal of this project is to modernize, optimize and improve the scalability and cost effectiveness of these systems and infrastructures and to increase our ability to deploy product changes more rapidly across devices and product lines.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S10	We have budgeted significant human and financial resources for these efforts and if we experience delays, inefficiencies and/or operational failures, we will incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our profitability.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S11	Moreover, these efforts may not be successful, may not be completed in a timely or cost effective manner, may not result in the cost savings or other benefits we anticipate and may disrupt operations, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S12	We also rely on third party computer systems, data centers, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S13	We have no control over any of these third parties or their operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S14	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, changes in service levels provided by these systems or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P30_S15	If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We may not be able to protect our systems, infrastructures and technologies from cyber attacks.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyber attacks experienced by third parties.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Any disruption of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, or compromise of our user data or other information, due to cyber attacks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technology-related events, such as cyber attacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks, attempts to misappropriate customer information (including credit card information) or other malicious activities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	The incidence of events of this nature (or any combination thereof) is on the rise worldwide.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	While we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses, and have invested heavily in these efforts and related training, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur, that it will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Furthermore, we may become the victim of security breaches, such as the misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of user, customer or vendor data maintained in our information technology systems or those of third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations), which could have a similar effect on us.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Any cyber attack or security breach we experience could prevent us from providing our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as result in a degradation of our products and services and/or cause damage to our systems, infrastructures, technologies and data.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) could have a similar effect.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S10	Moreover, even cyber attacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S11	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P31_S12	If the security of personal and confidential user information, including credit card information, that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event, our reputation could be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We receive, process, store and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential information, including credit card information, and enable our users to share their personal information with each other.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In some cases, we retain third party vendors to store this information.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of this information, but cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If any such event were to occur, we may not be able to remedy the event, and we may have to expend significant capital and resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If a breach of our security (or the security of our vendors and partners) occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the recognition of our various brands and their competitive positions could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Our businesses accept payment from our users primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S7	The ability of these businesses to access credit card information on a real time basis without having to proactively reach out to the consumer each time they process a payment for products and services (including auto renewal payments or payments for the purchase of a premium feature on or with any of our products or services) is critical to our success.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S8	When we experience (or a third party experiences) a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S9	In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P32_S10	To the extent our users are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party, affected users would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant user effort.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Additionally, if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card related costs and substantial remediation costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Finally, the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge consumers for recurring membership payments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Examples include the European Union Data Protection Directive (as adopted and implemented by the various European Union member states, the "EU Directive"), various U.S. state regulations concerning minimum data security standards, industry self-regulating principles that have become standard practice and more stringent contractual protections (and related compliance obligations) regarding privacy and data security.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In addition, if an online service provider fails to comply with its privacy policy, it could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for unfair or deceptive practices brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act (and/or brought by a state attorney general pursuant to a similar state law), as well as a private lawsuit under various U.S. federal and state laws.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Similarly, in the European Union, the online service provider could become subject to an investigation and/or proceeding for the violation of the data protection laws and regulations brought by a member state or its supervisory authority (an independent body charged with monitoring compliance with data protection laws), as well as private causes of action under the EU Directive.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In general, personal information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world (particularly in the European Union), the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	U.S. and foreign legislators and regulators may enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	For example, in January 2016, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission released a report that further explored the use of big data and its impact on American consumers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	This report followed the May 2014 White House release of a review of "big data" practices, which called for an update to U.S. privacy laws based on the proposed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights released by the White House in February 2012 and the enactment of a federal data breach notification law.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P36_S4	In addition, in February 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a report seeking changes in Internet and mobile privacy protection and disclosures.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Similarly, new privacy laws and regulations at the state level, as well as new laws and directives abroad (particularly in the European Union), are being proposed and implemented.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P36_S6	For example, effective January 1, 2016, the Delaware Online Privacy and Protection Act requires companies to make new and enhanced disclosures regarding their privacy policies and since 2014, California law has required companies that collect personal information to disclose how they respond to web browser Do Not Track signals.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The European Union is in the process of adopting new guidelines (the proposed European Data Protection Regulation) for data protection and privacy to address recent globalization and technological developments, which will supersede the EU Directive.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, in October 2015, the European Union s highest court ruled that the EU-US Safe Harbor Agreement, which had provided a framework for transfers of personal data from European Union member states to the United States, was invalid.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In February 2016, the European Commission and the United States reached an agreement on a proposed new framework for transfers of personal data, the EU-US Privacy Shield.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	This proposed new framework is expected to impose a stricter compliance regime for companies seeking to transfer personal data from European Union member states to the United States and require stronger monitoring by U.S. regulators of the sharing, use, disclosure and protection of such data and related enforcement for non-compliance.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	transferring personal data from European Union member states to the United States given that the EU-US Privacy Shield is not yet final and faces hurdles to adoption and the European Commission did not provide any interim guidance.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, existing privacy laws that were intended for brick-and-mortar businesses could be interpreted in a manner that would extend their reach to our businesses.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws) in this area may make it more costly to operate our businesses and/or limit our ability to engage in certain types of activities, such as targeted advertising, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	As privacy and data protection have become more sensitive issues, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of consumer and other user data collected by our businesses.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Also, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In the case of security breaches involving personal credit card data, credit card companies could curtail our ability to transact payments and impose fines for failure to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Moreover, any such breach could decrease consumer confidence in the case of the business that experienced the breach or our businesses generally, which would decrease traffic to (and in turn, usage and transactions on) the relevant website and/or our various websites and which in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	The failure of any of our businesses, or their various third party vendors and service providers, to comply with applicable privacy policies, federal, state or foreign privacy laws and regulations or PCI standards, as well as the unauthorized release of personal information or other user data for any reason, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	While we believe that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations, standard and practices or that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Any failure or perceived failure by us (or the third parties with whom we have contracted to store such information) to comply with applicable privacy laws, privacy policies or privacy related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information may result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S7	In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S8	We may not freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S9	The Company's potential sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, availability under IAC's revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales, including marketable securities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P39_S10	The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including IAC.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In addition, because Match Group is a separate and distinct legal entity with public shareholders, it has no obligation to provide us with funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.8 billion, including $1.2 billion of total debt outstanding at Match Group ($40 million of which matures in the current year).
891103_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As of this date, we had borrowing availability of $300 million, and Match Group had borrowing availability of $500 million, under our respective revolving credit facilities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Neither Match Group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of IAC or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Similarly, neither IAC nor any of its subsidiaries (other than Match Group and its subsidiaries) guarantee any indebtedness of Match Group or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our indebtedness and Match Group's indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:
891103_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	limiting our respective abilities to react to changing market conditions in the various industries in which we do business.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	In addition to our respective debt service obligations, our and Match Group s operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our ability or the ability of Match Group to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses, depends on our respective financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing our and Match Group s indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Although the terms of agreements governing our and Match Group s indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	If new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries current debt levels, the risks described above could increase.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our current and planned indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our ability and the ability of Match Group to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:
891103_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	our future ability and the future ability of Match Group to borrow under our respective revolving credit agreements, the availability of which will depend on, among other things, compliance with the covenants in the then existing agreements governing such indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There can be no assurance that our business or Match Group will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we or Match Group will be able to draw under our respective revolving credit agreements or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	See also "-We may not freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries" above.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S4	In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S5	In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, and/or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S7	The agreements governing our and Match Group s indebtedness may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The agreements governing our and Match Group s indebtedness contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and Match Group, including restrictions on the ability to, among other things:
891103_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	place restrictions on distributions from subsidiaries.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Any of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing current or future indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Upon a default, unless waived, lenders under our respective credit agreements could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our indebtedness and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Holders of our or Match Group s senior notes also have the ability to force us into bankruptcy or liquidation in certain circumstances, subject to the terms of the related indentures.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P54_S4	In addition, a default could trigger a cross default under our other agreements and could trigger a cross default under agreements governing our future indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Our operating results may not generate cash in an amount that would be sufficient to service our indebtedness or to fund our other expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	At December 31, 2015, Match Group has $800 million of indebtedness outstanding under its term loan facility, which bears interest at variable rates and currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00 %.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	LIBOR at December 31, 2015 for similar borrowings of three months was approximately 60 basis points.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Changes in the interest rates applicable to this indebtedness will expose us to interest rate risk.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S3	For example, if LIBOR were to increase by 100 basis points then the annual interest payments on this indebtedness would increase by 60 basis points, or $4.8 million in 2016.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S4	And if LIBOR decreased 60 basis points to zero, annual interest payments on this indebtedness would remain the same.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Such potential changes in interest payments take into account quarterly amortization payments and are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant rate of variable-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S6	To the extent that we or Match Group draw down on our respective revolving credit facilities in the future, any related indebtedness incurred would bear interest at variable rates, which would increase our exposure to interest rate risk.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S7	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we are able to do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S8	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S9	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S10	As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S11	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P56_S12	Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	successfully manage acquisition related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the Internet must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P59_S7	These additional risks include, among others:
891103_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	trade sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The occurrence of any or all of the events described above could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Laws that do reference the Internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S5	For example, through our various businesses we post and link to third party content, including third party advertisements, links and websites.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S6	We also allow users to submit content, such as comments, photographs and videos.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S7	We could be subject to liability for posting, hosting or linking to third party content, and while we generally require third parties to indemnify us for related claims, we may not be able to enforce our indemnification rights.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S8	Some laws, including the Communications Decency Act, or CDA, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, limit our liability for posting or linking to third party content.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S9	For example, the DMCA generally protects online service providers from claims of copyright infringement based on the storage of third party content at the direction of the user, so long as certain statutory requirements are satisfied.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S10	However, the scope and applicability of the DMCA are subject to judicial interpretation and, as such, remain uncertain, and the U.S. Congress may enact legislation affecting (and potentially limiting) the protections afforded by the DMCA to online service providers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S11	Moreover, similar protections may not exist in other jurisdictions in which our various businesses operate.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P61_S12	As a result, claims have been, and could be, threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws based upon use of third party content asserting, among other things, negligence, defamation, invasion of privacy or right or publicity, copyright infringement or trademark infringement.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Also, we send electronic messages to users through our various businesses, as well as develop, market and/or distribute a variety of downloadable applications through our Consumer and Partnerships businesses, which could subject us to liability for failing to comply with laws governing the sending of electronic messages to our users and the installation of downloadable applications.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	For example, Canada s Anti-Spam Legislation ( CASL ), which became effective on July 1, 2014, prohibits all commercial electronic messages (including e-mail, text, social media, sound and image messages) that are sent without proper consumer consent.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	And, effective January 15, 2015, the CASL restricts the unsolicited installation of computer programs and applications.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	While several Canadian regulators are jointly empowered to enforce and issue administrative and monetary penalties for CASL violations, effective July 1, 2017 individuals may also file private and class action lawsuits to collect statutory damages for CASL violations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	In addition, changing Internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P62_S5	One example of such changing practices is the increasing use of native advertising, a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P62_S6	The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online native advertising to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Lastly, one of the businesses within our Applications segment, SlimWare, operates a paid telephone technical support service, which it promotes, in part, through its software products.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	In the recent past and currently, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and various state regulatory agencies and attorneys general have been aggressively enforcing laws governing telephonic sales in the computer support industry.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	While SlimWare has put a related compliance program in place with the third party vendor who provides paid telephone technical support services on its behalf to ensure compliance with applicable laws, no assurances can be given that this program will be effective.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S3	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S5	While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S6	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S7	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S8	We rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S9	We also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2034.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S10	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S11	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S12	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S13	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S14	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S15	No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S16	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S17	Despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P64_S18	The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P68_S3	Our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P68_S5	The ultimate outcome of any such audits and reviews could be materially different from estimates and determinations reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.
891103_16_ITEM1A_P68_S6	Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	All of IAC's leases are at prevailing market rates.
891103_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	IAC believes that the duration of each lease is adequate.
891103_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	IAC believes that its principal properties, whether owned or leased, are currently adequate for the purposes for which they are used and are suitably maintained for these purposes.
891103_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	IAC does not anticipate any future problems renewing or obtaining suitable leases for any of its principal businesses.
891103_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	IAC's approximately 202,500 square foot corporate headquarters in New York, New York houses offices for IAC corporate and various IAC businesses within the following segments: Match Group, Publishing, Applications and Video.
891103_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the registrant's business) to which the registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve claims for damages for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
891103_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the judgment of Company management, none of the pending litigation matters which the Company and its subsidiaries are defending involves (or is likely to involve) amounts of that magnitude, nor do such matters involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to the Company's shareholders.
891103_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	There is no established public trading market for IAC Class B common stock.
891103_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth, for the calendar periods indicated, the high and low sales prices per share for IAC common stock as reported on NASDAQ.
891103_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 25, 2016, there were approximately 1,600 holders of record of the Company's common stock and the closing price of IAC common stock on NASDAQ was $44.31.
891103_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	Because the substantial majority of the outstanding shares of IAC common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, IAC is not able to estimate the total number of beneficial shareholders represented by these record holders.
891103_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	As of February 25, 2016, there were three holders of record of the Company's Class B common stock.
891103_16_ITEM5_P1_S3	In 2014, IAC's Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends, two of which were $0.24 per share of common and Class B common stock outstanding and two of which were $0.34 per share of common and Class B common stock outstanding.
891103_16_ITEM5_P1_S4	In 2015, IAC's Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends, all of which were $0.34 per share of common and Class B common stock outstanding.
891103_16_ITEM5_P1_S5	On February 2, 2016, IAC announced that following the completion of the Match Group initial public offering and related debt transactions, IAC's Board of Directors had suspended the Company's quarterly cash dividend program.

891103_16_ITEM7_P98_S15	Net cash provided by financing activities attributable to continuing operations in 2013 includes $500.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 2013 Senior Notes and excess tax benefits from stock-based awards of $32.9 million , partially offset by $264.2 million for the repurchase of 4.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $50.63 per share, $79.2 million related to the payment of cash dividends to IAC shareholders, $71.5 million held in escrow related to the Meetic tender offer, $67.9 million for the purchase of noncontrolling interests in Meetic and a subsidiary of HomeAdvisor, $15.8 million for the payment of our 2002 Senior Notes, which were due January 15, 2013, and $7.4 million of debt issuance costs associated with our 2013 Senior Notes.
891103_16_ITEM7_P99_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash flows generated from operations.
891103_16_ITEM7_P100_S0	IAC has a $300 million revolving credit facility that was amended and restated on October 7, 2015, and now expires on October 7, 2020 (the "IAC Credit Facility").
891103_16_ITEM7_P100_S1	The obligations under the IAC Credit Facility are secured by the stock of certain IAC domestic and foreign subsidiaries and unconditionally guaranteed by certain wholly-owned IAC domestic subsidiaries.
891103_16_ITEM7_P100_S2	At December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the IAC Credit Facility.
891103_16_ITEM7_P101_S0	On October 7, 2015, Match Group entered into a credit agreement (the "Match Group Credit Agreement") which provides for a five-year $500 million revolving credit facility (the "Match Group Credit Facility").
891103_16_ITEM7_P101_S1	At December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Match Group Credit Facility.
891103_16_ITEM7_P102_S0	On November 16, 2015, Match Group completed a private exchange offer to eligible holders to exchange any and all of the 2012 Senior Notes for up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of Match Group Senior Notes issued by Match Group ("Match Exchange Offer").
891103_16_ITEM7_P102_S1	Match Group exchanged $445.3 million of 2012 Senior Notes for $445.2 million of Match Group Senior Notes pursuant to the Match Exchange Offer.
891103_16_ITEM7_P102_S2	Promptly following the closing of the Match Exchange Offer, substantially all of the restrictive covenants of the 2012 Senior Notes were removed and Match Group and its subsidiaries were designated as unrestricted subsidiaries of IAC for purposes of the indentures governing the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes and the IAC Credit Facility.
891103_16_ITEM7_P102_S3	Following the designation, neither Match Group nor any of its subsidiaries guaranteed any debt of IAC, or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt.
891103_16_ITEM7_P103_S0	On November 16, 2015, Match Group amended and restated the Match Group Credit Agreement to provide for an $800 million, seven-year term loan.
891103_16_ITEM7_P103_S1	Principal payments of $10 million under the Match Group Term Loan are due quarterly through maturity, at which point a final principal payment of $530 million will become due.
891103_16_ITEM7_P103_S2	Additionally, the Match Group Term Loan may require additional annual principal payments as part of an excess cash flow sweep provision, the amount of which is governed by the net secured leverage ratio.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S0	The Match Group Term Loan bears interest, at its option, at either the base rate or LIBOR, plus 3.50% or 4.50% , respectively, with, in the case of LIBOR, a floor of 1.00% .
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S1	Interest payments are due no less than semi-annually through the term of the loan.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S2	The Match Group Term Loan and outstanding borrowings, if any, under the Match Group Credit Facility rank pari-passu with each other, and have priority over the Match Group Senior Notes.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S3	The indenture governing the 2013 Senior Notes restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event we are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S4	In addition, the terms of the IAC Credit Facility require that we maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.0 and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S5	The indenture governing the Match Group Senior Notes restricts Match Group's ability to incur additional indebtedness in the event they are not in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio of 5.0 to 1.0.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S6	Additionally, the terms of the Match Group Credit Facility require Match Group to maintain a leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 and a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50 to 1.00.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S7	As of December 31, 2015, IAC and Match Group were in compliance with all applicable covenants.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S8	There are additional covenants under the Match Group Credit Facility and the Match Group Term Loan that limit Match Group's ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions.
891103_16_ITEM7_P104_S9	While the Match Group Term Loan remains outstanding, these same covenants under the Match Group Credit Agreement are more restrictive than the covenants that are applicable to the Match Group Credit Facility.
891103_16_ITEM7_P105_S0	Obligations under the Match Group Credit Facility and Match Group Term Loan are unconditionally guaranteed by certain wholly-owned Match Group domestic subsidiaries, and are also secured by the stock of certain Match Group domestic and foreign subsidiaries.
891103_16_ITEM7_P105_S1	In addition, Match Group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds.
891103_16_ITEM7_P105_S2	As a result, we may not freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries.
891103_16_ITEM7_P106_S0	Match Group generated approximately 60%, 41% and 43% of the Company operating cash flow in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
891103_16_ITEM7_P107_S0	The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations.
891103_16_ITEM7_P107_S1	The Company expects that 2016 capital expenditures will be higher than 2015 by approximately 10% to 20%, driven by leasehold improvements related to a new lease for Match Group's corporate headquarters and HomeAdvisor's sales center expansion.
891103_16_ITEM7_P107_S2	At December 31, 2015, IAC had 5.6 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
891103_16_ITEM7_P108_S0	IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
891103_16_ITEM7_P108_S1	On February 2, 2016, IAC announced that it had suspended the quarterly cash dividend program.
891103_16_ITEM7_P108_S2	Future declarations of dividends are subject to the determination of IAC's Board of Directors.
891103_16_ITEM7_P109_S0	The Company believes its and Match Group's existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with their expected positive cash flows generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under their respective revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund their normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.
891103_16_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Company's and Match Group's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our respective products and services.
891103_16_ITEM7_P109_S2	The Company s indebtedness and Match Group s indebtedness could limit our respective abilities to: (i) obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditure or debt service or other requirements; and (ii) use operating cash flow to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, invest in other areas, such as developing properties and exploiting business opportunities.
891103_16_ITEM7_P109_S3	The Company may make additional acquisitions and investments and, as a result, the Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility.
891103_16_ITEM7_P109_S4	Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.
891103_16_ITEM7_P110_S0	The Company has excluded $41.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.
891103_16_ITEM7_P110_S1	For additional information on income taxes, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_16_ITEM7_P111_S0	(b) Represents contractual amounts due including interest on both fixed and variable rate instruments.
891103_16_ITEM7_P112_S0	Long-term debt at December 31, 2015 consists of $1.0 billion which bears interest at fixed rates and $800 million ("Match Group Term Loan") which bears interest at variable rates.
891103_16_ITEM7_P112_S1	The Match Group Term Loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%.
891103_16_ITEM7_P112_S2	The amount of interest ultimately paid on the Match Group Term Loan may differ based on changes in interest rates.
891103_16_ITEM7_P113_S0	(c) The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses.
891103_16_ITEM7_P113_S1	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement.
891103_16_ITEM7_P113_S2	These operating expenses are not included in the table above.
891103_16_ITEM7_P113_S3	(d) The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments.
891103_16_ITEM7_P114_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (e) Commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events.
891103_16_ITEM7_P115_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the items described above, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015.
891103_16_ITEM7_P116_S0	IAC'S PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING IAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_16_ITEM7_P117_S0	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_16_ITEM7_P117_S1	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_16_ITEM7_P117_S2	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_16_ITEM7_P117_S3	IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_16_ITEM7_P117_S4	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
891103_16_ITEM7_P118_S0	Definition of IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_16_ITEM7_P118_S1	We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_16_ITEM7_P118_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments.
891103_16_ITEM7_P118_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_16_ITEM7_P119_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_16_ITEM7_P120_S0	Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions, of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based RSUs.
891103_16_ITEM7_P120_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs are included only to the extent the performance criteria have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period).
891103_16_ITEM7_P120_S2	Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_16_ITEM7_P121_S0	Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives.
891103_16_ITEM7_P121_S1	Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions.
891103_16_ITEM7_P122_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_16_ITEM7_P122_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_16_ITEM7_P123_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_16_ITEM7_P123_S1	We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_16_ITEM7_P124_S0	Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value.
891103_16_ITEM7_P124_S1	These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_16_ITEM7_P125_S0	RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss) by reportable segment and to net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
891103_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
891103_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
891103_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_16_ITEM7_P130_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_16_ITEM7_P130_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_16_ITEM7_P130_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S0	In connection with some business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S1	Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S2	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics such as monthly active users.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S3	The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S4	Determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S5	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S6	The changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_16_ITEM7_P131_S7	See Note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_16_ITEM7_P132_S0	Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_16_ITEM7_P132_S1	The annual assessments identified impairment charges in 2015 related to the Publishing and ShoeBuy reporting units.
891103_16_ITEM7_P132_S2	The 2014 and 2013 annual assessments identified no material impairments.
891103_16_ITEM7_P132_S3	The value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that is subject to annual assessment for impairment is $2.2 billion and $380.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015.
891103_16_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2015, a quantitative assessment of the Match Group, Publishing, Applications, ShoeBuy and P riceRunner reporting units' goodwill was performed.
891103_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	A qualitative assessment of the HomeAdvisor, Connected Ventur es, and DailyBurn reporting units' goodwill was performed.
891103_16_ITEM7_P134_S2	When the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise goodwill must be tested for impairment using a two-step process.
891103_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	The first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach.
891103_16_ITEM7_P135_S2	Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_16_ITEM7_P136_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on the reporting units' current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_16_ITEM7_P136_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 12% to 22% in 2015 and 13% to 19% in 2014.
891103_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies.
891103_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.
891103_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
891103_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
891103_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
891103_16_ITEM7_P139_S2	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
891103_16_ITEM7_P139_S3	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
891103_16_ITEM7_P139_S4	In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid.
891103_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	Any impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based upon the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value using the second step of the impairment analysis that is described above but, in any event, would not be expected to be lower than the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
891103_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	A primary driver in the DCF valuation analyses and the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability.
891103_16_ITEM7_P141_S1	Generally, the Company would expect an impairment if forecasted revenue and profitability are no longer expected to be achieved and as a result, the carrying value of a reporting unit(s) exceeds its fair value.
891103_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	This assessment would be based, in part, upon the performance of its businesses relative to budget, the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	At October 1, 2015, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20% with the exception of Publishing and ShoeBuy.
891103_16_ITEM7_P142_S2	To illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment charge relative to future changes in estimated fair value, had the estimated fair value of Publishing and ShoeBuy been hypothetically lower by 10% and 20% as of October 1, 2015, the carrying value of Publishing would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $20 million and $60 million, respectively, and the carrying value of ShoeBuy would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $1 million and $5 million, respectively.
891103_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	While the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1.
891103_16_ITEM7_P143_S1	The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_16_ITEM7_P143_S2	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_16_ITEM7_P145_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_16_ITEM7_P145_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in 2015 and 10% to 20% in 2014, and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2015 and 2014.
891103_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_16_ITEM7_P146_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	During 2013 the Company wrote off certain capitalized software costs.
891103_16_ITEM7_P147_S1	The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $363.5 million at December 31, 2015.
891103_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	Income Taxes We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process.
891103_16_ITEM7_P148_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_16_ITEM7_P148_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_16_ITEM7_P148_S3	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	At December 31, 2015, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $43.4 million, including interest.
891103_16_ITEM7_P150_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_16_ITEM7_P151_S1	The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_16_ITEM7_P151_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_16_ITEM7_P151_S3	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_16_ITEM7_P151_S4	As of December 31, 2015, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $346.8 million.
891103_16_ITEM7_P151_S5	Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	Stock-Based Compensation As disclosed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2015, 2014 and 2013 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model.
891103_16_ITEM7_P152_S1	For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term.
891103_16_ITEM7_P152_S2	The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $4.6 million, $21.2 million and $10.3 million, respectively.
891103_16_ITEM7_P152_S3	The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, assuming a zero dividend yield on the outstanding options, would be an increase of $3.2 million.
891103_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs.
891103_16_ITEM7_P153_S1	For RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term.
891103_16_ITEM7_P153_S2	For performance-based RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	Marketable Securities and Long-term Investments At December 31, 2015, marketable securities consist of short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S1	Long-term investments include equity securities accounted for under the equity and cost methods and marketable equity securities.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S2	The Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S3	The Company also invests in marketable equity securities as part of its investment strategy.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S4	Marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S5	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S6	The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S7	Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S8	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S9	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S10	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S11	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_16_ITEM7_P154_S12	During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $6.7 million, $66.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively, related to cost method investments.
891103_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and long-term debt, including current maturities.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which consist of money market funds, short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	During the second quarter of 2015, the Company recognized $0.3 million in losses that were deemed to be other-than-temporary related to various corporate debt securities that were expected to be sold by the Company, in part, to fund its cash needs related to Match Group's acquisition of PlentyOfFish.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	During 2014 and 2013, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 2015, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by $0.3 million.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Conversely, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of $1.5 billion was invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S5	At December 31, 2015, the Company's outstanding debt was $1.8 billion , including $40.0 million of current maturities, of which $1.0 billion bears interest at fixed rates and $800 million bears interest at variable rates.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S6	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S7	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $40.9 million.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P2_S8	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The Match Group Term Loan currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 4.50%, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	LIBOR at December 31, 2015 for similar borrowings of three months was approximately 60 basis points.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	If LIBOR were to increase by 100 basis points then the annual interest payments on the Match Group Term Loan would increase by 60 basis points, or $4.8 million in 2016.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	If LIBOR decreased 60 basis points to zero, annual interest payments on the Match Group Term Loan would remain the same.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Such potential changes in interest payments are based on quarterly amortization and certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant rate of variable-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, international revenue accounted for 26% of consolidated revenue.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The average Euro versus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 16% lower in 2015 than 2014.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The decrease had a significant impact to the revenue of Match Group.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2015, Match Group revenue, Dating revenue and Dating International revenue would have increased approximately 20%, 15% and 21%, respectively, as compared to the reported increases of 15%, 9% and 3%, respectively, had the foreign currency exchange rates been the same as 2014.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S5	Foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to the Company's earnings in 2015, 2014 and 2013.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S6	Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exposures.
891103_16_ITEM7A_P5_S7	Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of IAC/InterActiveCorp We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of IAC/InterActiveCorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.

891103_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of IAC/InterActiveCorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
891103_16_ITEM8_P1_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), IAC/InterActiveCorp's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

891103_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	Investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial matters of the investee are accounted for using the cost method.

891103_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	The Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_16_ITEM8_P26_S4	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.

891103_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_16_ITEM8_P43_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.

891103_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	These services agreements require that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google.
891103_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Google may generally unilaterally update its own policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	from Google is $1.3 billion , $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion , respectively.

891103_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
891103_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with financial institutions and are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
891103_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves.
891103_16_ITEM8_P49_S1	Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
891103_16_ITEM8_P49_S2	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.

891103_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Company capitalizes certain internal use software costs including external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the software and compensation for personnel directly associated with the development of the software.
891103_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
891103_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	The net book value of capitalized internal use software is $39.6 million and $36.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill In connection with some business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S4	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics such as monthly active users.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S5	The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S6	Determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S7	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S8	The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_16_ITEM8_P52_S9	See Note 7 for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2015, a quantitative assessment of the Match Group, Publishing, Applications, ShoeBuy and P riceRunner reporting units' goodwill was performed.
891103_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	A qualitative assessment of the HomeAdvisor, Connected Ventur es, and DailyBurn reporting units' goodwill was performed.
891103_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	When the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise, the fair value of the reporting unit has to be determined and if the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its reporting units using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach.
891103_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the judgment about the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_16_ITEM8_P56_S2	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed annually based on each reporting unit's current results and forecast, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_16_ITEM8_P56_S3	The discount rates used in the Company's annual goodwill impairment assessment ranged from 12% to 22% in 2015 and 13% to 19% in 2014 .
891103_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer gr oup of companies.
891103_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.
891103_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
891103_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1.
891103_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Company determines the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using avoided royalty DCF analyses.
891103_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in 2015 and 10% to 20% in 2014 , and the royalty rates used ranged from 1% to 9% in both 2015 and 2014 .
891103_16_ITEM8_P61_S3	In connection with the annual assessments in 2015, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges of $88.0 million related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets at the Publishing segment and $14.1 million at the Other segment related to goodwill at ShoeBuy.
891103_16_ITEM8_P61_S4	At October 1, 2015, the date of our most recent annual impairment assessment, the fair value of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20% with the exception of Publishing and ShoeBuy.
891103_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at Publishing related to certain trade names of certain Ask Other direct marketing brands, including Ask.com.
891103_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The impairment charge reflects the impact of recent Google ecosystem changes that have impacted our ability to market, the effect of the reduced revenue share on mobile under the terms of the services agreement with Google, which was entered into on October 26, 2015, and the shift in focus to higher margin businesses in Publishing's Premium Brands.
891103_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	The combined impact of these factors has reduced the forecasted revenue and profits for these brands and the impairment charge reflects the resultant reduction in fair value.
891103_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	The impairment charge is included in "Amortization of intangibles" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_16_ITEM8_P62_S4	The goodwill impairment charge at ShoeBuy was due to increased investment and the seasonal effect of high inventory levels as of October 1, 2015, the date of our most recent annual assessment.
891103_16_ITEM8_P62_S5	The 2014 and 2013 annual assessments identified no material impairments.
891103_16_ITEM8_P62_S6	To illustrate the magnitude of a potential impairment charge relative to future changes in estimated fair value, had the estimated fair value of Publishing and ShoeBuy been hypothetically lower by 10% and 20% as of October 1, 2015, the carrying value of Publishing would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $20 million and $60 million , respectively, and the carrying value of ShoeBuy would have exceeded its fair value by approximately $1 million and $5 million , respectively.
891103_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company's reporting units are consistent with its determination of its operating segments.
891103_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
891103_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	See Note 13 for additional information regarding the Company's method of determining operating and reportable segments.
891103_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Definite Lives Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is computed either on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset will be realized.
891103_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.
891103_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used.
891103_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
891103_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	See Note 7 for a discussion of fair value measurements made using Level 3 inputs.
891103_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity and cost method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.
891103_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.
891103_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Traffic Acquisition Costs Traffic acquisition costs consist of payments made to partners who distribute our Partnerships customized browser-based applications, integrate our paid listings into their websites and fees related to the distribution and facilitation of in-app purchase of product features.
891103_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements.
891103_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	The Company expenses these payments in the period incurred as a component of cost of revenue.
891103_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred (when the advertisement first runs for production costs that are initially capitalized) and represent online marketing, including fees paid to search engines and third parties that distribute our Consumer downloadable applications, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to the Match Group brands.
891103_16_ITEM8_P73_S4	Advertising expense is $1.2 billion , $994.7 million and $850.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
891103_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company capitalizes and amortizes the costs associated with certain distribution arrangements that require it to pay a fee per access point delivered.
891103_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	These access points are generally in the form of downloadable applications associated with our Consumer operations.
891103_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	These fees are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent the Company can reasonably estimate a probable future economic benefit and the period over which such benefit will be realized (generally 18 months).
891103_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred.
891103_16_ITEM8_P74_S4	Legal Costs Legal costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	Income Taxes The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
891103_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

891103_16_ITEM8_P106_S15	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $8.1 million by December 31, 2016, primarily due to expirations of statutes of limitations; $7.7 million of which would reduce the income tax provision for continuing operations.

891103_16_ITEM8_P164_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_16_ITEM8_P164_S2	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.

891103_16_ITEM8_P167_S2	The service requirement provides that these awards vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
891103_16_ITEM8_P167_S3	The grant date fair value of each market-based award is estimated using a lattice model that incorporates a Monte Carlo simulation of IAC's stock price.
891103_16_ITEM8_P167_S4	The inputs used to fair value these awards include a weighted average expected volatility of 27% , risk-free interest rate of 2.3% and a 1.8% dividend yield.
891103_16_ITEM8_P167_S5	The expected term of these awards is derived from the output of the option valuation model.
891103_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	Expense is recognized over the longer of the vesting period of each of the four installments or the expected term.
891103_16_ITEM8_P168_S1	The weighted average expected term of these awards is 4 years .

891103_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	Match Group stock-based awards are issued pursuant to its stock incentive plan.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	IAC has granted stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights, which are denominated in the equity of its subsidiaries, to employees and management of certain subsidiaries.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S1	These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S2	The value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S3	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S4	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S5	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration, at various dates through 2024.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S6	The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term.
891103_16_ITEM8_P174_S7	The aggregate number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at December 31, 2015 is 6.4 million shares, which is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, if the effect is dilutive.

891103_16_ITEM8_P176_S1	The award has a vesting multiple times a year and is fully vested in 2017.
891103_16_ITEM8_P176_S2	At December 31, 2015 , the total fair value of this award, at current estimated fair value including vested and unvested interests, is $19.6 million .
891103_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker views the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_16_ITEM8_P177_S1	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of the Other reportable segment, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate operating segments.
891103_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) The Company's primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_16_ITEM8_P178_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_16_ITEM8_P178_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments.
891103_16_ITEM8_P178_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_16_ITEM8_P179_S1	(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.
891103_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	Revenue by geography is based on where the customer is located.
891103_16_ITEM8_P180_S1	Geographic information about revenue and long-lived assets is presented below:
891103_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following tables reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss) for the Company's reportable segments and to net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders:
891103_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	The following tables reconcile segment assets to total assets:
891103_16_ITEM8_P183_S0	_____________________________________ (c) Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and IAC's headquarters building.
891103_16_ITEM8_P183_S1	(d) Prior to the fourth quarter of 2015, Search Applications was a reportable segment consisting of one operating segment and one reporting unit.
891103_16_ITEM8_P183_S2	In the fourth quarter of 2015, Search Applications was split into three new operating segments and reportable units: Publishing, Applications and PriceRunner (included in the Other segment).
891103_16_ITEM8_P183_S3	The goodwill of Search Applications was allocated to these three reporting units based upon their relative fair values as of October 1, 2015.
891103_16_ITEM8_P183_S4	It is not possible to reflect this allocation on a retrospective basis because of acquisitions and dispositions during the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
891103_16_ITEM8_P183_S5	See Note 1 for additional information on the realignment of IAC's reportable segments and Note 4 for additional information on goodwill.
891103_16_ITEM8_P184_S0	NOTE 14 COMMITMENTS The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with its operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses.
891103_16_ITEM8_P184_S1	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement.
891103_16_ITEM8_P184_S2	These operating expenses are not included in the table below.

891103_16_ITEM8_P186_S1	The Company's most significant operating lease is a seventy-seven year land lease for IAC's headquarters building in New York City and approximates 53% of the future minimum payments due under all operating lease agreements in the table above.
891103_16_ITEM8_P186_S2	The Company also has funding commitments that could potentially require its performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events as follows:
891103_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	The purchase obligations primarily include advertising commitments.
891103_16_ITEM8_P187_S1	The letters of credit support the Company's casualty insurance program.
891103_16_ITEM8_P188_S0	NOTE 15 CONTINGENCIES In the ordinary course of business, the Company is a party to various lawsuits.
891103_16_ITEM8_P188_S1	The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
891103_16_ITEM8_P188_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_16_ITEM8_P188_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_16_ITEM8_P188_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss.
891103_16_ITEM8_P188_S5	It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.
891103_16_ITEM8_P188_S6	See Note 3 for additional information related to income tax contingencies.

891103_16_ITEM8_P194_S2	The Company paid $25 million ( 50% of the total purchase price and refurbish costs) for its interest.

891103_16_ITEM8_P198_S6	The increase in matching contributions in 2015 is due primarily to an increase in participation in the plan due to increased headcount and recent acquisitions.

891103_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
891103_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
891103_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	In making this assessment, our management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in "Internal Control Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.

891103_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
891103_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The Company monitors and evaluates on an ongoing basis its internal control over financial reporting in order to improve its overall effectiveness.
891103_16_ITEM9A_P4_S1	In the course of these evaluations, the Company modifies and refines its internal processes as conditions warrant.
891103_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	As required by Rule 13a-15(d), IAC management, including the Chairman and Senior Executive, the Chief Executive Officer and the Acting Principal Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

891103_16_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

891103_16_ITEM9A_P7_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

891103_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	OVERVIEW Who We Are IAC is a leading media and Internet company comprised of widely known consumer brands, such as HomeAdvisor, Vimeo, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast, Investopedia, and Match Group's online dating portfolio, which includes Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid.
891103_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	For information regarding the results of operations of IAC s segments, as well as their respective contributions to IAC s consolidated results of operations, see Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8-Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
891103_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	All references to IAC, the Company, we, our or us in this report are to IAC/InterActiveCorp.
891103_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our History IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc.
891103_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally, to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company.
891103_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	From 1997 through 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com) and Expedia, as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies.
891103_17_ITEM1_P1_S3	In 2002, the Company contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, a joint venture, and sold its interests in that venture to NBC Universal in 2005.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	In 2003, the Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire).
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. and completed the separation of its travel and travel related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2008, IAC separated into five independent, publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster (now Live Nation, Inc.) and Tree.com, Inc.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	In 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic, a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a 5 million note.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S4	In 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation s equity stake in IAC.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S5	In 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S6	In 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic, ValueClick s owned and operated website businesses, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, and The Princeton Review.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S7	In 2015, we acquired Plentyoffish Media Inc., a leading provider of subscription-based and ad-supported online personals servicing North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, for $575 million in cash, and completed the initial public offering of Match Group, Inc.
891103_17_ITEM1_P2_S8	In 2016, we acquired VHX, a platform for premium over-the-top (OTT) subscription video channels, as well a controlling interest in MyHammer Holding AG, the leading home services marketplace in Germany, and sold PriceRunner, ASKfm and ShoeBuy.
891103_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND VOTE IAC has outstanding shares of common stock, with one vote per share, and shares of Class B common stock, with ten votes per share and which are convertible into common stock on a share for share basis.
891103_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	As of January 27, 2017, Mr. Diller, his spouse, Diane von Furstenberg, and his stepson, Alexander von Furstenberg, collectively beneficially owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock and 136,711 shares of IAC common stock, all of which were held in trusts for the benefit of Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, and 1,711 shares of IAC common stock held by a private foundation.
891103_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	As of that date, the shares of IAC Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family collectively represented 100% of IAC s outstanding Class B common stock and, together with the shares of IAC common stock also beneficially owned by these individuals, represented approximately 44.7% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_17_ITEM1_P3_S3	Mr. Diller also holds 550,000 vested options and 750,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
891103_17_ITEM1_P4_S1	As a result of IAC securities beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Match Group Overview Our Match Group segment includes the dating and non-dating businesses of Match Group, Inc. ( Match Group ), which completed its initial public offering on November 24, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	As of December 31, 2016, IAC s ownership interest and voting interest in Match Group were 82.5% and 97.9%, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Through Match Group, we operate a dating business that consists of a portfolio with over 45 brands, available in 42 languages, and offered in over 190 countries, including the following key brands: Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish, Meetic, OkCupid, Pairs, Twoo, OurTime, BlackPeopleMeet and LoveScout24.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	We operate a North America dating business, which includes Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish, OkCupid, our various affinity brands and other dating businesses operating within the United States and Canada, and an International dating business, which includes Meetic, Pairs, Twoo, the international operations of Tinder and PlentyOfFish and all other dating businesses operating outside of the United States and Canada.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	Through the brands within our dating business, we are a leading provider of membership-based and ad-supported dating products servicing North America, Western Europe and many other regions around the world.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	We provide these services through websites and applications that we own and operate.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S4	All of our dating products enable users to establish a profile and review other people s profiles without charge.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S5	Each product also offers additional features, some of which are free, and some of which require payment depending on the particular product.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S6	In general, access to premium features requires a paid membership, which is typically offered in packages (primarily ranging from one month to six months), depending on the product and circumstance.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S7	Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of membership purchased, by the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access, and by whether or not a customer is taking advantage of any special offers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S8	In addition to paid memberships, many of our dating products offer users the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time, or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other members, and these features are offered on a pay per use basis.
891103_17_ITEM1_P6_S9	The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand by brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
891103_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	In addition to our dating business, we also operate a non dating business through Match Group s ownership of The Princeton Review, which provides a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Princeton Review includes Tutor.com (acquired in 2012) and The Princeton Review (acquired in 2014).
891103_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	In January 2017, Match Group entered into a definitive agreement to sell The Princeton Review to ST Unitas, a global education technology company.
891103_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2017.
891103_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	The substantial majority of the Match Group segment s revenue is attributable to the dating business.
891103_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	Dating business revenue is substantially derived directly from users in the form of recurring membership fees for subscription-based online personals and related services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	Revenue is also earned from online advertising, the purchase of la carte features and offline events.
891103_17_ITEM1_P8_S3	Non-dating revenue consists primarily of fees received directly from students for in-person and online test preparation classes, access to online test preparation materials and individual tutoring services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Marketing We attract the majority of users of our dating products through word of mouth and other free channels.
891103_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	In addition, many of our brands rely on paid customer acquisition for a significant percentage of their users.
891103_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns and business development or partnership deals.
891103_17_ITEM1_P9_S3	Our offline marketing activities generally consist of television advertising and related public relations efforts, as well as events.
891103_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Competition The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand globally.
891103_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	We compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products.
891103_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	In addition to other online dating brands, we compete indirectly with offline dating services, such as in person matchmakers, and social media platforms.
891103_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	Arguably, our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other, and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	the design and functionality of our dating products.
891103_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	HomeAdvisor Overview HomeAdvisor is a leading global home services digital marketplace that helps connect consumers with home professionals in North America, as well as in France, the Netherlands and Italy under various brands.
891103_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	In November 2016, HomeAdvisor acquired a controlling interest in MyHammer Holding AG, the leading home services marketplace in Germany.
891103_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2016, HomeAdvisor s domestic network of home services professionals consisted of approximately 143,000 paying professionals in the United States providing services in more than 500 categories ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling projects.
891103_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	HomeAdvisor generated approximately 13.2 million domestic service requests from homeowners during the year ended December 31, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	HomeAdvisor also operates Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service, CraftJack, a lead generation service, and mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud based field service software for small to mid-size businesses.
891103_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	When a consumer submits a request through the HomeAdvisor marketplace, we generally match that consumer with up to four home services professionals from our network based on the type of services desired and the consumer s location.
891103_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Consumers can then review profiles of home services professionals with whom they have been matched and select the professional whom they believe best meets their specific needs.
891103_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	In addition to (or in lieu of) submitting a request through our marketplace, consumers can also search, select and contact home service professionals directly through our online directory.
891103_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	In all cases, the consumer is under no obligation to work with home service professionals referred by or found through HomeAdvisor.
891103_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	HomeAdvisor also provides two on-demand services that complement its matching services: Instant Booking and Instant Connect (patent-pending).
891103_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Through Instant Booking, consumers can schedule appointments for select home tasks on-demand with a pre-screened home services professional instantly across our platforms (website or mobile application), and through Instant Connect, consumers can connect with a home services professional instantly via phone.
891103_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access our free, online True Cost Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types on a local basis, as well as an online library of home services related resources, which primarily includes articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with home services professionals.
891103_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	Consumers can also access HomeAdvisor services and tools on iOS and Android devices (including the Apple Watch ) and through HomeAdvisor's mobile application, as well as access its Instant Connect service through Amazon's Echo product.
891103_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Subscription Services for Home Services Professionals Home services professionals who are new to HomeAdvisor must sign up for an annual membership package.
891103_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our basic annual membership package includes membership in our network of home services professionals, as well as a listing in our online directory and matches through the marketplace.
891103_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2016, approximately 93% of the approximately 143,000 domestic paying home services professionals within our network had purchased a membership package.
891103_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	We also offer subscription products that include custom website and mobile development and hosting services, as well as integration with mHelpDesk.
891103_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	The HomeAdvisor segment s revenue is primarily derived from fees paid by home services professionals for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service), subscription fees and fees for website hosting services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	Fees for matches vary based upon the service requested, type of match and where the service is provided.
891103_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Marketing We market our services to consumers primarily through television advertising, as well as through search engine marketing and affiliate agreements with third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	Pursuant to these agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote our services and those of our home services professionals on their websites and we agree to pay them a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through our website (on a cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to our website (on a cost-per-click basis).
891103_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also market our services to consumers through e-mails, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser extent, through direct mail and radio advertising.
891103_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	We market our subscription packages to home services professionals primarily through our sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade associations.
891103_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	Competition We compete with home services-related lead generation services, as well as Internet search engines and directories and with other forms of local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline directories.
891103_17_ITEM1_P19_S5	We also compete with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P19_S6	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	our ability to build and maintain awareness of (and loyalty to) the HomeAdvisor brand.
891103_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Video Overview Our Video segment consists primarily of Vimeo, Electus, CollegeHumor, Notional, IAC Films and Daily Burn.
891103_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Vimeo operates a global video sharing platform for creators and their audiences.
891103_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Through Vimeo, we offer video creators simple, professional grade tools to share, manage, distribute and monetize content online, and provide viewers with a clutter-free environment to watch content across a variety of Internet-enabled devices, including mobile devices and connected television platforms.
891103_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	We offer these basic services free of charge.
891103_17_ITEM1_P22_S3	We also offer premium services through subscription products, which provide paying subscribers with various levels of premium features, including: additional video storage space, advanced video privacy controls, extensive video player customization options, team collaboration, review and workflow tools, e-mail lead generation, premium support and the ability to sell videos and OTT video channels (through VHX, a platform for premium OTT subscription video channels that we acquired in 2016), directly to consumers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	As of December 31, 2016, Vimeo had approximately 768,000 paid subscribers and reached over 240 million unique users worldwide.
891103_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	We also provide on-demand services through which video creators can sell videos they create to consumers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	As of December 31, 2016, our on-demand services featured over 60,000 titles in a variety of genres from more than 15,000 creators and sold titles to more than 2.8 million consumers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	Titles are added to our Video On Demand marketplace by video creators through direct uploads to www.vimeo.com and through negotiated agreements with content owners, producers and distributors to acquire titles.
891103_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We also provide tools through which video owners and distributors can offer branded, over-the-top (OTT) video channels directly to consumers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Video owners and distributors can offer their content on a subscription or la carte basis through applications for all major mobile and set top box platforms.
891103_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We market Vimeo s services primarily through online marketing efforts, including search engine marketing, social media, e-mail campaigns, display advertising and affiliate marketing, as well as through offline advertising and upgrade channels on the Vimeo platform (website and mobile application).
891103_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	Vimeo revenue is derived primarily from subscription fees and, to a lesser extent, from video sales and OTT service fees.
891103_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Vimeo competes with a variety of online video providers, including those that serve video creators and consumers through advertising-supported, subscription or transactional fee models.
891103_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe that Vimeo differentiates itself from its competitors by offering a customizable, high definition video player, proprietary uploading and encoding infrastructure and a clutter-free viewing experience (advertisements are not placed in video streams on www.vimeo.com ).
891103_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily on:
891103_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	our ability to drive new subscribers and viewers to our platform through various forms of direct advertising.
891103_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Through Electus, we provide production and producer services for both unscripted and scripted television, feature film and digital content, primarily for initial sale and distribution in the United States.

891103_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Electus revenue is derived primarily from media production and distribution and display advertising.
891103_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	We do not engage in any formal marketing efforts in the case of our production and executive producer services, instead relying on referrals and the quality of our services and projects.
891103_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	For content distribution, we rely on our sales force, referrals and the quality of our services and projects, and for international distribution only, attendance at industry trade shows.
891103_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	In addition, the platforms to which we license our content for distribution market our content through their own independent marketing efforts.
891103_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	Electus Digital attracts users and audience primarily through social media, search engine marketing and affiliate agreements.
891103_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	We compete with entertainment studios, production companies, distribution companies, creative agencies and content websites.
891103_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	We believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	our ability to sell integration and sponsorship opportunities for our content.
891103_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Daily Burn is a health and fitness property that provides streaming fitness and workout videos across a variety of platforms, including iOS, Android, Roku and other Internet-enabled television platforms.

891103_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	We market our streaming fitness and workout videos primarily through television advertising, advertising on ad-supported video-on-demand services and content platforms and search engine marketing.
891103_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The fitness and workout market is highly competitive and barriers to entry, particularly in the case of online platforms, are minimal.
891103_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	We compete primarily with other streaming fitness and workout platforms and, to a lesser extent, fitness and workout DVDs.
891103_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Applications Overview Our Applications segment consists of:
891103_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Partnerships, which includes our business-to-business partnership operations.
891103_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Consumer Through our Consumer business, we develop, market and distribute a variety of applications, including desktop applications that are tailored to a number of specific online uses and through which users can access search services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	The majority of our applications are browser extensions, which consist of a browser tab page and related technology that together enable users to run search queries directly from their web browsers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	Many of our browser extensions are coupled with other applications that we have developed that provide users with access to various forms of content and software capabilities.
891103_17_ITEM1_P37_S3	These applications include: FromDoctoPDF , through which users can convert documents from one format into various others and share them across multiple platforms; MapsGalaxy , through which users can access accurate street maps, local traffic conditions and aerial and satellite street views; and WeatherBlink , through which users can access local weather conditions and satellite radar maps directly from their web browsers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P37_S4	Other applications target users with a special or passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as recipes, entertainment and religion, among others) or provide users with particular reference information or access to specific capabilities (such as internet speed and package tracking, among others).
891103_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	We distribute our utility applications directly to consumers free of charge.
891103_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Apalon is an award-winning mobile development company with one of the largest and most popular portfolios of mobile applications worldwide.
891103_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	SlimWare is a provider of community-powered software and services that clean, repair, update and optimize personal computers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	Partnerships Through our Partnerships business, we work closely with partners in the software, media and other industries to design and develop customized browser based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners products and services.
891103_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Substantially all of the Applications segment's revenue consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries.
891103_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites.
891103_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by advertisers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	The substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our Applications businesses are supplied to us by Google Inc. ("Google") in the manner provided by and pursuant to a services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2020.
891103_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
891103_17_ITEM1_P42_S4	Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Applications businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results.
891103_17_ITEM1_P42_S5	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages.
891103_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Applications businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us.
891103_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	We recognize paid listing revenue from Google when it delivers the user's click.
891103_17_ITEM1_P43_S3	In cases where the user s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs.
891103_17_ITEM1_P43_S4	See Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	To a significantly lesser extent, the Applications segment's revenue also consists of fees related to subscription downloadable applications, fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications and display advertisements.
891103_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Competition We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to develop, market and distribute applications and related technology directly and through third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Bing and other third party browser extension, convenience search and applications providers and other search technology and convenience service providers.
891103_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Applications businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	We believe that the ability of our Applications businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to:
891103_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	market and distribute our browser extensions and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner.
891103_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	our Ask Other business, which primarily includes Ask.com and CityGrid.
891103_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	Our Publishing businesses publish digital content and/or provide search services to users.
891103_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	Those of our Publishing businesses that publish digital content (our Premium Brands) generate such content through various sources, including, for example, through a network of experts in the case of About.com and internal editorial staff in the case of The Daily Beast, and/or acquire such content (or the rights to publish such content) from third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services generally generate and display of a set of algorithmic search results, or hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users.
891103_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries.
891103_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	The paid listings displayed by our Publishing businesses are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above.
891103_17_ITEM1_P49_S5	Our Premium Brands business primarily consists of the following destination websites:
891103_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Daily Beast, a website dedicated to news, commentary, culture and entertainment that curates and publishes existing and original online content from its own roster of contributors in the United States.
891103_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	During 2016, About.com evolved from a general content website to a collection of vertical brands by transitioning content from the various network channels on its general content website to stand-alone vertical domains, each with its own unique branding and user experience.
891103_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	To date, content from four network channels (specifically, Health, Money, Tech, and Home) has been transitioned to four verticals (Verywell.com, TheBalance.com, Lifewire.com and TheSpruce.com, respectively ).
891103_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	We currently intend to launch additional verticals in 2017.
891103_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	Ask Other Our Ask Other business consists primarily of:
891103_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	CityGrid, an advertising network that integrates local content and advertising for distribution to affiliated and third party publishers across web and mobile platforms.
891103_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Publishing segment's revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, display advertisements (sold directly and through programmatic ad sales) and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications.
891103_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	The substantial majority of the paid listings that our Publishing businesses display are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above.
891103_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Competition We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers to our Publishing businesses.
891103_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	In terms of publishing digital content, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results in relevant vertical categories and social channels.
891103_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	In terms of providing search services, generally our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications).
891103_17_ITEM1_P54_S3	Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Publishing businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_17_ITEM1_P54_S4	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_17_ITEM1_P54_S5	We believe that the ability of our Publishing businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon:
891103_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	our ability to successfully market the content and search services offered by our Publishing businesses in a cost-effective manner.
891103_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Other Our Other segment consisted of ShoeBuy, an Internet retailer of footwear and related apparel and accessories, and PriceRunner, a shopping comparison website.
891103_17_ITEM1_P56_S1	PriceRunner was sold in March 2016 and ShoeBuy was sold in December 2016.
891103_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2016, IAC and its subsidiaries employed approximately 5,800 full-time employees and approximately 3,300 part-time employees.

891103_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The use of words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, plans and believes, among others, generally identify forward looking statements.

891103_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These forward looking statements are based on IAC management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.

891103_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC s business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	IAC does not undertake to update these forward looking statements.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risk Factors Mr. Diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting and/or investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	As a result, Mr. Diller and these family members are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	As of January 27, 2017, Mr. Diller, his spouse, Diane von Furstenberg, and his stepson, Alexander von Furstenberg, collectively beneficially owned 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock and 136,711 shares of IAC common stock, all of which were held in trusts for the benefit of Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, and 1,711 shares of IAC common stock held by a private foundation.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	As of that date, the shares of IAC Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family collectively represented 100% of IAC s outstanding Class B common stock and, together with the shares of IAC common stock also beneficially owned by these individuals, represented approximately 44.7% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Mr. Diller also holds 550,000 vested options and 750,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	As a result of IAC securities beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Effective succession planning is also important to our future success.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S5	If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S6	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S7	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Publishing and Applications properties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S9	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search related services.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S10	Our current agreement with Google expires on March 31, 2020.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P4_S11	The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to advertisers) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Publishing and Applications properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to users) of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Changes to the amount Google charges to advertisers, Google s paid listings network efficiency, its judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our Publishing and Applications properties or the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our services agreement with Google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google for the use of its brands and services, including with respect to which products and applications may access Google's services, and the manner in which Google s paid listings are displayed within search results across various platforms and products.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Google may generally unilaterally update its own policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Noncompliance with Google s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for our applications could, if not cured, result in Google s suspension of some or all of its services to our websites or the websites of our third party partners or the termination of the services agreement by Google.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S9	The termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of IAC s rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P5_S10	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	General economic events or trends, particularly those that reduce advertising spending and/or adversely impact consumer confidence, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue (primarily revenue from our Applications and Publishing segments) is attributable to online advertising.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Similarly, some of our businesses (primarily HomeAdvisor) are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	For example, in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions, consumer confidence, spending levels and credit availability could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects, which could result in a decrease in fees paid by home service professionals for consumer matches, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	We could also experience turnover in our network of home services professionals given that a significant number of our home services professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, and as such, are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	While these home services professionals are required to agree that they will operate in accordance with our terms and conditions, we do not enter into long term agreements with them.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Any turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could result in a decrease in traffic to our properties and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S7	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Our success depends, in part, upon the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising, particularly paid listings, as an effective alternative to traditional, offline advertising and the continued commercial use of the Internet.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S9	We continue to compete with traditional advertising media, including television, radio and print, in addition to a multitude of websites with high levels of traffic and online advertising networks, for a share of available advertising expenditures and expect to face continued competition as more emerging media and traditional offline media companies continue to enter the online advertising market.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S10	We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, to a large extent, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of mobile advertising), the continued growth in commercial use of the Internet (particularly abroad), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage click fraud.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising, particularly for paid listings, or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to changes in laws, changes in industry practices, the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments) would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The distribution and use of our products and services depends, in part, on third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	For example, as our users and customers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications, we (primarily in the case of Match Group s dating business and Apalon, one of the businesses within our Applications segment) increasingly depend upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Both Apple and Google have broad discretion to change their respective terms and conditions applicable to the distribution of our mobile applications, and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute our mobile applications through their stores.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	We cannot assure you that Apple or Google will not limit or eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If either or both of them did so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	The use of certain of our products and services also depends, in part, on third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	For example, users of Match Group's Tinder dating product currently register for (and log in to) Tinder exclusively through their Facebook profiles.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P9_S8	While Match Group is currently in the process of developing an alternate authentication method that would allow users to register for (and log into) Tinder using their mobile phone number, no assurances can be provided that users will use this method versus registering for (and logging into) Tinder through their Facebook profiles.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	otherwise interfere with our ability to use Facebook as an authentication method and if Facebook did so and no alternate authentication method is available (or the alternate method Match Group ultimately develops is not adopted by users), Match Group s (and in turn, our) business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Lastly, certain of the businesses within our Applications and Publishing segments have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Most of these agreements are either non exclusive and short term in nature or, in the case of long term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, a few of these agreements collectively represent a significant percentage of the revenue generated by our Partnerships business.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	The inability of these businesses to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various properties, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Our success depends, in part, on our continued ability to introduce new and enhanced content, products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and that otherwise resonate with our users and customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	We may not be able to convert traffic into repeat users and customers unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced content, products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies and provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with our users and customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The development of new content, products and services, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in this dynamic environment, require significant time and resources.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to these changes, appropriately time the introduction of new content, products and services or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Also, these changes could require us to modify related infrastructures and our failure to do so could render our existing websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our failure to respond to any of these changes appropriately and efficiently could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, third parties could continue to develop technologies and policies that may interfere with the ability of users to access or utilize our products and services generally, otherwise make users less likely to use our products and services or interfere with the advertising efforts of our various businesses.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	For example, third parties have developed technologies that can block the display of online advertisements across platforms (particularly and increasingly in the case with mobile platforms) and that provide users with the ability to opt out of advertising products.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	In addition, third parties continue to introduce technologies (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent certain types of applications from being installed and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that users will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our failure to successfully modify our websites and products in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of new technologies, or our failure to find alternative sources of revenue to support websites and products that currently generate revenue through advertising, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Lastly, while the continued introduction of new content, products and services is critical to our success, by definition, new content, products and services have limited operating histories, which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our current business and future prospects.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P11_S9	For example, through Match Group, we seek to tailor each of our dating products to meet the preferences of specific communities of users.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Building a given dating product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Although certain of our newer dating products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time, the historical growth rates of these dating products are not necessarily an indicator of future growth rates for our newer dating products generally.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We have encountered, and may continue to encounter, risks and difficulties as we build new content, brands and products.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The failure to successfully address these risks and difficulties could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various websites may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have made, and expect to continue to make, significant expenditures for search engine marketing (primarily in the form of the purchase of keywords, which we purchase primarily through Google and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft and Yahoo!), online display advertising and traditional offline advertising (including television) in connection with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Historically, we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and retain users and customers and sustain our growth.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the case of paid advertising generally, our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller, publisher of advertising (including through search engines and social networks and platforms) or marketing affiliate.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	As a result, any such third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising or advertise some of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We cannot assure you that we will not be limited or prohibited from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the case of any of our businesses in the future.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	If this were to happen in the case of a significant marketing channel and/or for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers, publishers of advertising or marketing affiliates, our advertisements could be removed without notice and/or our accounts could be suspended or terminated, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	without advance notice), could adversely affect both the placement of paid listings that appear in response to keywords we purchase, the pricing of online advertising we purchase generally and how our websites rank within search results, any or all of which would increase our costs and adversely impact the effectiveness of our advertising efforts overall.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Certain of our businesses engage in efforts similar to search engine optimization involving Facebook and other social media platforms (for example, developing content designed to appear higher in a given Facebook News Feed and generate "likes") that involve challenges and risks similar to those faced in connection with our broader search engine marketing and optimization efforts.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Also, search engines continue to expand their offerings into other, non-search related categories, and in certain instances display their own integrated or related product and service offerings in a more prominent manner than those of third parties within their search results.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Continued expansion and competition from search engines could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our various properties, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Separately, evolving consumer behavior can affect the availability of cost-effective marketing opportunities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	For example, as traditional television viewership declines and consumers spend more time on mobile devices rather than desktop computers, the reach of many of traditional online and offline advertising channels is contracting.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	To continue to reach potential users and customers, we must continue to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer advertising channels, such as mobile and online video platforms, as well as targeted campaigns in which we communicate directly with potential, former and current users via new virtual means.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Generally, the opportunities in (and sophistication of) newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to opportunities in traditional online and offline channels and if we are unable to continue to appropriately manage and fine tune our marketing efforts in response to these and other trends in the advertising industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Lastly, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various websites and mobile applications, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Any failure to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) traffic, users and customers in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Communicating with our users via e-mail is critical to our success, and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations .
891103_17_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Primarily in the case of Match Group s dating business, one of our primary means of communicating with users and customers and keeping them engaged with our products and services is via e-mail.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	As consumer habits evolve in the era of smart phones and messaging/social networking apps, usage of e-mail, particularly among younger users and customers, has declined.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, deliverability and other restrictions imposed by third party e-mail providers and/or applicable law could limit or prevent our ability to send e-mails to our users and customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	A continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with our users and customers via e-mail could have an adverse impact on user and customer experience, levels of user engagement and, in the case of Match Group s dating businesses, the rate at which non paying users become paid members.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	be as effective as e-mail has been historically.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to build, maintain and/or enhance our various brands.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal within their respective industries, as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We believe that our success depends, in part, upon our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) our emerging brands.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Our brands and brand-building efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, governmental or regulatory authorities and related media coverage and data protection and security breaches.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Moreover, the failure to market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or the inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the Internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact our various brands and brand-building efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S8	We operate in various international markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union, and as result are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the Euro and British Pound ("GBP").
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S9	During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 26% of our total revenues were international revenues.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S10	We translate international revenues into U.S. dollar-denominated operating results and during periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our international revenues will be reduced when translated into U.S. dollars.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P18_S11	In addition, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of our international revenues into U.S. dollar-denominated operating results affects the period-over-period comparability of such results.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Since the average Euro versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2016 was essentially flat compared to 2015, the translation of our international results into U.S. dollars did not significantly reduce our revenue nor did it have a significant effect on the period-over-period comparability of our U.S dollar-denominated operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 versus December 31, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	To the extent that the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen relative to the Euro, the translation of our international revenues into U.S. dollars will reduce our U.S. dollar-denominated operating results and will affect their period-over-period comparability.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Fluctuating foreign exchange rates can also result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	While foreign currency exchange gains and losses historically have not been material to the Company, the significant decline in the GBP due to the Brexit vote on June 23, 2016 generated significant foreign currency exchange gains during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Historically, we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies, could adversely affect our future results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As the distribution of our dating products through app stores increases, in order to maintain our profit margins, we may need to offset increasing app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures, increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected .
891103_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	As users of our dating products continue to shift to mobile solutions, we increasingly rely upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	For example, while our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores, we offer our users the opportunity to purchase paid memberships and certain la carte features through these applications.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We determine the prices at which these memberships and features are sold and, in exchange for facilitating the purchase of these memberships and features through these applications to users who download our applications from these stores, we pay Apple and Google, as applicable, a share (generally 30%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	As the distribution of our dating products through app stores increases, we may need to offset these increased app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue, increasing user volume or monetization per user, or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize mobile versions of our products and services.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	While many of our users continue to access our products and services through personal computers, users of (and usage volumes on) mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, continue to increase relative to those of personal computers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	While we have developed mobile versions of certain of our products and services (and have developed certain products and services exclusively for mobile devices) and intend to continue to do so in the future, we may not be able to monetize these applications as effectively as we monetize our non-mobile products and services.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, the success of our mobile applications is dependent on their interoperability with various mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards that we do not control and any changes in any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our products and services could adversely impact usage of our products and services on mobile devices and, in turn, our ability to attract advertisers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of users and customers to mobile devices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P23_S7	If a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Through Match Group, we own, operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for, and revenue generation from, that product s community of users.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In general, the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity and quality of our systems and infrastructures and those of third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may affect our business.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P24_S6	To succeed, our systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	From time to time, we may experience occasional system interruptions that make some or all of our systems or data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services; any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, broadband or other communications systems at any time.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services to users and customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Any such interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services, tarnish our brands reputation and decrease demand for our products and services, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S6	We also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our technology and network systems to improve the experiences of our users and customers, accommodate substantial increases in the volume of traffic to our properties, ensure acceptable page load times and keep up with changes in technology and user and customer preferences.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect the experiences of our users and customers with our products and services and thereby negatively impact demand for our products and services, and could increase our costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S8	We also rely on third party computer systems, data center service providers, cloud-based web hosting services, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with our users and customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S9	We have no control over any of these third parties or their operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or those of our third party providers, changes in service levels provided by these systems or deterioration in the performance of these systems, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions with users and customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	our reputation and result in the loss of current and potential users and customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may not be able to protect our systems, infrastructures and technologies from cyberattacks.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyberattacks experienced by third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Any disruption of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, or compromise of our user data or other information, due to cyberattacks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks, attempts to misappropriate customer information (including credit card information) or other malicious activities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Events of this nature could compromise the integrity of our systems, infrastructures and technologies, as well as the products and services offered by our various businesses, which could in turn adversely affect our users and customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	The incidence of events of this nature (or any combination thereof) is on the rise worldwide.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S7	While we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses (and their respective systems, infrastructures, technologies, products, services, users and customers), and have invested (and continue to invest) heavily in these efforts and related training, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur, that it will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Any cyberattack or security breach we experience could damage our systems, infrastructures and technologies and/or those of our users and customers, prevent us from providing our products and services, compromise the integrity of our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities and/or litigation that could result in liability to third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our day to day operations) could have a similar effect.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S11	Moreover, even cyberattacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in a loss of consumer confidence generally, which could make consumers and users less likely to use our products and services.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S12	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P26_S13	If the security of personal and confidential user information, including credit card information, that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event, our reputation could be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We receive, process, store and transmit a significant amount of personal user and other confidential information, including credit card information, and enable our users to share their personal information with each other.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In some cases, we retain third party vendors to store this information.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	We continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of this information, but cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If any such event were to occur, we may not be able to remedy the event, and we may have to expend significant capital and resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If a breach of our security (or the security of our vendors and partners) occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the recognition of our various brands and their competitive positions could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	We are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Our various businesses accept payment from our users and customers primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P27_S7	The ability of these businesses to access credit card information on a real time basis without having to proactively reach out to the consumer each time they process a payment for products and services (including auto renewal payments or payments for the purchase of a premium feature on or with any of our products or services) is critical to our success.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	When we experience (or a third party experiences) a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their credit cards.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party s customer base and the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that our users and customers would be impacted by such a breach.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	To the extent our users and customers are ever affected by such a breach experienced by us or a third party, affected individuals would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending transactions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	It is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected individuals, and even if we could, new credit card information for some individuals may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Even if our users and customers are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant user and customer effort.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Additionally, if we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions, we may face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card related costs and substantial remediation costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Finally, the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge users and customers for recurring membership payments may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P28_S7	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, transactions with users and customers and advertising on our websites.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of this information are determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the sharing, storage, use disclosure and protection of personal information and user data.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	These laws, regulations, standards and practices are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations, and new laws, regulations, standards and practices of this nature are adopted from time to time.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	For example, in 2016, the European Commission: (i) and the United States reached an agreement on a new framework for transfers of personal data, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which provides a safe harbor for U.S. companies that transfer data from the EU to the U.S. and (ii) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform that will become effective in May 2018 and will supersede the European Union Data Protection Directive (the "EU Directive") currently in place.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	The GDPR imposes stricter standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and increased penalties for non-compliance relative to the EU Directive.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S6	In addition, the potential exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the application of new and conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and our handling our personal data of users located in the United Kingdom.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S7	In addition, there are a number of draft privacy laws and regulations under consideration in the U.S. (including in various states) and in various foreign jurisdictions in which we do business.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S8	While we believe that we comply with applicable privacy policies, laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security in all material respects, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations, standard and practices, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S9	Moreover, any failure or perceived failure by us (or the third parties with whom we have contracted to handle such information) to comply with applicable privacy laws, privacy policies or privacy related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to personal information could result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P29_S10	In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Lastly, compliance with the numerous privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which our businesses operate (particularly the GDPR) could be costly, particularly as these laws become more comprehensive in scope, more commonplace and continue to evolve.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If these costs are significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $1.6 billion, including $1.2 billion of total debt outstanding at Match Group.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S5	As of this date, we had borrowing availability of $300 million, and Match Group had borrowing availability of $500 million, under our respective revolving credit facilities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Neither Match Group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of IAC or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Similarly, neither IAC nor any of its subsidiaries (other than Match Group and its subsidiaries) guarantee any indebtedness of Match Group or are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Our indebtedness and Match Group's indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:
891103_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	limiting our respective abilities to react to changing market conditions in the various industries in which we do business.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In addition to our respective debt service obligations, our and Match Group s operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our ability or the ability of Match Group to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses, depends on our respective financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing our and Match Group s indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Although the terms of agreements governing our and Match Group s indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries current debt levels, the risks described above could increase.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Also, in the event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds thresholds specified in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock would be limited and the agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness contain similar restrictions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our current and planned indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our ability and the ability of Match Group to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	our future ability and the future ability of Match Group to borrow under our respective revolving credit agreements, the availability of which will depend on, among other things, compliance with the covenants in the then existing agreements governing such indebtedness.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There can be no assurance that we or Match Group will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we or Match Group will be able to draw under our respective revolving credit agreements or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	See also "-We may not freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries" below.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S8	In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, and/or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S9	We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S10	The agreements governing our and Match Group s indebtedness may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S11	Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S12	We may not freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S13	The Company's potential sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, availability under IAC's revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales, including marketable securities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P34_S14	The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or may become subject.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or the making of distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including IAC.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In addition, because Match Group is a separate and distinct legal entity with public shareholders, it has no obligation to provide us with funds for payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	You may experience dilution with respect to your investment in IAC, and IAC may experience dilution with respect to its investment in Match Group, as a result of the settlement of equity awards.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our dilutive securities consist of vested and unvested options to purchase shares of our common stock, restricted stock unit awards and vested and unvested stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries, including Tinder and other Match Group subsidiaries ( Subsidiary Awards ).
891103_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	These dilutive securities are reflected in our share calculations underlying our dilutive earnings per share calculation contained in our financial statements for fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Intra-quarter movements in our stock price, as well as variances between the estimated fair value of our subsidiaries used to calculate such fully-diluted share calculations (which estimated fair value may change from time-to-time and quarter-to-quarter) and the fair value determined in connection with the liquidity events related to Subsidiary Awards, could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in these calculations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The issuance of shares of IAC common stock in settlement of Subsidiary Awards could dilute your ownership interest in IAC.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Subsidiary Awards related to Match Group subsidiaries may be settled in shares of IAC common stock or Match Group common stock, at our option.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In the event we elect to settle these Match Group Subsidiary Awards in shares of Match Group common stock (rather than in shares of IAC common stock), our ownership stake in Match Group would be diluted.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	This dilution could impact our ability, among other things, to maintain Match Group as part of our consolidated tax group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to effect a tax-free distribution of our Match Group stake to our stockholders or to maintain control of Match Group.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	As we generally have the right to maintain our level of ownership in Match Group to the extent Match Group issues additional shares of its capital stock in the future pursuant to an investor rights agreement, we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In addition to the dilution resulting from the issuance of shares of IAC common stock (or Match Group common stock) in settlement of Subsidiary Equity Awards, the holders of the Subsidiary Equity Awards may choose to sell the shares of IAC common stock (or Match Group common stock) they receive in settlement of their Subsidiary Awards into the open market immediately.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If sales are significant and concentrated, they could have a temporary impact on the trading value of our stock (or on Match Group common stock).
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Match Group currently has $350 million of indebtedness outstanding under its term loan.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Borrowings under the term loan are, and any borrowings under Match Group's revolving credit facility will be, at variable rates of interest.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Match Group's term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	As of December 31, 2016, the rate in effect was 4.20%.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S6	If LIBOR were to increase by 100 basis points, then the annual interest and expense payments on the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2016 on the term loan would have increased by $3.5 million.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P41_S7	If LIBOR were to decrease by 100 basis points, then the effective interest rate would decrease by 20 basis points to the LIBOR floor of 0.75% and the annual interest expense and payments in the current year would decrease by $0.7 million.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P42_S3	As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P42_S4	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	successfully manage acquisition related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions may not be realized and future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Also, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S4	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the Internet (particularly via mobile devices) must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P44_S7	These additional risks include, among others:
891103_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	trade sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Laws that do reference the Internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P46_S5	In addition, evolving Internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P46_S6	For example, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it will continue to monitor the use of online "native" advertising (a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that some may view as similar to traditional editorial content) to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive to consumers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our customers.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P47_S3	While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Moreover, laws that regulate the practices of third parties may also adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	through their networks the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by content, website, platform or application.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Open Internet Order's rules could be vacated by the courts in connection with a legal challenge to the FCC's authority to adopt the order, repealed by the FCC or overruled by the U.S. Congress.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If this were to occur, broadband Internet access providers could discriminate against Internet traffic of our businesses in favor of others or charge our businesses to provide their services to users and consumers via their networks, which could increase our costs and would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2038.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S6	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S9	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S10	No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S11	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S12	Despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P49_S13	The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our estimated income taxes could be materially different from income taxes that we ultimately pay.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous jurisdictions abroad.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Significant judgment and estimation is required in determining our provision for income taxes and related matters.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinations are uncertain or otherwise subject to interpretation.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Our determination of our income tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities and we are currently subject to audits in a number of jurisdictions.
891103_17_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Although we believe our income tax estimates and related determinations are reasonable and appropriate, relevant taxing authorities may disagree.

891103_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	Among other remedies, the lawsuit sought to enjoin the filing of the New Certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State, as well as unspecified money damages.

891103_17_ITEM3_P10_S1	On August 17, 2016, the Court issued an order approving the parties proposed schedule.
891103_17_ITEM3_P10_S2	On September 9, 2016, in accordance with the schedule, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint.
891103_17_ITEM3_P10_S3	The new pleading focuses solely on allegedly misleading statements or omissions concerning the Match Group s Non-dating business.

891103_17_ITEM7_P23_S3	The services agreement expires on March 31, 2020; however, the Company may choose to terminate the agreement effective March 31, 2019.

891103_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice; which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

891103_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	In 2016, the Company's revenue decreased 3% and operating income declined $212.2 million to a loss of $32.6 million ; however, the Company delivered 3% Adjusted EBITDA growth.
891103_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Revenue declined due primarily to significant decreases from Publishing and Applications, partially offset by strong growth at Match Group and HomeAdvisor.
891103_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	The operating income decline, despite higher Adjusted EBITDA, was due primarily to increases of $261.3 million in goodwill impairment charges, $9.5 million in depreciation and a change of $18.0 million in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by a decrease of $60.5 million in amortization of intangibles.
891103_17_ITEM7_P30_S5	The increase in goodwill impairment charges is due to the write-off of goodwill of $275.4 million at Publishing in the current year period compared to the write-off of goodwill of $14.1 million at ShoeBuy in the prior year period.
891103_17_ITEM7_P30_S6	The change in acquisition-related contingent consideration fair value adjustments reflects expense in the current year period of $2.6 million versus income of $15.5 million in the prior year period.

891103_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Interest expense in 2016 increased from 2015 due to the $800 million of borrowings under the Match Group Term Loan in November 2015, of which $400 million was refinanced on June 1, 2016 with the 2016 Match Group Senior Notes, and the 2% higher interest rate associated with the 2015 Match Group Senior Notes which were issued in exchange for a substantially like amount of 2012 Senior Notes, partially offset by the repurchases and redemptions of the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes during the year.
891103_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Interest expense in 2015 increased from 2014 due primarily to both the costs and the higher interest rate associated with the exchange of $445 million of Match Group Senior Notes for a substantially like amount of 2012 Senior Notes, as well as the $800 million Match Group Term Loan.
891103_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	In connection with the note exchange, $7.3 million in costs were expensed during 2015.
891103_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	The note exchange and term loan borrowings closed on November 16, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	Interest expense in 2015 was also impacted by the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the redemption of the Liberty Bonds on September 1, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Other income, net in 2016 includes gains of $37.5 million and $12.0 million related to the sale of ShoeBuy and PriceRunner, respectively, $34.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gains due to strengthening of the dollar relative to the British Pound and Euro, interest income of $5.1 million and a $3.6 million gain related to the sale of marketable equity securities, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $12.1 million related to the write-off of a proportionate share of original issue discount and deferred financing costs associated with prepayments of $440 million of the Match Group Term Loan, $10.0 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain cost method investments as a result of our assessment of the near-term prospects and financial condition of the investees, a loss of $3.8 million related to the sale of ASKfm and a $3.6 million loss on the 2013 and 2012 Senior Note redemptions and repurchases.

891103_17_ITEM7_P81_S2	Other expense, net in 2014 included $66.6 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain cost method investments and a $4.2 million other-than-temporary impairment charge on one of our equity method investments following the sale of a majority of the investee's assets, partially offset by a $19.4 million gain related to the sale of Urbanspoon, $4.4 million in interest income and $3.6 million in gains related to the sale of several long-term investments.
891103_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	In 2016, the Company recorded an income tax benefit for continuing operations of $64.9 million , which represents an effective income tax rate of 80%.
891103_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of ShoeBuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the Publishing segment.
891103_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	In 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $29.5 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 21%.
891103_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	The effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.
891103_17_ITEM7_P82_S4	In 2014, the Company recorded an income tax provision for continuing operations of $35.4 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 13%.
891103_17_ITEM7_P82_S5	The effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due principally to a reduction in tax reserves and related interest of $88.2 million due to the expiration of statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for 2001 through 2009 and foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by the largely unbenefited loss associated with the write-downs of certain of the Company's investments and non-deductible goodwill associated with the sale of Urbanspoon.
891103_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2014 was due to the release of tax reserves related to the expiration of the statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009.
891103_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders percentage share of earnings or losses from the subsidiaries in which the Company holds a majority, but less than 100 percent, ownership interest and the results of which are included in our consolidated financial statements.

891103_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	IAC'S PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING IAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_17_ITEM7_P87_S2	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_17_ITEM7_P87_S3	IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_17_ITEM7_P87_S4	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
891103_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Definition of IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_17_ITEM7_P88_S1	We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_17_ITEM7_P88_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_17_ITEM7_P88_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From IAC's Non-GAAP Measure Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance-based RSUs and market-based awards.
891103_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) has been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period).
891103_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Upon the exercise of certain stock options and vesting of RSUs, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards, the awards are settled, at the Company's discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
891103_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions.
891103_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as trade names, content, technology, customer lists, advertiser and supplier relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value.
891103_17_ITEM7_P95_S1	These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.
891103_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	The impact of foreign exchange rates on Match Group, due to its global reach, may be an important factor in understanding period over period comparisons if movement in rates is significant.
891103_17_ITEM7_P97_S0	impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies.
891103_17_ITEM7_P97_S1	We believe the presentation of revenue excluding foreign exchange, in addition to reported revenue, helps improve the ability to understand Match Group's performance because it excludes the impact of foreign currency volatility that is not indicative of Match Group's core operating results.
891103_17_ITEM7_P98_S0	Revenue, excluding foreign exchange impact compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period.
891103_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	Revenue, excluding foreign exchange impact is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P98_S2	Revenue growth, excluding foreign exchange impact (expressed as a percentage), is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P98_S3	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results reported in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP.
891103_17_ITEM7_P99_S0	The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Match Group revenue was not material to the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM7_P99_S1	The following table presents the impact of foreign exchange on Match Group consolidated revenue, Match Group Dating revenue and Match Group International Direct Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:

891103_17_ITEM7_P100_S2	(c) If needed for our U.S. operations, most of the cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, however, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes.
891103_17_ITEM7_P100_S3	We have not provided for any such tax because the Company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our U.S. operations and it is the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. (d) Marketable securities consist of commercial paper rated A1/P1, treasury discount notes, short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers and an equity security (which was sold in the second quarter of 2016).

891103_17_ITEM7_P101_S1	As a result, we cannot freely access the cash of Match Group and its subsidiaries.
891103_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Match Group generated $234.1 million and $209.1 million of operating cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

891103_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Match Group Senior Notes : On June 1, 2016, Match Group issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Match Group Senior Notes due June 1, 2024.

891103_17_ITEM7_P105_S1	Following the designation, neither Match Group nor any of its subsidiaries guarantee any debt of IAC, or are subject to any of the covenants related to such debt.
891103_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	The indentures governing the 2016 and 2015 Match Group Senior Notes contain covenants that would limit Match Group's ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem Match Group stock in the event a default has occurred or Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0.

891103_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company's principal sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as cash flows generated from operations.
891103_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	IAC has a $300 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020.
891103_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	Match Group has a $500 million revolving credit facility that expires on October 7, 2020.
891103_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	At December 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under the IAC Credit Facility or the Match Group Credit Facility.
891103_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	At December 31, 2016, IAC had 9.3 million shares remaining in its share repurchase authorization.
891103_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	IAC may purchase shares over an indefinite period of time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, depending on those factors IAC management deems relevant at any particular time, including, without limitation, market conditions, share price and future outlook.
891103_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	IAC's consolidated cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 were $1.3 billion, of which $253.7 million was held by Match Group.
891103_17_ITEM7_P128_S1	The Company generated $292.4 million of operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016, of which $234.1 million was generated by Match Group.
891103_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	Match Group is a separate and distinct legal entity with its own public shareholders and board of directors and has no obligation to provide the Company with funds.
891103_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	As a result, we cannot freely access the cash of the Match Group and its subsidiaries.
891103_17_ITEM7_P129_S2	In addition, agreements governing Match Group's indebtedness limit the payment of dividends or distributions and loans or advances to stockholders, including the Company, in the event a default has occurred or Match Group's leverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) exceeds 5.0 to 1.0.
891103_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Company anticipates that it will need to make capital and other expenditures in connection with the development and expansion of its operations.
891103_17_ITEM7_P130_S1	The Company's 2017 capital expenditures are expected to be higher than 2016 by approximately 5% to 10%, driven, in part, by certain Corporate related expenditures and HomeAdvisor's sales center and corporate headquarters expansion.
891103_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	Awards made under our subsidiary denominated equity plans are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in IAC shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment.
891103_17_ITEM7_P131_S1	Awards made to employees of Match Group subsidiaries may be settled in either IAC shares or Match Group shares, at our option.
891103_17_ITEM7_P131_S2	The tax withholding payment associated with these awards is made by the Company in cash on behalf of the employee at the time these awards are exercised; in the case of Match Group awards, the tax withholding payment is made by Match Group in cash at the time these awards are exercised.
891103_17_ITEM7_P131_S3	In either case, the cash tax withholding payments will vary based on the ultimate number of awards exercised, the intrinsic value of the awards upon exercise and relevant withholding tax rates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P131_S4	We expect a reduction in future corporate income taxes equal to a substantial portion of any such withholding tax payments by virtue of the income tax deduction we will recognize based on the intrinsic value of the awards at exercise.
891103_17_ITEM7_P131_S5	However, there may be some delay in the timing of the realization of the cash benefit of the income tax deduction because it will be dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and the timing of estimated income tax payments.
891103_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	As it relates to awards made to employees of Match Group subsidiaries, if the Company elects to settle these awards in IAC shares, we will receive Match Group shares equal in value to the IAC shares issued.
891103_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	If the Company elects to settle these awards in Match Group shares, our ownership interest in Match Group will be diluted.
891103_17_ITEM7_P132_S2	The Match Group subsidiary denominated equity plan at Tinder has a number of scheduled option exercise periods, and the next period is in May 2017; the Company expects to settle a sufficient number of exercises in IAC shares to maintain an economic interest in Match Group of at least 80%.
891103_17_ITEM7_P132_S3	See "Note 13 Stock-Based Compensation" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional discussion of subsidiary denominated equity plans.
891103_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.
891103_17_ITEM7_P133_S1	The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services.
891103_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	the event a default has occurred or in certain circumstances our leverage ratio (as defined in the indenture) exceeds 3.0 to 1.0.
891103_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	The Company may make additional acquisitions and investments and, as a result, the Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility.
891103_17_ITEM7_P135_S1	Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.
891103_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	The Company has excluded $37.8 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.
891103_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	(b) Represents contractual amounts due including interest on both fixed and variable rate instruments.
891103_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	Long-term debt at December 31, 2016 consists of $1.3 billion, which bears interest at fixed rates, and a $350 million Match Group Term Loan, which bears interest at a variable rate.
891103_17_ITEM7_P138_S1	The Match Group Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%, or 4.20%, at December 31, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM7_P138_S2	The amount of interest ultimately paid on the Match Group Term Loan may differ based on changes in interest rates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	(c) The Company leases land, office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with operations under various operating leases, many of which contain escalation clauses.
891103_17_ITEM7_P139_S1	The Company is also committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under a data center lease agreement.
891103_17_ITEM7_P139_S2	These operating expenses are not included in the table above.
891103_17_ITEM7_P139_S3	(d) The purchase obligations principally include a web hosting commitment.
891103_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (e) Commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require registrant performance in the event of demands by third parties or contingent events.
891103_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than the items described above, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in "Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_17_ITEM7_P143_S1	These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
891103_17_ITEM7_P143_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements Acquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy.
891103_17_ITEM7_P146_S1	The Company invested $18.4 million, $617.4 million and $259.4 million in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_17_ITEM7_P147_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_17_ITEM7_P147_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	In connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics.
891103_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM7_P149_S2	Determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective.
891103_17_ITEM7_P149_S3	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM7_P149_S4	The changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_17_ITEM7_P149_S5	See "Note 8 Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments" to the consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $320.6 million and $380.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7_P150_S2	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or, more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_17_ITEM7_P150_S3	In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_17_ITEM7_P150_S4	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2016, a qualitative assessment of the Match Group, HomeAdvisor Domestic, HomeAdvisor International, Vimeo, Daily Burn and ShoeBuy reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values.
891103_17_ITEM7_P150_S5	Th e primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units is described below:
891103_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	Match Group's October 1, 2016 market capitalization of $4.8 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 970% and Match Group's strong operating performance.
891103_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	The Company performed valuations of the HomeAdvisor Domestic, HomeAdvisor International, Vimeo and Daily Burn reporting units during 2016.
891103_17_ITEM7_P152_S1	These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the shares of these businesses.
891103_17_ITEM7_P152_S2	The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of October 1, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM7_P152_S3	The fair value of each of these businesses was significantly in excess of its October 1, 2016 carrying value.
891103_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	ShoeBuy's expected sales price was significantly in excess of its October 1, 2016 carrying value; which was confirmed by the sales price realized in its sale on December 30, 2016, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $37.5 million.
891103_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	When the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value goodwill must be tested for impairment.
891103_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2016, the Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the Applications and Connected Ventures reporting units were greater than their respective carrying values and performed a quantitative test of these reporting units.
891103_17_ITEM7_P154_S2	The Company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired.
891103_17_ITEM7_P154_S3	The Publishing reporting unit had no goodwill as of October 1, 2016 because the Company recorded an impairment charge equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill during the second quarter of 2016, which is more fully described below, following a quantitative impairment test as of June 30, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	The quantitative impairment test is performed using the two-step process described below.
891103_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	The first step of an annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year.
891103_17_ITEM7_P156_S2	The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen.
891103_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_17_ITEM7_P157_S2	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_17_ITEM7_P157_S3	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_17_ITEM7_P157_S4	The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units ranged from 10% to 17.5% in 2016 and 12% to 22% in 2015.
891103_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies.
891103_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.
891103_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
891103_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary.
891103_17_ITEM7_P160_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed.
891103_17_ITEM7_P160_S3	The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment, if any.
891103_17_ITEM7_P160_S4	The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.
891103_17_ITEM7_P160_S5	In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid.
891103_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	If the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
891103_17_ITEM7_P161_S1	The Company has adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, effective January 1, 2017.
891103_17_ITEM7_P161_S2	Therefore, any goodwill impairment charge that might result in the future would be determined based solely upon the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
891103_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	The second step of the impairment analysis that is described above will no longer be performed.
891103_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	At October 1, 2016, the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value by more than 20%.
891103_17_ITEM7_P163_S1	While the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible asset are less than its carrying value, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1.
891103_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_17_ITEM7_P164_S1	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2016 and 2015, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in 2016 and 1% to 9% in 2015.
891103_17_ITEM7_P167_S2	While the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets.
891103_17_ITEM7_P167_S3	The 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the Publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the ShoeBuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively .
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	Recoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S3	In addition, the Company reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S4	The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $341.1 million and $363.5 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S5	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S6	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S7	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_17_ITEM7_P168_S8	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance of deferred tax liabilities, net, is $226.3 million and $346.8 million, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process.
891103_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_17_ITEM7_P170_S1	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_17_ITEM7_P170_S2	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $41.0 million and $43.4 million, including interest, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
891103_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they become known.
891103_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	The ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	No income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $680.2 million at December 31, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings would be $169.3 million .
891103_17_ITEM7_P174_S2	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $104.8 million , $105.4 million and $59.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7_P174_S3	The Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued in 2016, 2015 and 2014 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model.
891103_17_ITEM7_P174_S4	For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term.
891103_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs.
891103_17_ITEM7_P175_S1	For RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term.
891103_17_ITEM7_P175_S2	For performance-based RSUs issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	Marketable Securities and Long-term Investments At December 31, 2016, marketable securities of $89.3 million consist of commercial paper rated A1/P1, treasury discount notes and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	Long-term investments at December 31, 2016 of $122.8 million include equity securities accounted for under the cost and equity methods.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S2	The Company invests in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity to fund current operations or satisfy other cash requirements as needed.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S3	Marketable securities are adjusted to fair value each quarter, and the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S4	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S5	The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S6	Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S7	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S8	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S9	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S10	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_17_ITEM7_P176_S11	During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $10.0 million, $6.7 million and $66.6 million, respectively, related to cost method investments.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and long-term debt, including current maturities.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which consist of money market funds, commercial paper, treasury discount notes and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	During 2016, the Company did not record any material other-than-temporary impairment charges related to its cash equivalents and marketable debt securities.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 2016, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by $0.1 million.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S6	However, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of $1.3 billion was invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S7	At December 31, 2016, the Company's outstanding debt was $1.6 billion (including $20.0 million of 2013 Senior Notes classified as current, pending redemption) of which $1.3 billion bears interest at fixed rates and $350 million Match Group Term Loan, which bears interest at a variable rate.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S8	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S9	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $53.9 million.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P1_S10	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Match Group Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 3.25%.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the rate in effect was 4.20%.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	If LIBOR were to increase by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense and payments on the Match Group Term Loan would increase by $3.5 million.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	If LIBOR were to decrease by 100 basis points, the effective interest rate would decrease by 20 basis points to the LIBOR floor of 0.75% and the annual interest expense and payments in the current year would decrease by $0.7 million.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the European Union, and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the Euro and British Pound ("GBP").
891103_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	For both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, international revenue accounted for 26% of consolidated revenue.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the Euro.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The average Euro versus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was essentially flat in 2016 compared to 2015.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Foreign currency exchange gains and losses included in the Company's earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are gains and (losses) of $34.4 million , $5.4 million and $(1.6) million , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Historically foreign currency exchange gains and losses have not been material to the Company, however, the significant decline in the GBP due to the Brexit vote, on June 23, 2016, generated significant foreign currency exchange gains during 2016.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P6_S3	This gain is primarily related to (1) U.S. dollar denominated cash, the majority of which is from the proceeds received in the PriceRunner sale in March 2016, held by a foreign subsidiary with a GBP functional currency and (2) a U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan related to a recent acquisition in which the receivable is held by a foreign subsidiary with a GBP functional currency.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P6_S4	If the GBP had declined 10% further versus the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016, the gain would have been greater by $2.0 million and if the GBP had declined 10% less versus the U.S. dollar the gain would have been reduced by $2.6 million.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exposures.
891103_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of IAC/InterActiveCorp We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of IAC/InterActiveCorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.

891103_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
891103_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
891103_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of IAC/InterActiveCorp and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
891103_17_ITEM8_P1_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), IAC/InterActiveCorp's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 28, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

891103_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial matters of the investee are accounted for using the cost method.
891103_17_ITEM8_P27_S2	Investments in companies that IAC does not control, which are not in the form of common stock or in-substance common stock, are also accounted for using the cost method.
891103_17_ITEM8_P27_S3	The Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognizes an impairment loss if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_17_ITEM8_P27_S4	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	If the Company has not identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of a cost method investment, then the fair value of such cost method investment is not estimated, as it is impracticable to do so.

891103_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_17_ITEM8_P43_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Certain Risks and Concentrations A significant portion of the Company's revenue is derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
891103_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	Significant changes in this industry or changes in advertising spending behavior or in customer buying behavior could adversely affect our operating results.
891103_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Most of the Company's online advertising revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google.
891103_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , revenue from Google represents 26% , 40% and 45% , respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenue.

891103_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	The services agreement requires that we comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google.
891103_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , revenue earned from Google is $824.4 million , $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively.

891103_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	Accounts receivable related to revenue earned from Google totaled $65.8 million and $97.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company's business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud.
891103_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
891103_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with financial institutions and are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S3	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S4	The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S5	The amounts of these reserves are based, in part, on historical experience.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S6	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including significant improvements, are recorded at cost.
891103_17_ITEM8_P50_S7	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

891103_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company capitalizes certain internal use software costs including external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the software and compensation for personnel directly associated with the development of the software.
891103_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
891103_17_ITEM8_P52_S2	The net book value of capitalized internal use software is $46.9 million and $39.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	In connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	Each of these arrangements are initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S3	The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S4	Determining the fair value of these arrangements is inherently difficult and subjective.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S5	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S6	The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P54_S7	See "Note 8 Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments" for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, or, more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	When the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise, a quantitative assessment is performed and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined.
891103_17_ITEM8_P55_S3	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is calculated (in the same manner as a business combination) and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_17_ITEM8_P55_S4	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2016, a qualitative assessment of the Match Group, HomeAdvisor Domestic, HomeAdvisor International, Vimeo, Daily Burn and ShoeBuy reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values.
891103_17_ITEM8_P55_S5	The primary fact ors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units is described below:
891103_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Match Group's October 1, 2016 market capitalization of $4.8 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 970% and Match Group's strong operating performance.
891103_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company performed valuations of the HomeAdvisor Domestic, HomeAdvisor International, Vimeo and Daily Burn reporting units during 2016.
891103_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the shares of these businesses.
891103_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of October 1, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM8_P57_S3	The fair value of each of these businesses was significantly in excess of its October 1, 2016 carrying value.
891103_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	ShoeBuy's expected sales price was significantly in excess of its October 1, 2016 carrying value; which was confirmed by the sales price realized in its sale on December 30, 2016, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $37.5 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2016, the Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the Applications and Connected Ventures reporting units were greater than their respective carrying values and performed a quantitative test of these reporting units.
891103_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired.
891103_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Publishing reporting unit had no goodwill as of October 1, 2016 because the Company recorded an impairment charge equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill during the second quarter of 2016, which is more fully described below, following a quantitative impairment test as of June 30, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year.
891103_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen.
891103_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_17_ITEM8_P61_S4	The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units ranged from 10% to 17.5% in 2016 and 12% to 22% in 2015 .
891103_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer gr oup of companies.
891103_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.
891103_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
891103_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	At October 1, 2016, the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value by more than 20% .
891103_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	While the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible asset are less than its carrying value, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1.
891103_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company determines the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using avoided royalty DCF analyses.
891103_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2016 and 2015 , and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in 2016 and 1% to 9% in 2015 .
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S3	While the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016 the Company recorded impairment charges related to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets.
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S4	The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing was driven by the impact from the new Google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the current estimate of fair value.
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S5	The expected cash flows used in the Publishing DCF analysis were based on the Company's most recent forecast for the second half of 2016 and each of the years in the forecast period, which were updated to include the effects of the new Google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the cost savings from our restructuring efforts.
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S6	For years beyond the forecast period, the Company's estimated cash flows were based on forecasted growth rates.
891103_17_ITEM8_P67_S7	The discount rate used in the DCF analysis reflected the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the Publishing reporting unit.
891103_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies.
891103_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple was determined which was applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of the Publishing reporting unit.
891103_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for Publishing, we considered companies relevant in terms of business model, revenue profile, margin and growth characteristics and brand strength.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge related to certain trade names and trademarks and were due to reduced level of revenue and profits, which, in turn, also led to a reduction in the assumed royalty rates for these assets.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	The royalty rates used to value the trade names that were impaired ranged from 2% to 6% and the discount rate that was used reflected the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the trade names and trademarks.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S2	The impairment charge is included in "Amortization of intangibles" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S3	In 2015, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges of $88.0 million related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets at the Publishing segment and $14.1 million at the Other segment related to goodwill at ShoeBuy.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S4	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at Publishing related to certain trade names of certain Ask Other direct marketing brands, including Ask.com.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S5	The impairment charge reflected the impact of Google ecosystem changes that have impacted our ability to market, the effect of the reduced revenue share on mobile under the terms of the services agreement with Google, and the shift in focus to higher margin businesses in Publishing's Premium Brands.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S6	The combined impact of these factors has reduced the forecasted revenue and profits for these brands and the impairment charge reflected the resultant reduction in fair value.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S7	The goodwill impairment charge at ShoeBuy was due to increased investment and the seasonal effect of high inventory levels as of October 1, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM8_P70_S8	The 2014 annual assessment identified no material impairments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Company's reporting units are consistent with its determination of its operating segments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
891103_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	See "Note 14 Segment Information" for additional information regarding the Company's method of determining operating and reportable segments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Definite Lives Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is computed either on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset will be realized.
891103_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	The fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.
891103_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	Certain of these securities may have different market prices from multiple market data sources, in which case an average market price is used.
891103_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
891103_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	See "Note 8 Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments" for a discussion of fair value measurements made using Level 3 inputs.
891103_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company's non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets and property and equipment, as well as equity and cost method investments, are adjusted to fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.
891103_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.
891103_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	Traffic Acquisition Costs Traffic acquisition costs consist of (i) payments made to partners who distribute our Partnerships customized browser-based applications and who integrate our paid listings into their websites and (ii) fees related to the distribution and facilitation of in-app purchase of product features.
891103_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	These payments include amounts based on revenue share and other arrangements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P80_S2	The Company expenses these payments in the period incurred as a component of cost of revenue.
891103_17_ITEM8_P80_S3	Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed in the period incurred (when the advertisement first runs for production costs that are initially capitalized) and represent online marketing, including fees paid to search engines and third parties that distribute our Consumer downloadable applications, offline marketing, which is primarily television advertising, and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to the Match Group brands.
891103_17_ITEM8_P80_S4	Advertising expense is $1.0 billion , $1.2 billion and $994.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company capitalizes and amortizes the costs associated with certain distribution arrangements that require it to pay a fee per access point delivered.
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	These access points are generally in the form of downloadable applications associated with our Consumer operations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	These fees are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent the Company can reasonably estimate a probable future economic benefit and the period over which such benefit will be realized (generally 18 months).
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S3	Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred.
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S4	Legal Costs Legal costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S5	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S6	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_17_ITEM8_P81_S7	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company records interest, net of any applicable related income tax benefit, on potential income tax contingencies as a component of income tax expense.
891103_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process.
891103_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
891103_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
891103_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to IAC shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
891103_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vested resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company.
891103_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	The financial position and operating results of foreign entities whose primary economic environment is based on their local currency are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency.
891103_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	are translated at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, and local currency revenue and expenses of these operations are translated at average rates of exchange during the period.
891103_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders' equity.
891103_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	Transaction gains and losses resulting from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of other income (expense), net.
891103_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	See "Note 20 Consolidated Financial Statement Details" for additional information regarding foreign currency exchange gains and losses.
891103_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Translation gains and losses relating to foreign entities that are liquidated or substantially liquidated are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings.
891103_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	Such gains totaled $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and is included in "Other income (expense), net" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the requisite service period.
891103_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	See "Note 13 Stock-based Compensation" for a discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.
891103_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Noncontrolling interests in the consolidated subsidiaries of the Company are ordinarily reported on the consolidated balance sheet within shareholders' equity, separately from the Company's equity.
891103_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	However, securities that are redeemable at the option of the holder and not solely within the control of the issuer must be classified outside of shareholders' equity.
891103_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	Accordingly, all noncontrolling interests that are redeemable at the option of the holder are presented outside of shareholders' equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	In connection with the acquisition of certain subsidiaries, management of these businesses has retained an ownership interest.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Company is party to fair value put and call arrangements with respect to these interests.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	These put and call arrangements allow management of these businesses to require the Company to purchase their interests or allow the Company to acquire such interests at fair value, respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S3	The put arrangements do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument as the put agreements do not provide for net settlement.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S4	These put and call arrangements become exercisable by the Company and the counter-party at various dates in the future.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, one and two of these arrangements, respectively, were exercised.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S6	No put or call arrangements were exercised during 2014.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S7	These put arrangements are exercisable by the counter-party outside the control of the Company.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S8	Accordingly, to the extent that the fair value of these interests exceeds the value determined by normal noncontrolling interest accounting, the value of such interests is adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
891103_17_ITEM8_P90_S9	During the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the Company recorded adjustments of $7.9 million , $23.2 million and $27.8 million , respectively, to increase these interests to fair value.
891103_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	Fair value determinations require high levels of judgment and are based on various valuation techniques, including market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.
891103_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	Noncontrolling Interests During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the Company reallocated amounts within the accounts comprising shareholders' equity to correct the amount of noncontrolling interests that was initially recorded following the IPO of Match Group, which occurred on November 24, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	The noncontrolling interests should have been recorded using the net book value of Match Group rather than the net IPO proceeds.
891103_17_ITEM8_P92_S2	In addition, the adjustment allocates the proportionate share of the accumulated other comprehensive loss to the noncontrolling interests balance.
891103_17_ITEM8_P92_S3	The reallocation has no effect on net income or earnings per share.
891103_17_ITEM8_P92_S4	Based on our assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, the reallocation was not considered material to the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016, or any of the interim reporting periods included therein, and for the year ended December 31, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM8_P92_S5	Therefore, the adjustment was initially reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and was also reflected in the year-to-date consolidated financial statements of each subsequent interim period in 2016 and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common standard for all industries.
891103_17_ITEM8_P93_S1	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year.
891103_17_ITEM8_P93_S2	In March, April, May and December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-12 and ASU No. 2016-20, respectively, which provide further revenue recognition guidance related to principal versus agent considerations, performance obligations and licensing, and narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients.
891103_17_ITEM8_P93_S3	Early adoption is permitted beginning on the original effective date of December 15, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	Upon adoption, ASU No. 2014-09 may either be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application.
891103_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company will adopt ASU No. 2014-09, as amended by ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-12 and ASU No. 2016-20, using the modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2018.
891103_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of these standard updates will have on its consolidated financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases in "Leases (Topic 840)" and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the statement of financial position.
891103_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	The provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted.
891103_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	The provisions of ASU No. 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
891103_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard update will have on its consolidated financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payments Accounting (Topic 718).
891103_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	The update is intended to simplify existing guidance on various aspects of the accounting and presentation of employee share-based payments in financial statements including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification on the statement of cash flows.
891103_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	The provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; early adoption is permitted.
891103_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	The primary effects of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 on the Company s results of operations, cash flows and earnings per share will be due to the change in the treatment of the excess tax benefit (deficiency) related to equity awards to employees upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units.
891103_17_ITEM8_P98_S1	The table below illustrates this effect.
891103_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	Excess tax benefit (deficiency) of equity awards to employees upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units:
891103_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	The expected effect of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 for the Company will be to increase reported net earnings (or reduce reported net loss), operating cash flow and basic earnings per share (or reduce reported net loss per share).
891103_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	The number of shares used in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share will also increase due to the reduction in assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method.
891103_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	The actual effect on fully diluted earnings per share could be an increase or a decrease in any period, which will depend upon the increase in reported earnings and the increase in the number of shares included in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation.
891103_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	As of January 1, 2017, the Company will adopt the change in treatment of excess tax benefit (deficiency) using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial adoption and will apply the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 related to the presentation on the statement of cash flows using the retrospective approach.
891103_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	To illustrate the effect of ASU No. 2016-09 on the Company s results for the year ended December 31, 2016, the table below illustrates the change in the Company s reported results after giving pro forma effect to ASU No. 2016-09 as if it had been in effect on January 1, 2016.
891103_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	In August 2016, the FASB ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which makes clarifications to how cash receipts and cash payments in certain transactions are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows.
891103_17_ITEM8_P102_S1	The provisions of ASU No. 2016-15 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, and will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable; early adoption is permitted.
891103_17_ITEM8_P102_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and is currently evaluating the method and timing of adoption.
891103_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment , which is intended to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment.
891103_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	The guidance will eliminate the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill under today s two-step impairment test to measure a goodwill impairment charge.
891103_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	The provisions of ASU No. 2017-04 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted.
891103_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	The provisions of ASU 2017-04 are to be applied using a prospective approach.
891103_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	The Company will adopt the provisions of ASU 2017-04 on January 1, 2017 and does not expect the adoption of this standard update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P105_S2	Accounting Pronouncement adopted by the Company In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements .
891103_17_ITEM8_P105_S3	Together, this guidance requires that deferred debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums, while debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements may still continue to be classified as assets.
891103_17_ITEM8_P105_S4	The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15 in the first quarter of 2016 and applied the provisions retrospectively, resulting in $21.3 million of deferred debt issuance costs being reclassified from other non-current assets to long-term debt, net of current portion, in the accompanying December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet.
891103_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
891103_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	NOTE 3 INCOME TAXES U.S. and foreign (loss) earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are as follows:
891103_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	The components of the (benefit) provision for income taxes attributable to continuing operations are as follows:
891103_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	The current income tax payable was reduced by $51.8 million , $56.4 million and $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, for excess tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation.
891103_17_ITEM8_P109_S1	The related income tax benefits are recorded as increases to additional paid-in capital.
891103_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	Income taxes receivable (payable) and deferred tax assets (liabilities) are included in the following captions in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
891103_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	The tax effects of cumulative temporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below.
891103_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	The valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	At December 31, 2016 , the Company has federal and state net operating losses ("NOLs") of $71.8 million and $123.5 million , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	state NOLs will expire at various times between 2017 and 2036.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	Utilization of federal and state NOLs will be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state law.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the Company has foreign NOLs of $126.3 million available to offset future income.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	Of these foreign NOLs, $112.4 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $13.9 million will expire at various times between 2017 and 2036.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S3	During 2016 , the Company recognized tax benefits related to NOLs of $19.8 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S4	At December 31, 2016 , the Company has federal and state capital losses of $16.5 million and $26.2 million , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S5	If not utilized, the capital losses will expire between 2017 and 2021.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S6	Utilization of capital losses will be limited to the Company's ability to generate future capital gains.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S7	At December 31, 2016 , the Company has tax credit carryforwards of $18.3 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S8	Of this amount, $9.1 million relates to state tax credits for research activities, $3.9 million relates to federal credits for foreign taxes, and $5.3 million relates to various state and local tax credits.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S9	Of these credit carryforwards, $11.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $7.3 million will expire primarily by 2018.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S10	During 2016 , the Company's valuation allowance decreased by $2.3 million primarily due to the decrease in state and foreign net operating losses and foreign tax credits, partially offset by an increase in federal and state capital losses and other-than-temporary impairment charges on certain cost method investments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P115_S11	At December 31, 2016 , the Company has a valuation allowance of $88.2 million related to the portion of tax loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized.
891103_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	A reconciliation of the income tax (benefit) provision to the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes is shown as follows:
891103_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	No income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating $680.2 million at December 31, 2016 .
891103_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such earnings would be $169.3 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties but excluding interest, is as follows:

891103_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Company is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax.
891103_17_ITEM8_P120_S1	These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions.
891103_17_ITEM8_P120_S2	The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing the Company s federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2010 through 2012.

891103_17_ITEM8_P120_S6	Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of audits and amounts previously provided may be material.

891103_17_ITEM8_P120_S9	If unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 are subsequently recognized, $37.7 million , net of related deferred tax assets and interest, would reduce income tax expense for continuing operations.
891103_17_ITEM8_P120_S10	The comparable amount as of December 31, 2015 was $41.0 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P120_S11	The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by $6.9 million by December 31, 2017, due to settlements and expirations of statutes of limitations; all of which would reduce the income tax provision for continuing operations.

891103_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	The purchase price was based on the expected financial performance of PlentyOfFish, not on the value of the net identifiable assets at the time of acquisition, which resulted in a significant portion of the purchase price being attributed to goodwill.
891103_17_ITEM8_P123_S1	The expected financial performance of PlentyOfFish reflects that it is complementary and synergistic to the existing Match Group dating businesses.
891103_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	PlentyOfFish's other current assets, property and equipment, other non-current assets, current liabilities and other long-term liabilities were reviewed and adjusted to their fair values at the date of acquisition, as necessary.
891103_17_ITEM8_P124_S1	The fair values of trade names, customer relationships and the non-compete agreement were determined using variations of the income approach; specifically, in respective order, the relief from royalty, excess earnings and with or without methodologies.
891103_17_ITEM8_P124_S2	The fair values of new registrants and developed technology were determined using a cost approach that utilized the cost to replace methodology.
891103_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	The valuations of the intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require significant judgment and estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows and the determination of royalty and discount rates.

891103_17_ITEM8_P175_S0	_________________________ (a) Amount is net of a tax provision of $0.2 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P176_S0	_________________________ (b) Amount is net of a tax provision of $0.1 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to IAC shareholders.
891103_17_ITEM8_P178_S0	__________________________________________________________________ (a) Represents the impact on earnings related to Match Group's dilutive securities under the if-converted method.
891103_17_ITEM8_P178_S1	(b) The impact on earnings of Match Group's dilutive securities is not applicable for the year ended December 31, 2014 as it was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company until its IPO on November 24, 2015.
891103_17_ITEM8_P178_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016, the impact on earnings related to Match Group's dilutive securities under the if-converted method is excluded as the impact is anti-dilutive.
891103_17_ITEM8_P178_S3	(c) For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a loss from continuing operations; therefore, approximately 11.3 million potentially dilutive securities were excluded from computing dilutive earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_17_ITEM8_P178_S4	Accordingly, the weighted average basic shares outstanding were used to compute all earnings per share amounts.
891103_17_ITEM8_P178_S5	(d) If the effect is dilutive, weighted average common shares outstanding include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of subsidiary denominated equity, stock options and vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs").
891103_17_ITEM8_P179_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 1.2 million and 0.3 million potentially dilutive securities, respectively, are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_17_ITEM8_P180_S0	(e) Market-based awards and performance-based stock units ( PSUs ) are considered contingently issuable shares.
891103_17_ITEM8_P180_S1	Market-based awards and PSUs are included in the denominator for earnings per share if (i) the applicable market or performance condition(s) has been met and (ii) the inclusion of the market-based awards and PSUs are dilutive for the respective reporting periods.

891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S2	These plans authorize the Company to grant awards to its employees, officers, directors and consultants.
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S3	At December 31, 2016 , there are 5.9 million shares available for grant under the plans.
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S4	The plans were adopted in 2008 and 2013, have a stated term of ten years , and provide that the exercise price of stock options granted will not be less than the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date.
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S5	The plans do not specify grant dates or vesting schedules of awards as those determinations have been delegated to the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of IAC's Board of Directors (the "Committee").
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S6	Each grant agreement reflects the vesting schedule for that particular grant as determined by the Committee.
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S7	Broad-based stock option awards issued to date have generally vested in equal annual installments over a four -year period and RSU awards currently outstanding generally vest in three 33% installments over a three -year period, in each case, from the grant date.
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S8	The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is reduced by estimated forfeitures, as the expense recorded is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S9	The forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated rate.
891103_17_ITEM8_P181_S10	At December 31, 2016 , there is $177.9 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.6 years.

891103_17_ITEM8_P183_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between IAC's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2016 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2016 .
891103_17_ITEM8_P183_S1	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is $17.1 million , $53.0 million and $63.3 million , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P183_S2	The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2016 :
891103_17_ITEM8_P184_S0	The fair value of stock option awards, with the exception of market-based awards, is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
891103_17_ITEM8_P184_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_17_ITEM8_P184_S2	During 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.
891103_17_ITEM8_P184_S3	The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasuries with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date.
891103_17_ITEM8_P184_S4	Expected term is based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees and the dividend yields are based on IAC's historical dividend payments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P185_S0	The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
891103_17_ITEM8_P186_S0	During 2015, the Company granted market-based stock options to certain employees.
891103_17_ITEM8_P186_S1	These awards only vest if the price of IAC common stock exceeds the relevant price threshold for a twenty -day consecutive period and the service requirement is met.
891103_17_ITEM8_P186_S2	The service requirement provides that these awards vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
891103_17_ITEM8_P186_S3	The grant date fair value of each market-based award is estimated using a lattice model that incorporates a Monte Carlo simulation of IAC's stock price.
891103_17_ITEM8_P186_S4	The inputs used to fair value these awards include a weighted average expected volatility of 27% , risk-free interest rate of 2.3% and a 1.8% dividend yield.
891103_17_ITEM8_P186_S5	The expected term of these awards is derived from the output of the option valuation model.
891103_17_ITEM8_P187_S0	Expense is recognized over the longer of the vesting period of each of the four installments or the expected term.
891103_17_ITEM8_P187_S1	The weighted average expected term of these awards is 4 years .
891103_17_ITEM8_P187_S2	Approximately 1.7 million , 2.5 million and 0.7 million stock options were granted by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P187_S3	The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 with exercise prices equal to the market prices of IAC's common stock on the date of grant are $12.34 , $15.24 and $16.67 , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P187_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the weighted average exercise price and weighted average fair value of stock options granted with exercise prices greater than the market value of IAC's common stock on the date of grant are $84.31 and $12.00 , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P187_S5	Cash received from stock option exercises and the related tax benefit realized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are: $25.8 million and $6.1 million ; $27.3 million and $25.8 million ; and $39.1 million and $25.5 million , respectively.
891103_17_ITEM8_P188_S0	In January 2014, a portion of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer (the "Executive") who became the Chairman of Match Group outstanding IAC stock options were canceled and replaced with equity denominated in Match Group and various subsidiaries of Match Group.
891103_17_ITEM8_P188_S1	The incremental expense associated with this modification was $7.4 million .
891103_17_ITEM8_P189_S0	IAC Restricted Stock Units and Performance-based Stock Units RSUs and PSUs are awards in the form of phantom shares or units denominated in a hypothetical equivalent number of shares of IAC common stock and with the value of each RSU and PSU equal to the fair value of IAC common stock at the date of grant.
891103_17_ITEM8_P189_S1	Each RSU and PSU grant is subject to service-based vesting, where a specific period of continued employment must pass before an award vests.
891103_17_ITEM8_P189_S2	PSUs also include performance-based vesting, where certain performance targets set at the time of grant must be achieved before an award vests.
891103_17_ITEM8_P190_S0	For RSU grants, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term.
891103_17_ITEM8_P190_S1	For PSU grants, the expense is measured at the grant date as the fair value of IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term if the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved.
891103_17_ITEM8_P190_S2	Unvested RSUs and PSUs outstanding at December 31, 2016 and changes during the year ended December 31, 2016 are as follows:
891103_17_ITEM8_P191_S0	The weighted average fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 based on market prices of IAC's common stock on the grant date was $46.92 , $67.71 and $68.13 , respectively.

891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S3	The value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries.
891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S4	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S5	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S6	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration, at various dates through 2026.
891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S7	These equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment.
891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S8	The number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly from the estimated numbers below as a result of both movements in our stock price and a determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than our estimate.
891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S9	The expense associated with these equity awards is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is expensed as stock-based compensation over the vesting term.
891103_17_ITEM8_P193_S10	The aggregate number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests, other than for Match Group subsidiaries, at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests (which will be reduced by the number of shares withheld to cover employee withholding taxes), at December 31, 2016 is 2.8 million shares, which is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share, if the effect is dilutive.

891103_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with how the chief operating decision maker views the businesses, how the businesses are organized as to segment management, and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_17_ITEM8_P198_S1	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of the Other reportable segment, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate operating segments.
891103_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (a) The Company's primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_17_ITEM8_P199_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_17_ITEM8_P199_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_17_ITEM8_P200_S1	(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.

891103_17_ITEM8_P208_S1	The Company establishes reserves for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable.
891103_17_ITEM8_P208_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_17_ITEM8_P208_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_17_ITEM8_P208_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss.

891103_17_ITEM9A_P6_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
891103_17_ITEM9A_P6_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

891103_17_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_17_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
891103_17_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

891103_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	All references to IAC, the Company, we, our or us in this report are to IAC/InterActiveCorp.
891103_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our History IAC, initially a hybrid media/electronic retailing company, was incorporated in 1986 in Delaware under the name Silver King Broadcasting Company, Inc.
891103_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	After several name changes (first to HSN, Inc., then to USA Networks, Inc., USA Interactive and InterActiveCorp, and finally, to IAC/InterActiveCorp) and the completion of a number of significant corporate transactions over the years, the Company transformed itself into a leading media and Internet company.
891103_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	From 1997 through 2002, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Ticketmaster Group, Hotel Reservations Network (later renamed Hotels.com) and Expedia, as well as acquired Match.com and other smaller e-commerce companies.
891103_18_ITEM1_P1_S3	In 2002, the Company contributed its entertainment assets to Vivendi Universal Entertainment LLLP, a joint venture, and sold its interests in that venture to NBC Universal in 2005.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	In 2003, the Company continued to grow its portfolio of e-commerce companies by acquiring all of the shares of Expedia, Hotels.com and Ticketmaster that it did not previously own, together with a number of other e-commerce companies (including LendingTree and Hotwire).
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S1	In 2005, IAC acquired Ask Jeeves, Inc. and completed the separation of its travel and travel related businesses and investments into an independent public company called Expedia, Inc.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2008, IAC separated into five independent, publicly traded companies: IAC, HSN, Inc., Interval Leisure Group, Inc., Ticketmaster (now part of Live Nation, Inc.) and Tree.com, Inc.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S3	In 2009, we sold the European operations of Match.com to Meetic, a leading European online dating company based in France, in exchange for a 27% interest in Meetic and a 5 million note.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S4	In 2010, we exchanged the stock of a wholly-owned subsidiary that held our Evite, Gifts.com and IAC Advertising Solutions businesses and approximately $218 million in cash for substantially all of Liberty Media Corporation s equity stake in IAC.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S5	In 2011, we increased our ownership stake in Meetic to 81%.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S6	In 2012, we acquired About.com (now known as Dotdash).
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S7	In 2014, we acquired the remaining publicly traded shares of Meetic, ValueClick s owned and operated website businesses, including Investopedia and PriceRunner, and The Princeton Review.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S8	In 2015, we acquired Plentyoffish Media Inc., a leading provider of subscription-based and ad-supported online personals servicing North America, Europe, Latin America and Australia, for $575 million in cash, and completed the initial public offering of Match Group, Inc.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S9	In 2016, we acquired VHX, a platform for premium over-the-top (OTT) subscription video channels, as well as a controlling interest in MyHammer Holding AG, the leading home services marketplace in Germany, and sold PriceRunner, ASKfm and ShoeBuy.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S10	In 2017, we acquired controlling interests in HomeStars Inc. and MyBuilder Limited, leading home services platforms in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively, as well as sold The Princeton Review.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S11	We also completed the combination of the businesses in our former HomeAdvisor segment with those of Angie s List, Inc. under a new publicly traded holding company that we control, ANGI Homeservices Inc.
891103_18_ITEM1_P2_S12	Lastly, through our Vimeo subsidiary, we acquired Livestream Inc., a leading live video solution.

891103_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	All of our dating products enable users to establish a profile and review the profiles of other users without charge.
891103_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	Each product also offers additional features, some of which are free and some of which are paid, depending on the particular product.
891103_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	In general, access to premium features requires a subscription, which is typically offered in packages (primarily ranging from one month to six months), depending on the product and circumstance.
891103_18_ITEM1_P5_S4	Prices differ meaningfully within a given brand by the duration of subscription purchased, the bundle of paid features that a user chooses to access and whether or not a subscriber is taking advantage of any special offers.
891103_18_ITEM1_P5_S5	In addition to subscriptions, many of our dating products offer users certain features, such as the ability to promote themselves for a given period of time or to review certain profiles without any signaling to other users, and these features are offered on a pay per use (or la carte) basis.
891103_18_ITEM1_P5_S6	The precise mix of paid and premium features is established over time on a brand by brand basis and is constantly subject to iteration and evolution.
891103_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Revenue Match Group revenue is primarily derived directly from users in the form of recurring subscriptions.
891103_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Revenue is also earned from online advertising, the purchase of la carte features (where users pay a non-recurring fee for a specific action or event) and offline events.
891103_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	Marketing We attract the majority of users of our dating products through word-of-mouth and other free channels.
891103_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	In addition, many of our brands rely on paid user acquisition efforts for a significant percentage of their users.
891103_18_ITEM1_P7_S2	Our online marketing activities generally consist of purchasing social media advertising, banner and other display advertising, search engine marketing, e-mail campaigns, video advertising, business development or partnership deals and hiring influencers to promote our dating products.

891103_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Competition The dating industry is competitive and has no single, dominant brand globally.
891103_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	We compete with a number of other companies that provide similar dating and matchmaking products.
891103_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	In addition to other online dating brands, we compete with social media platforms and offline dating services, such as in person matchmakers.
891103_18_ITEM1_P8_S3	Arguably, our biggest competition in the case of our dating business comes from the traditional ways that people meet each other and the choices some people make to not utilize dating products or services.
891103_18_ITEM1_P8_S4	We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the case of our dating business will depend primarily upon the following factors:
891103_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	the design and functionality of our dating products.
891103_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Lastly, we believe our broad portfolio of dating brands is a competitive advantage, given that a large portion of online dating customers use multiple dating products over a given period of time, either concurrently or sequentially.

891103_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	These applications include: FromDoctoPDF , through which users can convert documents from one format into various others and share them across multiple platforms; MapsGalaxy , through which users can access accurate street maps, local traffic conditions and aerial and satellite street views; and WeatherBlink , through which users can access local weather conditions and satellite radar maps directly from their web browsers.
891103_18_ITEM1_P53_S3	Other applications target users with a special or passionate interest in select vertical categories (such as recipes, entertainment and astrology, among others) or provide users with particular reference information or access to specific capabilities (such as internet speed, online forms and package tracking, among others).
891103_18_ITEM1_P53_S4	We distribute these applications directly to consumers free of charge.
891103_18_ITEM1_P53_S5	The Consumer business also includes: (i) Apalon, a mobile development company with one of the largest and most popular portfolios of mobile applications worldwide and (ii) SlimWare, a provider of community-powered software and services that clean, repair, update, secure and optimize computers, mobile phones and digital devices.
891103_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Partnerships Through our Partnerships business, we work closely with partners in the software, media and other industries to design and develop customized browser-based search applications to be bundled and distributed with these partners products and services.
891103_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Substantially all of the Applications segment's revenue consists of advertising revenue generated principally through the display of paid listings in response to search queries.
891103_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	Paid listings are advertisements displayed on search results pages that generally contain a link to advertiser websites.
891103_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	Paid listings are generally displayed based on keywords selected by advertisers.
891103_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	The substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our Applications businesses are supplied to us by Google Inc. ("Google") in the manner provided by and pursuant to a services agreement with Google, which expires on March 31, 2020.
891103_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	The Company may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
891103_18_ITEM1_P56_S4	Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Applications businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results.
891103_18_ITEM1_P56_S5	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages.
891103_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Applications businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us.
891103_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	We recognize paid listing revenue from Google when it delivers the user's click.
891103_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	In cases where the user s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs.
891103_18_ITEM1_P57_S4	See Item 1A-Risk Factors-We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	To a significantly lesser extent, the Applications segment's revenue also consists of fees related to subscription downloadable applications and services, fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications and display advertisements.
891103_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Competition We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to develop, market and distribute applications and related technology directly and through third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	Competitors of our Applications businesses include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other third party browser extension, convenience search and desktop and mobile applications providers, as well as other search technology and convenience service providers.
891103_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Applications businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	We believe that the ability of our Applications businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon our continued ability to:
891103_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	market and distribute our browser extensions and other applications directly to consumers in a cost-effective manner.
891103_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	our Ask Other business, which primarily includes Ask Media Group, CityGrid and, for periods prior to its sale on June 30, 2016, ASKfm.
891103_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	Our Publishing businesses publish digital content and/or provide search services to users.
891103_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	Those of our Publishing businesses that publish digital content (our Premium Brands) generate such content through various sources, including, for example, through a combination of internal and independent freelance subject matter "experts" in the case of Dotdash and internal editorial staff in the case of The Daily Beast, and/or acquire such content (or the rights to publish such content) from third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	Those of our Publishing businesses that provide search services generally generate and display of a set of algorithmic search results, or hyperlinks to websites deemed relevant to search queries entered by users.
891103_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition to these algorithmic search results, paid listings are also generally displayed in response to search queries.
891103_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	The paid listings displayed by our Publishing businesses are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above.
891103_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	Our Premium Brands business primarily consists of the following businesses:
891103_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Daily Beast, a website dedicated to news, commentary, culture and entertainment that curates and publishes existing and original online content from its own roster of contributors in the United States.
891103_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Ask Other Our Ask Other business consists primarily of:
891103_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	CityGrid, an advertising network that integrates local content and advertising for distribution to affiliated and third party publishers across web and mobile platforms.
891103_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Revenue The Publishing segment's revenue consists principally of advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings in response to search queries, display advertisements (sold directly and through programmatic ad sales) and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications.
891103_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	The substantial majority of the paid listings that our Publishing businesses display are supplied to us by Google in the manner provided by and pursuant to our services agreement with Google, which is described above.
891103_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Competition We compete with a wide variety of parties in connection with our efforts to attract and retain users and advertisers to our Publishing businesses.
891103_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	In terms of publishing digital content, our competitors include destination websites that primarily acquire traffic through paid and algorithmic search results in relevant vertical categories and social channels.
891103_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	In terms of providing search services, generally our competitors include Google, Yahoo!, Bing and other destination search websites and search-centric portals (some of which provide a broad range of content and services and/or link to various desktop applications).
891103_18_ITEM1_P69_S3	Moreover, some of the current and potential competitors of our Publishing businesses have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and/or significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
891103_18_ITEM1_P69_S4	As a result, they have the ability to devote comparatively greater resources to the development and promotion of their products and services, which could result in greater market acceptance of their products and services relative to those offered by us.
891103_18_ITEM1_P69_S5	We believe that the ability of our Publishing businesses to compete successfully will depend primarily upon:
891103_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	our ability to successfully market the content and search services offered by our Publishing businesses in a cost-effective manner.
891103_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Other Our Other segment consisted of The Princeton Review, which provided a variety of educational test preparation, academic tutoring and college counseling services, ShoeBuy, an Internet retailer of footwear and related apparel and accessories, and PriceRunner, a shopping comparison website.
891103_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	The Princeton Review, ShoeBuy and PriceRunner were sold in March 2017, December 2016 and March 2016, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2017, IAC and its subsidiaries employed approximately 7,000 employees.
891103_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	We believe that we generally have good relationships with our employees.
891103_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	Additional Information Company Website and Public Filings.

891103_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	This annual report on Form 10-K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The use of words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, plans and believes, among others, generally identify forward-looking statements.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements relating to: IAC s future financial performance, IAC s business prospects and strategy, anticipated trends and prospects in the industries in which IAC s businesses operate and other similar matters.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These forward-looking statements are based on IAC management's expectations and assumptions about future events as of the date of this annual report, which are inherently subject to uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict.

891103_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Other unknown or unpredictable factors that could also adversely affect IAC s business, financial condition and results of operations may arise from time to time.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward looking statements discussed in this annual report may not prove to be accurate.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which only reflect the views of IAC management as of the date of this annual report.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	IAC does not undertake to update these forward looking statements.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risk Factors Our success depends, in substantial part, on our continued ability to market, distribute and monetize our products and services through search engines, social media platforms and digital app stores.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The marketing, distribution and monetization of our products and services depends on our ability to cultivate and maintain cost-effective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with search engines, social media platforms and digital app stores, in particular, those operated by Google, Facebook and Apple.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These platforms could decide not to market and distribute some or all of our products and services, change their terms and conditions of use at any time (and without notice), favor their own products and services over ours and/or significantly increase their fees.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	While we expect to maintain cost-effective and otherwise satisfactory relationships with these platforms, no assurances can be provided that we will be able to do so and our inability to do so in the case of one or more of these platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The risk factors below discuss these risks in the case of certain of our businesses in greater detail.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our success depends, in part, upon the continued migration of certain markets and industries online and the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services as effective alternatives to traditional offline products and services.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Through our various businesses, we provide a variety of online products and services that continue to compete with their traditional offline counterparts.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	We believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online products and services generally will depend, to a large extent, on the continued growth in commercial use of the Internet (particularly abroad) and the continued migration of traditional offline markets and industries online.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	For example, the success of the businesses within our Match Group segment depends, in substantial part, on the continued migration of the dating market online.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	We believe this migration will be driven, in substantial part, by the continued proliferation of mobile devices worldwide, which continues to expand the ways in which people can interact and build relationships, and increasing social acceptance and adoption of online dating products generally.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	The success of these businesses will also depend, in part, on our ability to continue to provide dating products that users find more efficient, effective, comfortable and convenient relative to traditional means of meeting people.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P3_S6	The failure of a meaningful number of users to embrace our dating products and/or the return of a meaningful number of users to offline dating products and services could adversely affect the businesses within our Match Group segment, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Similarly, the success of the businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment depends, in substantial part, on the continued migration of the home services market online.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We believe that the digital penetration of the home services market remains low, with the vast majority of consumers continuing to search for, select and hire service professionals offline.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	While many consumer demographics have historically been (and remain) averse to finding service professionals online, others have demonstrated a greater willingness to embrace the online shift (for example, millennials).
891103_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Service professionals must also embrace the online shift, which will depend, in substantial part, on whether online products and services help them to better connect and engage with consumers relative to traditional offline efforts.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	The speed and ultimate outcome of the shift of the home services market online for consumers and service professionals is uncertain and may not occur as quickly as we expect or at all.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	affect the businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Lastly, our success also depends, in part, on our ability to compete for a share of available advertising expenditures as more traditional offline and emerging media companies continue to enter the online advertising market, as well as the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	In addition to the factors discussed above in the case of online products and services generally, we believe that the continued growth and acceptance of online advertising generally will depend, in large part, on its perceived effectiveness and the acceptance of related advertising models (particularly in the case of mobile advertising), the extent to which web browsers, software programs and/or other applications that limit or prevent advertising from being displayed become commonplace and the extent to which the industry is able to effectively manage the continuing and increasing problem of click fraud.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Any lack of growth in the market for online advertising (particularly for paid listings) and/or any decrease in the effectiveness and value of online advertising (whether due to changes in laws, changes in industry practices, the emergence of technologies that can block the display of advertisements across platforms or other developments) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our success depends, in part, on our continued ability to introduce new and enhanced products and services that resonate with consumers.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	We may not be able to convert traffic to our various platforms into repeat users, nor increase user engagement levels, unless we continue to introduce new and enhanced products and services in response to evolving trends and technologies in the various markets in which we operate, as well as provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with consumers.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Online products and services and related systems, technology and infrastructure, as well as the manner in which consumers access online products and services generally, have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, subject to rapid change and continuing evolution.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We may not be able to adapt quickly enough or at all to online trends generally and/or trends in the various markets and industries in which we operate (including changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally), appropriately time the introduction of new and enhanced products and services and/or identify new business opportunities in a timely manner.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Moreover, the evolving preferences and needs of our users and consumers could require timely and costly updates to our products and services and related systems, technology and infrastructure.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	While the continued introduction of new and/or enhanced products and services is critical to our success, by definition, new products and services have limited operating histories, which could make it difficult for us to evaluate our then current business and future prospects.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	For example, through Match Group, we seek to tailor each of our dating brands and products to meet the preferences of specific user communities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Building a given dating brand or product is generally an iterative process that occurs over a meaningful period of time and involves considerable resources and expenditures.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Although certain of our newer dating brands and products have experienced significant growth over relatively short periods of time, the historical growth rates of these dating brands and products may not be an indication of future growth rates for our newer dating brands and products generally.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We have encountered, and may continue to encounter, risks and difficulties as we build new and/or enhanced products and services.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Lastly, new technologies and policies could interfere with our ability to offer our products and services.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	For example, third parties continue to introduce technologies (including new and enhanced web browsers and operating systems) that may limit or prevent consumers from installing certain types of applications and/or have features and policies that significantly lessen the likelihood that consumers will install our applications or that previously installed applications will remain in active use.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our failure to successfully modify our products and services in a cost-effective manner in response to the introduction and adoption of new technologies, features and policies and/or find alternative sources of revenue to support products and services that currently generate revenue through advertising, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S6	The failure to successfully address any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to our various brands and businesses may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Traffic building and conversion initiatives involve considerable expenditures for online and offline advertising and marketing.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	with these initiatives, which may not be successful or cost-effective.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Historically, we have had to increase advertising and marketing expenditures over time in order to attract and convert consumers, retain users and sustain our growth.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In the case of paid advertising generally, our ability to market our brands on any given property or channel is subject to the policies of the relevant third party seller, publisher of advertising (including search engines and social media platforms) or marketing affiliate.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, a third party could limit our ability to purchase certain types of advertising and/or advertise certain of our products and services, which could affect our ability to compete effectively and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We cannot assure you that third parties will not limit or prohibit one or more of our businesses from using certain current or prospective marketing channels in the future.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If a significant marketing channel were to impose such a limitation or prohibition on one of more of our businesses generally, for a significant period of time and/or on a recurring basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, if we fail to comply with the policies of third party sellers, publishers of advertising and/or marketing affiliates, our advertisements could be removed without notice and/or our accounts could be suspended or terminated, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In the case of our search engine marketing and optimization efforts, our failure to respond successfully to rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may be unilaterally updated by search engines without advance notice), could adversely affect both our paid search engine marketing efforts and free search engine traffic.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Such changes could adversely affect paid listings (both their placement and pricing), as well as the ranking of our brands and businesses within search results, any or all of which could increase our costs (particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic) and adversely affect the effectiveness of our marketing efforts overall.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Certain of our businesses engage in efforts similar to search engine optimization through Facebook and other social media platforms (for example, developing content designed to appear higher in a given Facebook News Feed and generate "likes") that involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Evolving consumer behavior can also affect the availability of cost-effective marketing opportunities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	For example, as traditional television viewership declines and media is increasingly consumed through various digital means, the reach of traditional advertising channels is contracting and the number of digital advertising channels is expanding.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	To continue to reach consumers, engage with users and continue to grow in this environment, we will need to identify and devote more of our overall marketing expenditures to newer digital advertising channels (such as online video and other digital platforms), as well as targeted consumer and user campaigns via these channels.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Generally, the opportunities in (and sophistication of) newer advertising channels are undeveloped and unproven relative to traditional channels, which could make it difficult for us to assess returns on our marketing investment in the case of these channels.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, as we increasingly depend on newer digital means for traffic, these efforts will involve challenges and risks similar to those we face in connection with our search engine marketing efforts.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Lastly, we also enter into various arrangements with third parties in an effort to drive traffic to our various brands and businesses, which arrangements are generally more cost-effective than traditional marketing efforts.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	If we are unable to renew existing (and enter into new) arrangements of this nature, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue would increase over the long-term.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Any failure to attract and acquire new (and retain existing) consumer traffic and users in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P12_S8	Certain of our brands and businesses operate in especially competitive industries and innovation by our competitors in these industries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The dating and home services industries are competitive, with a consistent and growing stream of new products and entrants.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographical areas and/or with consumer demographics that we currently serve or may serve in the future.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, some of our competitors, given the primary business in which they engage, can market their products and services online in a more prominent and cost-effective manner than we can.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Any of these advantages could enable our competitors to offer products and services that are more appealing to consumers than our products and services and/or respond more quickly and/or cost effectively than we do to evolving market opportunities and trends.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	For example, search engine providers continue to expand their product and service offerings into non-search-related categories, including home services.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Search engine providers can and may display their own integrated or related home services products and services in a more prominent manner than our products and services in search results.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	This could result in a substantial decrease in free and paid traffic to the businesses within our ANGI Homeservices segment and, in turn, increased marketing expenditures (particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic).
891103_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In addition, within the dating and home services industries, costs for consumers to switch among products and services are low or non-existent.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	And in the case of service providers, while they would lose amounts paid for Marketplace membership packages and advertising if they switched to a competitor before the expiration of the related term, costs for switching over the long term are low.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Low switching costs, coupled with the propensity of consumers to try new products and services generally, will most likely result in the continued emergence of new products and services, entrants and business models in the dating and home services industries.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Our inability to compete effectively against current or future competitors and new products and services that may emerge could result in decreases in the size and level of engagement of our user and service provider bases, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to build, maintain and/or enhance our various brands.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Through our various businesses, we own and operate a number of widely known consumer brands with strong brand appeal within their respective markets and industries, as well as a number of emerging brands that we are in the process of building.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We believe that our success depends, in large part, on our continued ability to maintain and enhance our established brands, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) our emerging brands.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our brands and brand-building efforts could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product and service quality concerns, consumer complaints, actions brought by consumers, inappropriate and/or criminal actions taken by users and related media coverage, actions taken by governmental or regulatory authorities and data protection and security breaches.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In addition, trust in the integrity and objective, unbiased nature of the ratings and reviews found across our home services brands (particularly Angie s List) contributes significantly to public perception of these brands and their ability to attract consumers and convert them into users.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If consumers perceive that ratings and reviews are not authentic in general, the reputation and the strength of the relevant brand could be materially and adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Moreover, the inability to develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers, adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost effective manner) to evolving changes in the Internet and related technologies, applications and devices and market our products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), could adversely affect our various brands and brand-building efforts, and in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and monetize versions of our products and services for mobile and other digital devices.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	As consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile and other digital devices (including through digital voice assistants), we will need to devote significant time and resources to ensure that our products and services are accessible across these platforms (and multiple platforms generally).
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Despite these efforts, we may not be able to keep pace with evolving online trends generally and/or trends in the various markets and industries in which we operate (including changes in the preferences and needs of our users and consumers generally).
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Even if we do, new and/or enhanced products and services we offer may not resonate with consumers and, in turn, not generate sufficient traffic to our various brands and businesses.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Moreover, we may not be able to monetize products and services for mobile and other digital devices as effectively as we have been able to monetize our traditional products and services.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	In addition, the success of our mobile and digital applications is dependent on their interoperability with various third party operating systems, technology, infrastructure and standards over which we have no control and any changes to any of these things that compromise the quality or functionality of our mobile and digital applications could adversely affect their usage levels, and in turn, our ability to attract consumers and advertisers.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S9	Our failure or inability to successfully respond to the general shift of consumers to mobile and other digital devices could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S10	Lastly, as technology continues to evolve, products and services that we develop for mobile and other digital devices could require us to modify our related systems, technology and infrastructure.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P16_S11	If these modifications are not done in an efficient and cost-effective manner, our products and services for mobile and other digital devices (and related systems, technology and infrastructure) could be rendered obsolete.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The distribution and use of our products and services depends, in part, on third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We distribute our products and services through a variety of third party publishers and distribution channels.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	For example, as consumers increasingly access our products and services through mobile applications, we (primarily in the case of our dating business and Apalon, one of the businesses within our Applications segment) increasingly depend upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	of (and requirement to pay) certain fees associated with purchases facilitated by Apple and Google through our mobile applications, and to interpret their respective terms and conditions in ways that may limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to distribute mobile applications through their stores.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We cannot assure you that Apple or Google will not limit.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	eliminate or otherwise interfere with the distribution of our mobile applications.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If either or both of them did so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The use of certain of our products and services also depends, in part, on third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	For example, many users of Match Group's Tinder and certain other dating products currently register for (and log in to) these dating products exclusively through their Facebook profiles.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	While Match Group recently launched an alternate authentication method that allows users to register for (and log into) Tinder using their mobile phone number, no assurances can be provided that this method will be widely adopted by users.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Facebook has broad discretion to change its terms and conditions applicable to the use of its platform and to interpret its terms and conditions in ways that could limit, eliminate or otherwise interfere with our ability to use Facebook as an authentication method and if Facebook did so and the alternate method described above is not widely adopted by users or becomes unavailable for any reason, Match Group s, and in turn, our, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Lastly, certain of the businesses within our Applications segment have entered into (and expect to continue to enter into) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications to users through third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Most of these agreements are either non-exclusive and short-term in nature or, in the case of long term or exclusive agreements, are terminable by either party in certain specified circumstances.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S10	The inability of these businesses to enter into new (or renew existing) agreements to distribute search boxes, browser extensions and other applications through third parties for any reason would result in decreases in traffic to our various brands and businesses, queries and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S11	General economic events or trends, particularly those that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior, could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P18_S12	We have historically been, and will continue to be, particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact advertising spending levels and consumer confidence and spending behavior.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A significant portion of our consolidated revenue (and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access), is attributable to online advertising, primarily revenue from our Applications and Publishing segments.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Accordingly, we are particularly sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased advertising expenditures.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Advertising expenditures have historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns, as well as levels of consumer confidence and discretionary spending.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Similarly, some of our businesses (primarily those within our ANGI Homeservices segment) are particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions, consumer confidence, spending levels and access to credit could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or foregoing home services projects, which could result in decreases in Marketplace service requests and related fees paid by Marketplace service professionals for consumer matches, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, because a significant number of service professionals across ANGI Homeservices brands are sole proprietorships and small businesses, they may be particularly impacted by events and trends that adversely impact consumer confidence, spending behavior and access to credit.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	If so, they may be less likely to pay for Marketplace membership and/or advertising, which could result in turnover at the Marketplace and/or any of our directories.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Any significant and/or recurring turnover over a prolonged period could adversely impact the number and quality of service professionals in the Marketplace and our directories, as well as the reach of (and breadth of services offered through) the Marketplace and our directories, any or all of which could result in a decrease in traffic to ANGI Homeservices brands and businesses and increased costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In the recent past, adverse economic conditions have caused, and if such conditions were to recur in the future they could cause, decreases and/or delays in advertising expenditures and discretionary spending by consumers and limited access to credit, which would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Communicating with users and consumers via e-mail is critical to our success, and any erosion in our ability to communicate in this fashion that is not sufficiently replaced by other means could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations .
891103_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Historically, one of our primary means of communicating with consumers and keeping our users engaged with our products and services has been via e-mail communication.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	As consumer habits continue to evolve in the era of mobile and other digital devices and messaging and social media apps, usage of e-mail, particularly among younger consumers, has declined and we expect this trend to continue.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In addition, deliverability and other restrictions imposed by third party e-mail providers and/or applicable law could limit or prevent our ability to send e-mails to consumers and users.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	A continued and significant erosion in our ability to communicate successfully with consumers and users via e-mail could have an adverse impact on the user experience, user engagement levels and the rate at which non paying users become paid subscribers.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	While we continually work to find new means of communicating and connecting with consumers and our users (for example, through push notifications), we cannot assure you that such alternative means of communication will be as effective as e-mail has been historically.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Any failure to develop or take advantage of new means of communication and/or limitations on such means imposed by applicable law, mobile and digital device manufacturers or otherwise could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Each of our dating products monetizes users at different rates.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If a meaningful migration of our user base from our higher monetizing dating products to our lower monetizing dating products were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Through Match Group, we own, operate and manage a large and diverse portfolio of dating products.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Each dating product has its own mix of free and paid features designed to optimize the user experience for, and revenue generation from, that product s user community.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In general, the mix of features for the various dating products within our more established brands leads to higher monetization rates per user than the mix of features for the various dating products within our newer brands.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If a significant portion of our user base were to migrate to our less profitable dating brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	As the distribution of our dating products through digital app stores increases, in order to maintain our profit margins, we may need to offset increasing digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures, increasing user volume or monetization per user or by engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected .
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	As users of our dating products continue to shift to mobile and other digital devices, we increasingly rely upon the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store to distribute our mobile applications.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	While our mobile dating applications are generally free to download from these stores, users can purchase subscriptions and certain la carte features through these applications.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We determine the prices at which these subscriptions and features are sold; however, related purchases must be processed through the in-app payment systems provided by Apple and, to a lesser extent, Google.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As a result, we pay Apple and Google, as applicable, a share (generally 30%) of the revenue we receive from these transactions.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	While we are constantly innovating on and creating our own payment systems and methods, given the increasing distribution of our dating products through digital app stores and in-app payment system requirements, we may need to offset these increased digital app store fees by decreasing traditional marketing expenditures as a percentage of revenue, increasing user volume or monetization per user or engaging in other efforts to increase revenue or decrease costs generally, or our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our success depends, in part, of the ability of ANGI Homeservices to establish and maintain relationships with quality service professionals.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	We will need to continue to attract, retain and grow the number of skilled and reliable service professionals who can provide home services that consumers want in a timely manner across ANGI Homeservices platforms.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	To do so, we must continue to offer products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally, as well provide service professionals with an attractive return on their marketing and advertising investments.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	If we fail to provide compelling products and services across ANGI Homeservices brands and businesses, Marketplace service professionals may leave (or fail to join) the Marketplace and certified service professionals may leave (of fail to join) the Angie s List nationwide online directory, one or both of which would result in a less attractive overall digital marketplace for consumers seeking quality service professionals.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Any decrease in quality service professionals (or the lack of new quality service professionals) would result in a smaller and less diverse Marketplace and smaller and less diverse directories, which could adversely impact the consumer experience, and in turn, result in decreases in service requests and directory searches, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We depend upon arrangements with Google and any adverse change in this relationship could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	A meaningful portion of our consolidated revenue (and a substantial portion of our net cash from operations that we can freely access) is attributable to a services agreement with Google.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, we display and syndicate paid listings provided by Google in response to search queries generated by users of our Applications and Publishing properties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In exchange for making our search traffic available to Google, we receive a share of the revenue generated by the paid listings supplied to us, as well as certain other search related services.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our current agreement with Google expires on March 31, 2020 and we may choose to terminate this agreement effective March 31, 2019.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The amount of revenue we receive from Google depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount Google charges for advertisements, the efficiency of Google s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings in response to search queries and parameters established by Google regarding the number and placement of paid listings displayed in response to search queries.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, Google makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to advertisers) of clicks on paid listings from searches performed on our Applications and Publishing properties and these judgments factor into the amount of revenue we receive.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Google also makes judgments about the relative attractiveness (to users) of paid listings from searches and these judgments factor into the amount of advertisements we can purchase.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Changes to the amount Google charges advertisers, the efficiency of Google s paid listings network, Google's judgment about the relative attractiveness to advertisers of clicks on paid listings from our Applications and Publishing properties or to the parameters applicable to the display of paid listings generally could result in a decrease in the amount of revenue we receive from Google and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Such changes could come about for a number of reasons, including general market conditions, competition or policy and operating decisions made by Google.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Our services agreement with Google also requires that we comply with certain guidelines for the use of Google brands and services, including guidelines that govern which products and applications may access Google services, and the manner in which Google s paid listings are displayed within search results across various third party platforms and products (including our Applications and Publishing properties).
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Our services agreement also requires that we establish guidelines to govern certain activities of third parties to whom we syndicate paid listings, including the manner in which these parties drive search traffic to their websites and display paid listings.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of, our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Noncompliance with Google s guidelines by us or the third parties to whom we are permitted to syndicate paid listings or through which we secure distribution arrangements for certain of our Applications properties could, if not cured, result in the suspension of some or all Google services to our properties (or the websites of our third party partners) and/or the termination of the services agreement by Google.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S9	The termination of the services agreement by Google, the curtailment of our rights under the agreement (whether pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise) and/or the failure of Google to perform its obligations under the agreement would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S10	If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to find another suitable alternate paid listings provider (or if an alternate provider were found, the economic and other terms of the agreement and the quality of paid listings may be inferior relative to our arrangements with, and the paid listings supplied by, Google) or otherwise replace the lost revenues.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S12	We operate in certain foreign markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union, and as a result, are exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the Euro and British Pound ("GBP").
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S13	During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 30% and 26%, respectively, of our total revenues were international revenues.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S14	We translate international revenues into U.S. Dollar-denominated results.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S15	As a result, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of the statement of operations of our international businesses into U.S. Dollars affects the period-over-period comparability of operating results.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P27_S16	The average GBP and Euro versus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was approximately 5% higher and 2% lower, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses to the extent we or are subsidiaries conduct transactions in, and/or have assets and/or liabilities that are denominated in, a currency other than the relevant entity's functional currency.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We recorded foreign currency exchange losses of $16.8 million and gains of $34.4 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	our foreign currency exchange losses and gains during these fiscal years.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Foreign currency exchange gains and losses historically have not been material to the Company.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, historically, we have not hedged our foreign currency exposures.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	The continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new markets and jurisdictions increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies, could adversely affect our future results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We may not be able to protect our systems, technology and infrastructure from cyberattacks.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	In addition, we may be adversely impacted by cyberattacks experienced by third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Any disruption of our systems, technology and infrastructure or compromise of our user data or other information due to cyberattacks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are regularly under attack by perpetrators of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software, distributed denial of service attacks, attempts to misappropriate user information (including credit card information) or other malicious activities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Events of this nature could compromise the integrity of our systems, technology and infrastructure, as well as our various products and services, which could in turn adversely affect our users.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The incidence of events of this nature (or any combination thereof) is on the rise worldwide.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	While we continuously develop and maintain systems to detect and prevent events of this nature from impacting our various businesses (and their respective systems, technology, infrastructure, products, services and users), and have invested (and continue to invest) heavily in these efforts and related personnel and training, these efforts are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome preventative security measures become more sophisticated.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Despite our efforts, we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant events of this nature in the future and if such an event does occur, that it will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Any cyberattack or security breach we experience could damage our systems, technology and infrastructure and/or those of our users, prevent us from providing our products and services, compromise the integrity of our products and services, damage our reputation, erode our brands and/or be costly to remedy, as well as subject us to investigations by regulatory authorities, fines and/or litigation that could result in liability to third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Even if we do not experience such events, the impact of any such events experienced by third parties with whom we do business (or upon whom we otherwise rely in connection with our operations) could have a similar effect.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Moreover, even cyberattacks and security breaches that do not impact us directly may result in consumers being less likely to use online products and services generally.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S8	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses resulting from any of these events.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P31_S9	If the security of personal, confidential or sensitive user information, including credit card information, that we maintain and store is breached or otherwise accessed by unauthorized persons, it may be costly to mitigate the impact of such an event, our reputation could be harmed and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We receive, process, store and transmit a significant amount of personal, confidential or sensitive user or other information, including credit card information, and in the case of certain of our products and services, enable users to share their personal information with each other.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In some cases, we retain third party vendors to store this information.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	While we continuously develop and maintain systems to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of this information, we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information despite our efforts.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If any such event were to occur, we may not be able to remedy the event, and we may have to expend significant capital and other resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P32_S4	If a breach of our security (or the security of third party vendors we have retained) occurs, the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and our reputation may be harmed, we could lose users and the recognition of our various brands and businesses and their competitive positions could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches, fraud that we or third parties experience or additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Certain of our businesses accept payment (including recurring payments) from users, primarily through credit card transactions and certain online payment service providers.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The ability of these businesses to access payment information on a real time basis without having to proactively reach out to users to process payments for products and services (including auto-renewal payments or payments for premium features on or with certain of our products or services) is critical to our success.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	When we or a third party experience(s) a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders will often cancel their cards.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party s customer base, the greater the number of accounts impacted and the more likely it is that our users would be impacted by such a breach.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If our users are ever affected by such a breach, we would need to contact affected individuals to obtain new payment information and process any pending transactions.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S3	It is likely that we would not be able to reach all affected individuals, and even if we could, new payment information for some individuals may not be obtained and some pending transactions may not be processed, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Even if our users are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the ability of providers of online products and services to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for us or restrict our ability to process payments without significant effort.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Our ability to access credit card information on a real-time basis without having to proactively reach out to affected individuals could also be adversely impacted by increases in various fees charged by credit card companies and processors (such as transaction, interchange, chargeback and/or other fees), the malfunction of credit card billing systems and software and non-compliance with applicable payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"), a security standard with which companies that collect, store or transmit certain data related to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions are required to comply.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S6	If we fail to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and/or comply with the PCI DSS, we could face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures, significantly higher credit card-related costs and substantial remediation costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P35_S7	The processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and increased costs as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights and compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal information and other user data (including personal credit card data, as well as private content (such as videos and correspondence)) in connection with the processing of search queries, the provision of online products and services, payment transactions and advertising on our various properties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The manner in which we share, store, use, disclose and protect this information is determined by the respective privacy and data security policies of our various businesses.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	These policies are, in turn, subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices, regarding privacy generally and the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	These laws, regulations, standards and practices are changing, inconsistent and conflicting and subject to differing interpretations, and new laws, regulations, standards and practices of this nature are proposed and adopted from time to time.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	For example, in 2016, the European Commission adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform that becomes effective in May 2018.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	The GDPR, which applies to companies that are organized in the European Union (or otherwise provide services to (or monitor) consumers who reside in the European Union), imposes strict standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	In addition, the European Union is considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive to impose stricter rules regarding the use of cookies in connection with the provision of online products and services to consumers who reside in the European Union.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	conflicting data privacy and protection laws and standards to our operations in the United Kingdom and how we handle personal data of consumers who reside in the United Kingdom.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, there are a number of draft privacy laws and regulations under consideration in the U.S. (including in various states) and in various foreign jurisdictions in which we do business.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	While we believe that we comply with applicable privacy policies, laws and regulations, as well as evolving industry standards and practices relating to privacy and data security in all material respects, there is no assurance that we will not be subject to claims that we have violated applicable laws and regulations, standards and practices, that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims or that we will not be subject to significant fines and penalties in the event of non-compliance.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Moreover, any failure or perceived failure by us (or the third parties with whom we have contracted to handle such information) to comply with applicable privacy policies, laws, regulations or privacy related contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to (or use or transmission of) personal information could result in a variety of claims against us, including governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties and adverse publicity.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In the case of such an event, our reputation may be harmed, we could lose current and potential users and the competitive positions of our various brands and businesses could be diminished, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S5	In addition, compliance with the numerous privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which our businesses operate (particularly the GDPR) could be costly, as well as result in delays in the development of new products and services if significant resources are allocated to compliance efforts, particularly as these laws become more comprehensive in scope, more commonplace and continue to evolve.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S6	If these costs and/or product and service delays are significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S7	Lastly, evolving privacy and data protection laws in the various countries in which are businesses operate could prevent us from introducing products and services in jurisdictions in which we wish to do business and/or continuing to offer certain products and services in jurisdictions in which we currently operate.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S8	If markets in new jurisdictions in which we cannot do business are large and/or revenue attributable to products and services we can no longer offer is significant, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S9	Our success depends, in part, on the integrity and quality of our systems, technology and infrastructure and those of third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S10	System interruptions and the lack of integration and redundancy in our and third party information systems may adversely affect our business.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S11	To succeed, our systems, technology and infrastructure must perform well on a consistent basis.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S12	From time to time, we may experience occasional interruptions that make some or all of our systems, technology, infrastructure or user data unavailable or that prevent us from providing products and services; any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S13	Furthermore, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God and other similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, data, cloud-based web hosting, broadband, wireless or other storage or communications systems at any time.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S14	Any event of this nature could cause system interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our products and services to consumers.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S15	While we have backup systems in place for certain aspects of our operations, our systems, technology and infrastructure are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S16	In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S17	Any such interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could negatively impact the consumer experience, tarnish the reputation of our brands and decrease demand for our products and services, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S18	We also continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of our systems, technology and infrastructure to improve the consumer experience, accommodate substantial increases in traffic volume to our various brands, ensure acceptable page load times and keep up with technology and evolving user and consumer preferences.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S19	Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect the user experience across our brands and businesses, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and/or increase our costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S20	We also rely on third party computer systems, data center service providers, cloud-based web hosting service providers and broadband, wireless and other communications systems service providers in connection with the provision of our products and services generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with users.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P37_S21	We have no control over any of these third parties or their operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, technology and infrastructure or those of our third party providers, changes in service levels or any deterioration in performance, could impair our ability to provide our products and services and/or process certain transactions.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If any of these events were to occur, it could damage our reputation and result in the loss of users, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and otherwise be costly to remedy.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Mr. Diller and certain members of his family collectively have sole voting and/or investment power over a significant percentage of the voting power of our stock.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As a result, Mr. Diller and these family members are able to exercise significant influence over the composition of our Board of Directors, matters subject to stockholder approval and our operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	As of the date of this report, Mr. Diller, his spouse, Diane von Furstenberg, and his stepson, Alexander von Furstenberg, collectively beneficially own 5,789,499 shares of IAC Class B common stock by virtue of their respective voting and/or investment power(s) over these securities, 4,530,075 of which are held in trusts for the benefit of Mr. Diller and certain members of his family and the remainder of which are held by Mr. Diller personally.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Shares of IAC Class B common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Diller, his spouse and his stepson collectively represent 100% of IAC s outstanding Class B common stock and, together with shares of IAC common stock held as of the date of this report by Mr. von Furstenberg (58,542), a trust for the benefit of certain members of Mr. Diller's family (136,711) and a family foundation (1,711), represent approximately 43.1% of the total outstanding voting power of IAC (based on the number of shares of IAC common stock outstanding on February 2, 2018).
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	As of the date of this report, Mr. Diller also holds 800,000 vested options and 500,000 unvested options to purchase IAC common stock.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	In addition, pursuant to an amended and restated governance agreement between IAC and Mr. Diller, for so long as Mr. Diller serves as IAC s Chairman and Senior Executive and he beneficially owns (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at least 5,000,000 shares of IAC Class B common stock and/or common stock in which he has a pecuniary interest (including IAC securities beneficially owned by him directly and indirectly through trusts for the benefit of him and certain members of his family), he generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that IAC s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the governance agreement) equals or exceeds four to one over a continuous twelve-month period.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	As a result of IAC securities beneficially owned by Mr. Diller and certain members of his family, Mr. Diller and these family members are, collectively, currently in a position to influence, subject to our organizational documents and Delaware law, the composition of IAC s Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers, business combinations and dispositions of assets, among other corporate transactions.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P39_S7	In addition, this concentration of investment and voting power could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to IAC, which could adversely affect the market price of IAC securities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We depend on our key personnel.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled individuals, with the continued contributions of our senior management being especially critical to our success.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Competition for well-qualified employees across IAC and its various businesses is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	While we have established programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing employees, particularly our senior management, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract new employees or retain the services of our senior management or any other key employees in the future.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Effective succession planning is also important to our future success.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	If we fail to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge to successors and smooth transitions involving senior management across our various businesses, our ability to execute short and long term strategic, financial and operating goals, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Our indebtedness may affect our ability to operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S7	We and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S8	As of December 31, 2017, we had total debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion, including $1.3 billion and $275 million of total debt outstanding at Match Group and ANGI Homeservices, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S9	As of that date, we had borrowing availability of $300 million, and Match Group had borrowing availability of $500 million, under our respective revolving credit facilities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S10	Neither Match Group, ANGI Homeservices nor any of their respective subsidiaries guarantee any indebtedness of IAC or are currently subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P40_S11	Similarly, neither IAC nor any of its subsidiaries (other than Match Group and its subsidiaries in the case of Match Group indebtedness and ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries in the case of ANGI Homeservices indebtedness) guarantee any indebtedness of Match Group or ANGI Homeservices nor are subject to any of the covenants related to such indebtedness.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The terms of the indebtedness of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices could:
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	limit our respective abilities to react to changing market conditions in the various industries in which we do business.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In addition to our respective debt service obligations, the operations of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices require substantial investments on a continuing basis.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The ability of any of us to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance indebtedness obligations and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our respective operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our respective businesses, depends on our respective financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Subject to certain restrictions in the agreements governing certain indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional unsecured and secured indebtedness.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Although the terms of agreements governing certain indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S5	If we and/or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Also, if an event a default has occurred or our leverage ratio exceeds thresholds specified in the agreements governing our indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends or to make distributions and repurchase or redeem our stock would be limited and the agreements governing the indebtedness of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices contain similar restrictions.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S7	We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness that may not be successful.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P42_S8	The ability of IAC, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices to satisfy our respective debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:
891103_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	the future ability of IAC and Match Group to borrow under our respective revolving credit agreements, as well as the future ability of ANGI Homeservices to add one or more incremental term loans or revolving facilities under its credit agreement, the availability of which will depend on, among other things, compliance with the covenants in the agreements governing such indebtedness.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We cannot assure you that we, Match Group of ANGI Homeservices will generate sufficient cash flow from our respective operations, or that we, Match Group or ANGI Homeservices will be able to otherwise take the actions described immediately above, in amounts sufficient to fund our respective liquidity needs.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	See also "-We may not freely access the cash of Match Group, ANGI Homeservices and their respective subsidiaries" below.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, and/or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S6	We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S7	The agreements governing the indebtedness of IAC, Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices may restrict, or market or business conditions may limit, our ability to avail ourselves of some or all of these options.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S8	Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S9	We may not freely access the cash of Match Group, ANGI Homeservices and their respective subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S10	IAC's potential sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of certain of our subsidiaries, availability under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from asset sales, including marketable securities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S11	The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which they may be or become subject.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S12	The agreements governing the indebtedness of Match Group and ANGI Homeservices limit their ability to pay dividends or make distributions, loans or advances to stockholders, including IAC.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S13	In addition, because Match Group and ANGI Homeservices are separate and distinct legal entities with public shareholders, they have no obligation to provide us with funds, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S14	Variable rate indebtedness will subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S15	As of December 31, 2017, Match Group and ANGI Homeservices had $425 million and $275 million, respectively, of indebtedness outstanding under their respective term loans.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S16	Borrowings under both term loans are, and any borrowings under the revolving credit facilities of IAC or Match Group will be, at variable interest rates.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S17	Indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates exposes us to interest rate risk.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S18	Match Group's term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50% and as of December 31, 2017, the rate in effect was 3.85%.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S19	If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense on the Match Group term loan would increase or decrease by $4.3 million.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S20	The ANGI Homeservices term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00% and as of December 31, 2017, the rate in effect was 3.38%.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S21	If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense on the ANGI Homeservices term loan would increase or decrease by $2.8 million.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P45_S22	You may experience dilution with respect to your investment in IAC, and IAC may experience dilution with respect to its investments in Match Group and ANGI Homeservices, as a result of compensatory equity awards.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We have issued various compensatory equity awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock unit awards denominated in shares of our common stock, as well as in equity of our various consolidated subsidiaries, including Match Group and ANGI Homeservices.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The issuance of shares of IAC common stock in settlement of these equity awards could dilute your ownership interest in IAC.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Awards denominated in shares of Match Group or ANGI Homeservices common stock that are settled in shares of those subsidiaries could dilute IAC s ownership interest in Match Group and ANGI Homeservices, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The dilution of our ownership stake(s) in Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices could impact our ability, among other things, to maintain Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices as part of our consolidated tax group for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to effect a tax-free distribution of our Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices stake(s) to our stockholders or to maintain control of Match Group and/or ANGI Homeservices.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	and ANGI Homeservices to the extent Match Group or ANGI Homeservices issues additional shares of their respective capital stock in the future pursuant to investor rights agreements, we do not intend to allow any of the foregoing to occur.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	With respect to awards denominated in shares of our non-publicly traded subsidiaries, we estimate the dilutive impact of those awards based on our estimated fair value of those subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Those estimates may change from time to time, and the fair value determined in connection with vesting and liquidity events could lead to more or less dilution than reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and even if we do so, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions and/or not realize anticipated benefits following acquisitions.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	In addition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations or experience impairment of carrying value.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S5	We have made numerous acquisitions in the past and we continue to seek to identify potential acquisition candidates that will allow us to apply our expertise to expand their capabilities, as well as maximize our existing assets.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S6	As a result, our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S7	We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory pricing or other terms and we expect to continue to experience competition in connection with our acquisition-related efforts.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P47_S8	Even if we identify what we believe to be suitable acquisition candidates and negotiate satisfactory terms, we may experience operational and financial risks in connection with acquisitions, and to the extent that we continue to grow through acquisitions, we will need to:
891103_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	successfully manage acquisition related strain on the management, operations and financial resources of IAC and its businesses and/or acquired businesses.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	We may not be successful in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with historical and future acquisitions, including the Combination.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, the anticipated benefits of one or more acquisitions, including the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities we expect to realize as a result of the Combination, may not be realized.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Also, future acquisitions could result in increased operating losses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and the assumption of contingent liabilities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Lastly, the value of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events and/or trends, which could result in significant impairment charges.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P48_S5	The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We operate in various international markets, some in which we have limited experience.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, we face additional risks in connection with our international operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Also, we may not be able to successfully expand into new, or further into our existing, international markets.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We currently operate in various jurisdictions abroad and may continue to expand our international presence.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	In order for our products and services in these jurisdictions to achieve widespread acceptance, commercial use and acceptance of the Internet (particularly via mobile devices) must continue to grow, which growth may occur at slower rates than those experienced in the United States.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Moreover, we must continue to successfully tailor our products and services to the unique customs and cultures of foreign jurisdictions, which can be difficult and costly and the failure to do so could slow our international growth and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Operating abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks, including among others:
891103_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	trade sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The occurrence of any or all of these events could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our success in international markets will also depend, in part, on our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, joint venture or other partners, and to enter into arrangements with these parties on favorable terms and successfully integrate their businesses and operations with our own.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	A variety of new laws, or new interpretations of existing laws, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, can subject us to claims or other remedies and otherwise harm our business.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Some of these laws, such as income, sales, use, value added and other tax laws and consumer protection laws, are applicable to businesses generally and others are unique to the various types of businesses in which we are engaged.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Laws that do reference the Internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In addition, evolving Internet business practices may attract increased legal and regulatory attention.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P51_S6	For example, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to monitor the use of paid search and online "native" advertising (a form of advertising in which sponsored content is presented in a manner that could be viewed as similar to traditional editorial content) to ensure that it is presented in a manner that is not confusing or deceptive.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Any failure on our part to comply with applicable laws may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In addition, if the laws to which we are currently subject are amended or interpreted adversely to our interests, or if new adverse laws are adopted, our products and services might need to be modified to comply with such laws, which would increase our costs and could result in decreased demand for our products and services to the extent that we pass on such costs to our users.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Specifically, in the case of tax laws, positions that we have taken or will take are subject to interpretation by the relevant taxing authorities.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P52_S3	While we believe that the positions we have taken to date comply with applicable law, there can be no assurances that the relevant taxing authorities will not take a contrary position, and if so, that such positions will not adversely affect us.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P52_S4	Any events of this nature could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Moreover, laws that adversely impact use (or growth in use) of the Internet or that regulate the practices of third parties upon which we rely to provide our online products and services could decrease user demand for our products and services, increase costs or otherwise harm our business.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P52_S6	For example, in December 2017, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") adopted an order reversing its May 2016 Open Internet Order, which codified "network neutrality," the principle that Internet service providers should treat all data traveling through their networks the same, not discriminating or charging differentially by content, website, platform or application.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	If any of these actions were to occur, our costs could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Lastly, the passage or adoption of any new or amended legislation or regulation affecting the ability of our businesses to periodically charge for recurring membership or subscription payments could harm our business.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	For example, the European Union Payment Services directive, which became effective in January 2018 and regulates payment services and payment service providers, could restrict the ability of certain of our businesses to process auto-renewal payments for, as well offer promotional or differentiated pricing tiers to, users who reside in the European Union.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	We may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We rely heavily upon our trademarks and related domain names and logos to market our brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and recognition, as well as upon trade secrets.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S5	We also rely, to a lesser extent, upon patented and patent-pending proprietary technologies with expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2038.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S6	We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our various intellectual property rights.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S7	For example, we have generally registered and continue to apply to register and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register and renew domain names as we deem appropriate.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S9	Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S10	We also generally seek to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if we deem appropriate, based on then current facts and circumstances, and will continue to do so in the future.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S11	No assurances can be given that any patent application we have filed (or will file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection against competitors and similar technologies.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S12	In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents we own.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S13	Despite these measures, our intellectual property rights may still not be protected in a meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise, third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization and/or laws (or interpretations of laws) regarding the enforceability of our existing intellectual property rights can change in an adverse manner.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P53_S14	The occurrence of any of these events could result in the erosion of our brands and limitations on our ability to control marketing on or through the Internet using our various domain names, as well as impede our ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	From time to time, we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Patent litigation tends to be particularly protracted and expensive.
891103_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	All of IAC's leases are at prevailing market rates.
891103_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	IAC believes that the duration of each lease is adequate.
891103_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	IAC believes that its principal properties, whether owned or leased, are currently adequate for the purposes for which they are used and are suitably maintained for these purposes.
891103_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	IAC does not anticipate any future problems renewing or obtaining suitable leases for any of its principal businesses.
891103_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	IAC's approximately 202,500 square foot corporate headquarters in New York, New York houses offices for IAC corporate and various IAC businesses within the following segments: Match Group, Video, Applications and Publishing.
891103_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	Rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require the description of material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the registrant's business) to which the registrant or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of their property is subject and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve claims for damages for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
891103_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the judgment of Company management, none of the pending litigation matters that the Company and its subsidiaries are defending, including the litigation matters described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude.
891103_18_ITEM3_P0_S2	The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether any such matters may be material to our financial position or operations based upon the standard set forth in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S0	Securities Class Action Litigation against Match Group As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, on February 26, 2016, a putative nationwide class action was filed in federal court in Texas against Match Group, five of its officers and directors, and twelve underwriters of Match Group's initial public offering in November 2015.
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S1	See David M. Stein v. Match Group, Inc. et al. , No. 3:16-cv-549 (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas).
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S2	The complaint alleged that Match Group's registration statement and prospectus issued in connection with its initial public offering were materially false and misleading given their failure to state that: (i) Match Group's Non-dating business would miss its revenue projection for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and (ii) ARPPU (as defined in "Item 2-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-General-Key Terms") would decline substantially in the quarter ended December 31, 2015.
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S3	The complaint asserted that these alleged failures to timely disclose material information caused Match Group's stock price to drop after the announcement of its earnings for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S4	The complaint pleaded claims under the Securities Act of 1933 for untrue statements of material fact in, or omissions of material facts from, the registration statement, the prospectus, and related communications in violation of Sections 11 and 12 and, as to the officer/director defendants only, control-person liability under Section 15 for Match Group s alleged violations.
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S5	The complaint sought among other relief class certification and damages in an unspecified amount.
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S6	On March 9, 2016, a virtually identical class action complaint was filed in the same court against the same defendants by a different named plaintiff.
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S7	See Stephany Kam-Wan Chan v. Match Group, Inc. et al. , No. 3:16-cv-668 (U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas).
891103_18_ITEM3_P1_S8	On April 25, 2016, Judge Boyle in the Chan case issued an order granting the parties joint motion to transfer that case to Judge Lindsay, who is presiding over the earlier-filed Stein case.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S0	On April 27, 2016, various current or former Match Group shareholders and their respective law firms filed motions seeking appointment as lead plaintiff(s) and lead or liaison counsel for the putative class.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S1	On April 28, 2016, the Court issued orders: (i) consolidating the Chan case into the Stein case, (ii) approving the parties stipulation to extend the defendants time to respond to the complaint until after the Court has appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel for the putative class and has set a schedule for the plaintiff s filing of a consolidated complaint and the defendants response to that pleading, and (iii) referring the various motions for appointment of lead plaintiff(s) and lead or liaison counsel for the putative class to a United States Magistrate Judge for determination.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S2	On June 9, 2016, the Magistrate Judge issued an order appointing two lead plaintiffs, two law firms as co-lead plaintiffs counsel, and a third law firm as plaintiffs liaison counsel.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S3	In accordance with this order, the consolidated case is now captioned Mary McCloskey et ano.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S4	et al. , No. 3:16-CV-549-L. On July 27, 2016, the parties submitted to the Court a joint status report proposing a schedule for the plaintiffs filing of a consolidated amended complaint and the parties briefing of the defendants contemplated motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S5	On August 17, 2016, the Court issued an order approving the parties proposed schedule.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S6	On September 9, 2016, in accordance with the schedule, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S7	The amended pleading focused solely on allegedly misleading statements or omissions concerning the Match Group s Non-dating business.
891103_18_ITEM3_P2_S8	The defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint on November 8, 2016.
891103_18_ITEM3_P3_S0	December 23, 2016, and the defendants filed replies to the oppositions on February 6, 2017.
891103_18_ITEM3_P3_S1	On September 27, 2017, the court issued an opinion and order: (i) denying, without prejudice to renewal, the defendants motions and (ii) directing the plaintiffs to file a further amended pleading addressing the deficiencies in the amended consolidated complaint that were identified in the defendants motions.
891103_18_ITEM3_P3_S2	On October 30, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint, which among other things, dropped their claim under Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933.
891103_18_ITEM3_P3_S3	Pursuant to an agreed-upon briefing schedule approved by the court, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint on December 15, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motions on January 29, 2018, and the defendants filed replies to the opposition on February 20, 2018.
891103_18_ITEM3_P3_S4	We and Match Group believe that the material allegations and claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to continue to defend vigorously against it.
891103_18_ITEM3_P4_S0	On May 28, 2015, a putative state-wide class action was filed against Tinder in state court in California.
891103_18_ITEM3_P4_S1	See Allan Candelore v. Tinder, Inc. , No. BC583162 (Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles).
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S0	The complaint principally alleged that Tinder violated California s Unruh Civil Rights Act by offering and charging users age 30 and over a higher price than younger users for subscriptions to its premium Tinder Plus service.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S1	The complaint sought certification of a class of California Tinder Plus subscribers age 30 and over and damages in an unspecified amount.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S2	On September 21, 2015, Tinder filed a demurrer seeking dismissal of the complaint.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S3	On October 26, 2015, the court issued an opinion sustaining Tinder s demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend, ruling that the age-based pricing differential for Tinder Plus subscriptions did not violate California law in essence because offering a discount to users under age 30 was neither invidious nor unreasonable in light of that age group s generally more limited financial means.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S4	On December 29, 2015, in accordance with its ruling, the court entered judgment dismissing the action.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S5	On February 1, 2016, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S6	On January 29, 2018, the California Court of Appeal (Second Appellate District, Division Three) issued an opinion reversing the judgment of dismissal, ruling that the lower court had erred in sustaining Tinder s demurrer because the complaint, as pleaded, stated a cognizable claim for violation of the Unruh Act.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S7	Because we believe that the appellate court s reasoning was flawed as a matter of law and runs afoul of binding California precedent, Tinder intends to file a petition with the California Supreme Court seeking interlocutory review of the Court of Appeal s decision.
891103_18_ITEM3_P5_S8	We and Match Group believe that the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and will continue to defend vigorously against it.

891103_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	Because the substantial majority of the outstanding shares of IAC common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, IAC is not able to estimate the total number of beneficial shareholders represented by these record holders.
891103_18_ITEM5_P1_S3	We did not pay any cash or other dividends to holders of our common and Class B common stock in 2016 and 2017 and do not currently expect that any cash or other dividends will be paid to holders of our common and Class B common stock in the near future.

891103_18_ITEM6_P0_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2014, earnings from discontinued operations were due to the release of tax reserves related to the expiration of the statutes of limitations for federal income taxes for the years 2001 through 2009.

891103_18_ITEM7_P98_S1	The Tax Act subjects to U.S. taxation certain previously deferred earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax ) and implements a number of changes that take effect on January 1, 2018, including but not limited to, a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and a new minimum tax on intangible income earned by foreign subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM7_P98_S2	The Company s income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes an expense of $63.8 million related to the Tax Act, of which, $62.7 million relates to the Transition Tax and $1.1 million relates to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate.
891103_18_ITEM7_P98_S3	The Company has sufficient current year net operating losses to offset the taxable income resulting from the Transition Tax and, therefore, will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax.
891103_18_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Transition Tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings is a tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits ("E P") of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM7_P99_S1	To determine the amount of the Transition Tax, the Company must determine, among other factors, the amount of post-1986 E P of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as the amount of non-U.S. income taxes paid on such earnings.
891103_18_ITEM7_P99_S2	The Company was able to make a reasonable estimate of the Transition Tax and has recorded a provisional transition tax expense of $62.7 million.
891103_18_ITEM7_P100_S0	No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act .
891103_18_ITEM7_P100_S1	The Company is continuing to gather additional information to more precisely compute the amount of the Transition Tax and expects to finalize its calculation prior to the filing of its U.S. federal tax return, which is due on October 15, 2018.
891103_18_ITEM7_P100_S2	The additional information includes, but is not limited to, the allocation and sourcing of income and deductions in 2017 for purposes of calculating the utilization of foreign tax credits.
891103_18_ITEM7_P100_S3	In addition, our estimates may also be impacted and adjusted as the law is clarified and additional guidance is issued at the federal and state levels.
891103_18_ITEM7_P101_S0	In 2016, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $64.9 million , which represented an effective income tax rate of 80%.
891103_18_ITEM7_P101_S1	The effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to foreign income taxed at lower rates and the non-taxable gain on the sale of ShoeBuy, partially offset by the non-deductible portion of the goodwill impairment charge at the Publishing segment.
891103_18_ITEM7_P101_S2	In 2015, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $29.5 million , which represented an effective income tax rate of 21%.
891103_18_ITEM7_P101_S3	The effective income tax rate was lower than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to the realization of certain deferred tax assets, foreign income taxed at lower rates, the non-taxable gain on contingent consideration fair value adjustments, and a reduction in tax reserves and related interest due to the expiration of statutes of limitations, partially offset by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge and unbenefited losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM7_P102_S0	Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders percentage share of earnings or losses from the subsidiaries in which the Company holds a majority, but less than 100%, ownership interest and the results of which are included in our consolidated financial statements.
891103_18_ITEM7_P103_S0	Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 primarily represents the publicly-held interest in Match Group's earnings, partially offset by ANGI Homeservices losses.
891103_18_ITEM7_P103_S1	Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in Match Group.
891103_18_ITEM7_P103_S2	Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 primarily represented the proportionate share of the noncontrolling holders' ownership in certain subsidiaries within the Video, ANGI Homeservices and Publishing segments and Match Group.
891103_18_ITEM7_P104_S0	PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING IAC reports Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
891103_18_ITEM7_P104_S1	This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_18_ITEM7_P104_S2	We believe that investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results.
891103_18_ITEM7_P104_S3	This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.
891103_18_ITEM7_P104_S4	IAC endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measure.
891103_18_ITEM7_P104_S5	We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measure, which we discuss below.
891103_18_ITEM7_P105_S0	Definition of Non-GAAP Measure Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_18_ITEM7_P105_S1	We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_18_ITEM7_P105_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_18_ITEM7_P105_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_18_ITEM7_P106_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_18_ITEM7_P107_S0	Non-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From Non-GAAP Measure Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants, including unvested grants assumed in acquisitions (including the Combination), of stock options, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance-based RSUs and market-based awards.
891103_18_ITEM7_P107_S1	These expenses are not paid in cash, and we include the related shares in our fully diluted shares outstanding using the treasury stock method; however, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards are included only to the extent the applicable performance or market condition(s) have been met (assuming the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period).
891103_18_ITEM7_P107_S2	Upon the exercise of stock options and market-based stock options, the awards are gross settled, and the vesting of RSUs, performance-based RSUs and market-based awards RSUs, the awards are settled, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.
891103_18_ITEM7_P108_S0	Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
891103_18_ITEM7_P108_S1	Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses related primarily to acquisitions (including the Combination).
891103_18_ITEM7_P109_S0	At the time of an acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as contractor and service professional relationships, technology, customer lists and user base, content, trade names and membership, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives.
891103_18_ITEM7_P109_S1	Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization.
891103_18_ITEM7_P110_S0	An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value.
891103_18_ITEM7_P110_S1	We believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets or goodwill, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of doing business.
891103_18_ITEM7_P111_S0	Gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements are accounting adjustments to report contingent consideration liabilities at fair value.
891103_18_ITEM7_P111_S1	These adjustments can be highly variable and are excluded from our assessment of performance because they are considered non-operational in nature and, therefore, are not indicative of current or future performance or the ongoing cost of doing business.
891103_18_ITEM7_P112_S0	_________________________________________________________________________ (a) Domestically, cash equivalents primarily consist of AAA rated government money market funds and commercial paper rated A1/P1 or better with maturities less than 91 days from the date of purchase, and treasury discount notes.

891103_18_ITEM7_P112_S2	Approximately $420 million of the Company s international cash can be repatriated without any significant tax consequences as it has been substantially subjected to U.S. income taxes due to the Transition Tax imposed by the Tax Act.
891103_18_ITEM7_P112_S3	If needed for our U.S. operations, the remaining cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, however, under current law, would be subject to foreign, federal and state income taxes of approximately $8 million.
891103_18_ITEM7_P112_S4	We have not provided for any such tax because the Company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our U.S. operations and it is the Company's intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S.

891103_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	In May 2017, the Board of Directors of Match Group authorized Match Group to repurchase up to 6 million shares of its common stock.
891103_18_ITEM7_P133_S2	Match Group has not repurchased any shares related to this repurchase authorization.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Company has granted stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights denominated in the equity of certain non-publicly traded subsidiaries to employees and management of those subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S1	These equity awards vest over a period of years or upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S2	The value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S3	Accordingly, these interests only have value to the extent the relevant business appreciates in value above the initial value utilized to determine the exercise price.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S4	These interests can have significant value in the event of significant appreciation.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S5	The interests are ultimately settled in IAC common stock with fair market value generally determined by negotiation or arbitration.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S6	These equity awards are settled on a net basis, with the award holder entitled to receive a payment in IAC shares equal to the intrinsic value of the award at exercise less an amount equal to the required cash tax withholding payment.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S7	The number of shares ultimately needed to settle these awards may vary significantly as a result of both movements in our stock price and a determination of fair value of the relevant subsidiary that is different than our estimate.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S8	The number of IAC common shares that would be required to settle these interests, other than for Match Group and ANGI Homeservices subsidiaries, at current estimated fair values, including vested and unvested interests, at December 31, 2017 is 0.1 million shares.
891103_18_ITEM7_P134_S9	Withholding taxes, which will be paid by the Company on behalf of the employees upon exercise, would have been $15.2 million at December 31, 2017 , assuming a 50% withholding rate.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	In July 2017, Tinder, Inc. ( Tinder ) was merged into Match Group and as a result, all Tinder denominated equity awards were converted into Match Group tandem stock options ("Tandem Awards").
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	All of the Tandem Awards exercised during 2017 were exercised on a net basis and settled in IAC common shares.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S2	Assuming all vested and unvested Match Group Tandem Awards outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 0.8 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S3	Match Group would have remitted $102.4 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 3.3 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S4	In connection with the Combination, previously issued stock appreciation rights that related to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were converted into stock appreciation rights that are settleable in Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S5	IAC has the right to settle these awards using shares of IAC common stock.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S6	Assuming all vested and unvested stock appreciation rights outstanding on December 31, 2017 were exercised on a net basis on that date and settled using IAC stock, 1.4 million IAC common shares would have been issued in settlement.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S7	ANGI Homeservices would have remitted $171.3 million in cash in withholding taxes (assuming a 50% withholding rate) on behalf of the employees and issued 16.4 million of its common shares to IAC as reimbursement.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S8	As of December 31, 2017, IAC's economic and voting interest in Match Group is 81.2% and 97.6%, respectively, and in ANGI Homeservices is 86.9% and 98.5%, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S9	Certain Match Group and ANGI Homeservices equity awards can be settled either in IAC common shares or the common shares of these subsidiaries at IAC's election.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S10	The Company currently expects to settle a sufficient number of awards in IAC shares to maintain an economic interest in both Match Group and ANGI Homeservices of at least 80%.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S11	The Company will not be required to pay the one-time Transition Tax under the Tax Act because of its net operating loss position.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S12	The Company does not expect to be a full U.S. federal cash income tax payer until 2021, which is in line with previous estimates.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S13	We expect the Tax Act to favorably impact our future liquidity, primarily as a result of a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which will lower our effective tax rate and annual tax liability.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S14	The Company believes its existing cash, cash equivalents and expected positive cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures, debt service, the payment of withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees for net-settled stock-based awards, and investing and other commitments for the foreseeable future.
891103_18_ITEM7_P135_S15	The Company's liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services.

891103_18_ITEM7_P136_S1	The Company may make additional acquisitions and investments and, as a result, the Company may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater financial flexibility.
891103_18_ITEM7_P136_S2	Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.
891103_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	The Company has excluded $37.2 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.

891103_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of IAC's accounting policies contained in " Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " to the consolidated financial statements included in " Item 8 Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data " in regard to significant areas of judgment.
891103_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
891103_18_ITEM7_P144_S1	These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
891103_18_ITEM7_P144_S2	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
891103_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.
891103_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates.
891103_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	Business Combinations and Contingent Consideration Arrangements Acquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy.
891103_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	The Company invested $912.1 million (including the value of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued in connection with the Combination), $36.1 million and $650.7 million in acquisitions in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_18_ITEM7_P148_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	In connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_18_ITEM7_P149_S1	Each of these arrangements are recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics.
891103_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements by using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
891103_18_ITEM7_P150_S2	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
891103_18_ITEM7_P150_S3	The changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying value of $459.1 million and $320.6 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_18_ITEM7_P151_S3	In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
891103_18_ITEM7_P151_S4	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, a qualitative assessment of the Match Group, ANGI Homeservices, Vimeo and Applications reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values.
891103_18_ITEM7_P151_S5	Th e primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units are described below:
891103_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	Match Group's October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $6.3 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 1100% and Match Group's strong operating performance.
891103_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $5.9 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 450% and ANGI Homeservices' strong operating performance.
891103_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	The Company performed valuations of the Vimeo and Applications reporting units during 2017.
891103_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the equity of these businesses.
891103_18_ITEM7_P154_S2	The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of, October 1, 2017.
891103_18_ITEM7_P154_S3	The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2017 carrying value.
891103_18_ITEM7_P154_S4	The Company foregoes a qualitative assessment and tests the goodwill for impairment when it concludes that it is more likely than not that there may be an impairment.
891103_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	quantitatively tested the Daily Burn and Electus reporting units.
891103_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	The Company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired.
891103_18_ITEM7_P155_S2	The Company's Publishing reporting unit has no goodwill.
891103_18_ITEM7_P155_S3	The aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 120% of their carrying values is approximately $450 million.
891103_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	The annual or interim quantitative test of the recovery of goodwill involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units to its carrying value, including goodwill.
891103_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired.
891103_18_ITEM7_P156_S2	If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_18_ITEM7_P156_S3	The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year.
891103_18_ITEM7_P156_S4	The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen.
891103_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_18_ITEM7_P157_S2	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_18_ITEM7_P157_S3	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on the reporting units' current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_18_ITEM7_P157_S4	The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units ranged from 12.5% to 17.5% in 2017 and 10% to 17.5% in 2016.
891103_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies.
891103_18_ITEM7_P158_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.
891103_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
891103_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	While the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1.
891103_18_ITEM7_P160_S2	In 2017, the Company did not quantitatively assess the Angie's List indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired through the Combination given the proximity of the September 29, 2017 transaction date to the October 1, 2017 annual test date.
891103_18_ITEM7_P160_S3	The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty DCF valuation analysis.
891103_18_ITEM7_P160_S4	Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_18_ITEM7_P162_S1	Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_18_ITEM7_P162_S2	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2017 and 2016, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% to 7% in both 2017 and 2016.
891103_18_ITEM7_P162_S3	The 2017 annual assessment did not identify any impairments.
891103_18_ITEM7_P162_S4	While the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company recorded impairment charges equal to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets.
891103_18_ITEM7_P162_S5	The 2015 annual assessment identified impairment charges related to certain intangible assets of the Publishing reporting unit and the goodwill on the ShoeBuy reporting unit of $88.0 million and $14.1 million, respectively .
891103_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	Recoverability and Estimated Useful Lives of Long-Lived Assets We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_18_ITEM7_P163_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	that these lives may be changed.
891103_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	The carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $519.8 million and $341.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
891103_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
891103_18_ITEM7_P165_S3	A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
891103_18_ITEM7_P165_S4	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the balance of deferred tax assets (liabilities), net, is $31.3 million and $(226.3) million , respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	The Company evaluates and accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach.
891103_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	Recognition (step one) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more-likely-than-not to be sustainable upon examination.
891103_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	Measurement (step two) determines the amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
891103_18_ITEM7_P167_S2	De-recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when the Company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more-likely-than-not threshold of being sustained.
891103_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	This measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes.
891103_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has unrecognized tax benefits of $39.7 million and $41.0 million , including interest and penalties, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_18_ITEM7_P170_S1	Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_18_ITEM7_P170_S2	The ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from anticipated results.
891103_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	No income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested cash earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of $101.2 million at December 31, 2017.
891103_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to such cash earnings would be $7.9 million.
891103_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	Stock-Based Compensation The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $264.6 million , $104.8 million and $105.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	Included in stock-based compensation expense in 2017 is $122.1 million related to the modification of previously issued HomeAdvisor vested and unvested equity awards, which were converted into ANGI Homeservices' equity awards, the expense related to previously issued Angie's List equity awards and the acceleration of certain Angie's List equity awards resulting from the termination of employees in connection with the Combination.
891103_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	The Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued (including those modified in connection with the Combination) in 2017, 2016 and 2015 using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and, for those with a market condition, a lattice model.
891103_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	For stock options, including subsidiary denominated equity, the value of the stock option is measured at the grant date at fair value and expensed over the vesting term.
891103_18_ITEM7_P173_S2	The impact on stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, assuming a 1% increase in the risk-free interest rate, a 10% increase in the volatility factor and a one-year increase in the weighted average expected term of the outstanding options would be an increase of $5.3 million, $20.3 million and $8.5 million, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	The Company also issues RSUs and performance-based RSUs.
891103_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	For RSUs, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the underlying IAC common stock and expensed as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term.

891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings.
891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	The Company recognizes unrealized losses on marketable securities in net earnings when the losses are determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S3	Additionally, the Company evaluates each cost and equity method investment for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis, and recognizes an impairment loss if the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary.
891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S4	Future events may result in reconsideration of the nature of losses as other-than-temporary and market and other factors may cause the value of the Company's investments to decline.
891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S5	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S6	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S7	Such impairment evaluations include, but are not limited to: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the current business environment, including competition; going concern considerations such as financial condition, the rate at which the investee utilizes cash and the investee's ability to obtain additional financing to achieve its business plan; the need for changes to the investee's existing business model due to changing business and regulatory environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes; and comparable valuations.
891103_18_ITEM7_P176_S8	During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized other-than-temporary impairments of $12.2 million , $10.7 million and $6.7 million , respectively, related to cost and equity method investments.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and long-term debt, including current maturities.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Company invests its excess cash in certain cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, which may consist of money market funds, commercial paper, treasury discount notes and short-to-medium-term debt securities issued by investment grade corporate issuers.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Based on the Company's total investment in marketable debt securities at December 31, 2017, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of these securities by less than $0.1 million.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of debt securities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	However, since almost all of the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance of $1.6 billion was invested in short-term fixed or variable rate money market instruments, the Company would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S5	At December 31, 2017, the Company's outstanding debt was $2.1 billion of which $1.4 billion bears interest at fixed rates.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S6	If market rates decline, the Company runs the risk that the related required payments on the fixed rate debt will exceed those based on market rates.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S7	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the fixed-rate debt by $72.7 million.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P0_S8	Such potential increase or decrease in fair value is based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level and rate of fixed-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The $425 million Match Group Term Loan and the $275 million ANGI Homeservices Term Loan bear interest at variable rates.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The Match Group Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.50%.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the rate in effect was 3.85% .
891103_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	If LIBOR were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, then the annual interest expense on the Match Group Term Loan would increase or decrease by $4.3 million.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The ANGI Homeservices Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2017, the rate in effect was 3.38% .

891103_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The Company conducts business in certain foreign markets, primarily in various jurisdictions within the European Union, and, as a result, is exposed to foreign exchange risk for both the Euro and British Pound ("GBP").
891103_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, international revenue accounted for 30% , 26% and 26% , respectively, of our consolidated revenue.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The Company's primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	As a result, as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate, the translation of the statement of operations of the Company's international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The average GBP and Euro versus the U.S. dollar exchange rate was approximately 5% higher and 2% lower, respectively, in 2017 compared to 2016.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company is also exposed to foreign currency transaction gains and losses to the extent it or its subsidiaries conduct transactions in and/or have assets and/or liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S4	The Company recorded foreign exchange losses of $16.8 million and gains of $34.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S5	The increase in GBP versus the U.S. dollar during 2017 and the decrease in the GBP versus the U.S. dollar during 2016, following the Brexit vote on June 23, 2016, generated the majority of the Company's foreign currency exchange losses and gains in these years.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S6	The 2017 losses and 2016 gains are primarily related to (i) U.S. dollar denominated cash, the majority of which is from the proceeds received in the PriceRunner sale in March 2016, held by a foreign subsidiary with a GBP functional currency and (ii) a U.S. dollar denominated intercompany loan related to a 2016 acquisition in which the receivable is held by a foreign subsidiary with a GBP functional currency.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P6_S7	Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company moved this U.S. dollar denominated cash to a U.S. dollar functional currency entity, which will reduce the impact of foreign currency volatility on the Company's future results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Foreign currency exchange gains or losses historically have not been material to the Company.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	As a result, historically, the Company has not hedged foreign currency exposures.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The continued growth and expansion of our international operations into new countries increases our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
891103_18_ITEM7A_P7_S3	Significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations, in the case of one currency or collectively with other currencies, could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.

891103_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The substantial majority of the paid listings displayed by our Applications businesses are supplied to us by Google Inc. ("Google") pursuant to our services agreement with Google.
891103_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	Pursuant to this agreement, those of our Applications businesses that provide search services transmit search queries to Google, which in turn transmits a set of relevant and responsive paid listings back to these businesses for display in search results.
891103_18_ITEM8_P38_S3	This ad-serving process occurs independently of, but concurrently with, the generation of algorithmic search results for the same search queries.
891103_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	Google paid listings are displayed separately from algorithmic search results and are identified as sponsored listings on search results pages.
891103_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	Paid listings are priced on a price per click basis and when a user submits a search query through one of our Applications businesses and then clicks on a Google paid listing displayed in response to the query, Google bills the advertiser that purchased the paid listing directly and shares a portion of the fee charged to the advertiser with us.
891103_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	We recognize paid listing revenue from Google when it delivers the user's click.
891103_18_ITEM8_P39_S3	In cases where the user s click is generated due to the efforts of a third party distributor, we recognize the amount due from Google as revenue and record a revenue share or other payment obligation to the third party distributor as traffic acquisition costs.
891103_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	To a significantly lesser extent, Applications' revenue also consists of fees related to subscription downloadable applications, which are recognized over the terms of the applicable subscriptions, primarily one to two years, and fees related to paid mobile downloadable applications and display advertisements, which are recognized at the time of the sale and when the ad is displayed, respectively.

891103_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	ShoeBuy's revenue consisted of merchandise sales, reduced by incentive discounts and sales returns, and was recognized when delivery to the customer had occurred.
891103_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	Delivery was considered to have occurred when the customer took title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, which was on the date of shipment.
891103_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Accruals for returned merchandise were based on historical experience.
891103_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	Shipping and handling fees billed to customers was recorded as revenue.

891103_18_ITEM8_P46_S4	The unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
891103_18_ITEM8_P46_S5	The specific-identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold and the amount of unrealized gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings.
891103_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company employs a methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential other-than-temporary impairments of its investments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is determined to be other-than-temporary.
891103_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.
891103_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings and a new cost basis in the investment is established.
891103_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Certain Risks and Concentrations A meaningful portion of the Company's revenue is derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing.
891103_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Significant changes in this industry or changes in advertising spending behavior or in customer buying behavior could adversely affect our operating results.
891103_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Most of the Company's online advertising revenue is attributable to a services agreement with Google.
891103_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , revenue from Google represents 22% , 26% and 40% respectively, of the Company's consolidated revenue.
891103_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The services agreement became effective on April 1, 2016, following the expiration of the previous services agreement, and expires on March 31, 2020; however, the Company may choose to terminate the agreement effective March 31, 2019.
891103_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	The services agreement requires that the Company comply with certain guidelines promulgated by Google.
891103_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Google may generally unilaterally update its policies and guidelines without advance notice, which could in turn require modifications to, or prohibit and/or render obsolete certain of our products, services and/or business practices, which could be costly to address or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
891103_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , revenue earned from Google was $740.7 million , $824.4 million and $1.3 billion , respectively.
891103_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	This revenue is earned by the businesses comprising the Applications and Publishing segments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , revenue earned from Google represents 83% , 87% and 94% of Applications revenue and 71% , 73% and 83% of Publishing revenue, respectively.
891103_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	Accounts receivable related to revenue earned from Google totaled $72.4 million and $65.8 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
891103_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company's business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on third-party technology providers, exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud.
891103_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.
891103_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with financial institutions and are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.
891103_18_ITEM8_P52_S3	Accounts Receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from customers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue reserves.
891103_18_ITEM8_P52_S4	Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
891103_18_ITEM8_P52_S5	The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation to the Company and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry.
891103_18_ITEM8_P52_S6	The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.
891103_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company also maintains allowances to reserve for potential credits issued to customers or other revenue adjustments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The amounts of these reserves are based, in part, on historical experience.
891103_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including significant improvements, are recorded at cost.
891103_18_ITEM8_P53_S3	Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if shorter.
891103_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company capitalizes certain internal use software costs including external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the software and compensation for personnel directly associated with the development of the software.
891103_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases when the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.
891103_18_ITEM8_P55_S2	The net book value of capitalized internal use software is $46.4 million and $46.9 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
891103_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	The purchase price of each acquisition is attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill.
891103_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	The fair value of these intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management.
891103_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the combination as of the acquisition date.
891103_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	In connection with certain business combinations, the Company has entered into contingent consideration arrangements that are determined to be part of the purchase price.
891103_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Each of these arrangements are initially recorded at its fair value at the time of the acquisition and reflected at current fair value for each subsequent reporting period thereafter until settled.
891103_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	The contingent consideration arrangements are generally based upon earnings performance and/or operating metrics.
891103_18_ITEM8_P57_S3	The Company determines the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements using probability-weighted analyses to determine the amounts of the gross liability, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that appropriately captures the risk associated with the obligation to determine the net amount reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
891103_18_ITEM8_P57_S4	Significant changes in forecasted earnings or operating metrics would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.
891103_18_ITEM8_P57_S5	The changes in the remeasured fair value of the contingent consideration arrangements during each reporting period, including the accretion of the discount, if applicable, are recognized in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_18_ITEM8_P57_S6	See " Note 8 Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments " for a discussion of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company assesses goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.
891103_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	When the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, no further assessment of that reporting unit's goodwill is necessary; otherwise, a quantitative assessment is performed and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined.
891103_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
891103_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, a qualitative assessment of the Match Group, ANGI Homeservices, Vimeo and Applications reporting units' goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in excess of their respective carrying values.
891103_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	The primary fact ors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these reporting units is described below:
891103_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Match Group's October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $6.3 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 1100% and Match Group's strong operating performance.
891103_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	ANGI Homeservices' October 1, 2017 market capitalization of $5.9 billion exceeded its carrying value by more than 450% and ANGI Homeservices' strong operating performance.
891103_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company performed valuations of the Vimeo and Applications reporting units during 2017.
891103_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the equity of these businesses.
891103_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	The valuations were prepared time proximate to, however, not as of October 1, 2017.
891103_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	The fair value of each of these businesses was in excess of its October 1, 2017 carrying value.
891103_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2017, the Company quantitatively tested the Daily Burn and Electus reporting units.
891103_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company's quantitative test indicated that the fair value of each of these reporting units is in excess of its respective carrying value; therefore, the goodwill of these reporting units is not impaired.
891103_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	The Company's Publishing reporting unit has no goodwill.
891103_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	The aggregate goodwill balance for the reporting units for which the most recent estimate of fair value is less than 120% of their carrying values is approximately $450 million .
891103_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	The fair value of the Company's reporting units is determined using both an income approach based on discounted cash flows ("DCF") and a market approach when it tests goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 each year.
891103_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company uses the same approach in determining the fair value of its businesses in connection with its subsidiary denominated stock based compensation plans, which can be a significant factor in the decision to apply the qualitative screen.
891103_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Determining fair value using a DCF analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment with respect to several items, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates.
891103_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on the Company's most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, the Company's estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates.
891103_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units.
891103_18_ITEM8_P65_S3	Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_18_ITEM8_P65_S4	The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the Company's reporting units ranged from 12.5% to 17.5% in 2017 and 10% to 17.5% in 2016.
891103_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer gr oup of companies.
891103_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.
891103_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.
891103_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	While a primary driver in the determination of the fair values of the Company's reporting units is the estimate of future revenue and profitability, the determination of fair value is based, in part, upon the Company's assessment of macroeconomic factors, industry and competitive dynamics and the strategies of its businesses in response to these factors.
891103_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	While the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying values, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as of October 1.
891103_18_ITEM8_P68_S2	In 2017, the Company did not quantitatively assess the Angie's List indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired through the Combination given the proximity of the September 29, 2017 transaction date to the October 1, 2017 annual test date.
891103_18_ITEM8_P68_S3	The Company determines the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using avoided royalty DCF analyses.
891103_18_ITEM8_P68_S4	Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.
891103_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	The discount rates used in the DCF analyses reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
891103_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the Company's trade names and trademarks.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	The discount rates used in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment ranged from 11% to 16% in both 2017 and 2016, and the royalty rates used ranged from 2% and 7% in both 2017 and 2016.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	The 2017 annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets did not identify any impairments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S3	While the 2016 annual assessment did not identify any material impairments, during the second quarter of 2016 the Company recorded impairment charges related to the entire $275.4 million balance of the Publishing reporting unit goodwill and $11.6 million related to certain Publishing indefinite-lived intangible assets.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S4	The goodwill impairment charge at Publishing was driven by the impact from the new Google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the corresponding impact on the then estimate of fair value.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S5	The expected cash flows used in the Publishing DCF analysis were based on the Company's most recent forecast for the second half of 2016 and each of the years in the forecast period, which were updated to include the effects of the Google contract, traffic trends and monetization challenges and the cost savings from our restructuring efforts.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S6	For years beyond the forecast period, the Company's estimated cash flows were based on forecasted growth rates.
891103_18_ITEM8_P71_S7	The discount rate used in the DCF analysis reflected the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the Publishing reporting unit.
891103_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies.
891103_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple was determined which was applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of the Publishing reporting unit.
891103_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	To determine a peer group of companies for Publishing, we considered companies relevant in terms of business model, revenue profile, margin and growth characteristics and brand strength.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge related to certain trade names and trademarks and were due to reduced level of revenue and profits, which, in turn, also led to a reduction in the assumed royalty rates for these assets.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	The royalty rates used to value the trade names that were impaired ranged from 2% to 6% and the discount rate that was used reflected the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the trade names and trademarks.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	The impairment charge is included in "Amortization of intangibles" in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S3	In 2015, the Company identified and recorded impairment charges of $88.0 million related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets at the Publishing segment and $14.1 million at the Other segment related to goodwill at ShoeBuy.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S4	The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at Publishing related to certain trade names of certain Ask Other direct marketing brands, including Ask Media Group.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S5	The impairment charge reflected the impact of Google ecosystem changes that impacted our ability to market, the effect of the reduced revenue share on mobile under the terms of the services agreement with Google, and the shift in focus to higher margin businesses in Publishing's Premium Brands.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S6	The combined impact of these factors reduced the forecasted revenue and profits for these brands and the impairment charge reflected the resultant reduction in fair value.
891103_18_ITEM8_P74_S7	The goodwill impairment charge at ShoeBuy was due to increased investment and the seasonal effect of high inventory levels as of October 1, 2015.
891103_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company's reporting units are consistent with its determination of its operating segments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.
891103_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	See " Note 14 Segment Information " for additional information regarding the Company's method of determining operating and reportable segments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Definite Lives Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets with definite lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
891103_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
891103_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.
891103_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is computed either on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset will be realized.
891103_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
891103_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
891103_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
891103_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
891103_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	The fair values of the Company's Level 2 financial assets are primarily obtained from observable market prices for identical underlying securities that may not be actively traded.

891103_18_ITEM8_P96_S2	Accordingly, to the extent that the fair value of these interests exceeds the value determined by normal noncontrolling interest accounting, the value of such interests is adjusted to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital.
891103_18_ITEM8_P96_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the Company recorded adjustments of $6.3 million , $7.9 million and $23.2 million , respectively, to increase these interests to fair value.

891103_18_ITEM8_P98_S2	ASU No. 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP.
891103_18_ITEM8_P98_S3	The new standard provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
891103_18_ITEM8_P98_S4	This five-step model includes (1) identifying the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied.
891103_18_ITEM8_P98_S5	More specifically, revenue will be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services.
891103_18_ITEM8_P98_S6	ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.

891103_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	The principal remaining work is a confirmation of the calculation of the cumulative effect of ASU No. 2014-09 as of January 1, 2018, which will be completed during the financial close process for the first quarter of 2018.
891103_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	The adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

891103_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Within ANGI Homeservices, the effect of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on HomeAdvisor will be that sales commissions, which represent the incremental direct costs of obtaining a service professional contract, will be capitalized and amortized over the average life of a service professional.
891103_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	These costs were expensed as incurred prior to January 1, 2018.
891103_18_ITEM8_P101_S2	Prior to the Combination, Angie's List capitalized sales commissions and amortized the cost over the term of the applicable advertising contract.
891103_18_ITEM8_P101_S3	Following the Combination, Angie's List accounting policies were conformed to the HomeAdvisor's accounting policies and these costs are expensed as incurred.
891103_18_ITEM8_P101_S4	Following the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, these costs will be capitalized and amortized over the average life of a service professional.
891103_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Within Applications, the primary effect of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 will be to accelerate the recognition of the portion of the revenue of certain desktop applications sold by SlimWare that qualify as functional intellectual property under ASU No. 2014-09.
891103_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	This revenue is currently deferred and recognized over the applicable subscription term.
891103_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments, which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.

891103_18_ITEM8_P107_S3	Accordingly, the Company does not expect the amount or classification of rent expense in its statement of operations to be affected by ASU No. 2016-02.
891103_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	The primary effect of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will be the recognition of a right of use asset and related liability to reflect the Company's rights and obligations under its operating leases.
891103_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	The Company will also be required to provide the additional disclosures stipulated in ASU No. 2016-02.

891103_18_ITEM8_P114_S3	Upon adoption, the calculation of fully diluted shares excludes excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds in applying the treasury stock method; previously such benefits were included in the calculation.
891103_18_ITEM8_P114_S4	This change increased fully diluted shares by approximately 2.4 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2017 .

891103_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.
891103_18_ITEM8_P128_S1	Although management currently believes changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues raised in audits and amounts previously provided will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future.

891103_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	Angie s List is a nationwide marketplace for local services where consumers can research, hire, rate and review the providers of these services.
891103_18_ITEM8_P136_S1	Ratings and reviews assist members in identifying and hiring a provider for their local service needs.
891103_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	Angie s List's services are provided in markets located across the continental United States.
891103_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	The purchase price of $781.4 million was determined based on the sum of (i) the fair value of the 61.3 million shares of Angie's List common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Combination based on the closing stock price of Angie's List common stock on the NASDAQ on September 29, 2017 of $12.46 per share; (ii) the cash consideration of $1.9 million paid to holders of Angie's List common stock who elected to receive $8.50 in cash per share; and (iii) the fair value of vested equity awards (including the pro rata portion of unvested awards attributable to pre-combination services) outstanding under Angie's List stock plans on September 29, 2017.
891103_18_ITEM8_P137_S2	Each stock option to purchase shares of Angie's List common stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Combination was, as of the effective time of the Combination, converted into an option to purchase (i) that number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices equal to the total number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such Angie's List option immediately prior to the effective time of the Combination, (ii) at a per-share exercise price equal to the exercise price per share of Angie's List common stock at which such Angie's List option was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the Combination.
891103_18_ITEM8_P137_S3	Each award of Angie's List restricted stock units that was outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Combination was, as of the effective time of the Combination, converted into an ANGI Homeservices restricted stock unit award with respect to a number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices equal to the total number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such Angie's List restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the effective time of the Combination.
891103_18_ITEM8_P137_S4	The table below summarizes the purchase price:

891103_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	The table below summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of combination:
891103_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	The purchase price was based on the expected financial performance of Angie's List, not on the value of the net identifiable assets at the time of combination.
891103_18_ITEM8_P140_S1	This resulted in a significant portion of the purchase price being attributed to goodwill because Angie's List is complementary and synergistic to the other North America businesses of ANGI Homeservices.
891103_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	The fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired at the date of combination are as follows:
891103_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	Other current assets, current liabilities and other long-term liabilities of Angie's List were reviewed and adjusted to their fair values at the date of combination, as necessary.
891103_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	The fair value of deferred revenue was determined using an income approach that utilized a cost to fulfill analysis.
891103_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	The fair value of the trade name and trademarks was determined using an income approach that utilized the relief from royalty methodology.
891103_18_ITEM8_P143_S2	The fair values of developed technology and user base were determined using a cost approach that utilized the cost to replace methodology.
891103_18_ITEM8_P143_S3	The fair values of the service professionals and memberships were determined using an income approach that utilized the excess earnings methodology.
891103_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	The valuations of deferred revenue and intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require significant judgment and estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows, cost and profit margins related to deferred revenue and the determination of royalty and discount rates.

891103_18_ITEM8_P197_S0	_________________________ (a) Amount includes a tax benefit of $3.8 million .
891103_18_ITEM8_P197_S1	At December 31, 2017 , there was no tax benefit or provision on the accumulated other comprehensive loss.
891103_18_ITEM8_P198_S0	_________________________ (b) Amount is net of a tax provision of $0.2 million .
891103_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	_________________________ (c) Amount is net of a tax provision of $0.1 million .
891103_18_ITEM8_P200_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to IAC shareholders:
891103_18_ITEM8_P201_S0	The amount for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015 reflects the reduction in Match Group's earnings (after its IPO on November 24, 2015) attributable to IAC from the assumed exercise of Match Group dilutive securities under the if-converted method.
891103_18_ITEM8_P201_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the impact on earnings related to Match Group's dilutive securities under the if-converted method is excluded because it would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company's net loss.
891103_18_ITEM8_P201_S2	(b) Dilutive securities for the year ended December 31, 2017 , include the impact from the assumed exercise of ANGI Homeservices dilutive securities under the if-converted method, as it is more dilutive for IAC to settle certain ANGI Homeservices equity awards.
891103_18_ITEM8_P201_S3	The impact on earnings of ANGI Homeservices dilutive securities is not applicable for periods prior to the Combination.
891103_18_ITEM8_P201_S4	(c) If the effect is dilutive, weighted average common shares outstanding include the incremental shares that would be issued upon the assumed exercise of stock options, warrants and subsidiary denominated equity, conversion of the Company's Exchangeable Notes and vesting of restricted stock units ("RSUs").
891103_18_ITEM8_P202_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015 , 6.9 million and 1.2 million potentially dilutive securities, respectively, are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_18_ITEM8_P202_S1	(d) For the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Company had a loss from operations; therefore, approximately 11.3 million potentially dilutive securities were excluded from computing dilutive earnings per share because the impact would have been anti-dilutive.
891103_18_ITEM8_P202_S2	Accordingly, the weighted average basic shares outstanding were used to compute all earnings per share amounts.
891103_18_ITEM8_P203_S0	(e) Market-based awards and performance-based stock units ( PSUs ) are considered contingently issuable shares.
891103_18_ITEM8_P203_S1	Shares issuable upon exercise or vesting of market-based awards and PSUs are included in the denominator for earnings per share if (i) the applicable market or performance condition(s) has been met and (ii) the inclusion of the market-based awards and PSUs is dilutive for the respective reporting periods.
891103_18_ITEM8_P203_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015 , 0.1 million and 0.6 million shares, respectively, underlying market-based awards and PSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the market or performance conditions had not been met.
891103_18_ITEM8_P204_S0	(f) It is the Company's intention to settle the Exchangeable Notes through a combination of cash, equal to the face amount of the notes, and shares; the Exchangeable Notes will only become dilutive once the price of IAC common stock exceeds the approximate $152.18 per share exchange price of the Exchangeable Notes.
891103_18_ITEM8_P204_S1	(g) See " Note 13 Stock-based Compensation " for additional information on equity instruments denominated in the shares of certain subsidiaries.
891103_18_ITEM8_P205_S0	NOTE 13 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IAC currently has two active plans under which awards have been granted.
891103_18_ITEM8_P205_S1	These plans cover stock options to acquire shares of IAC common stock, RSUs, PSUs and restricted stock, as well as provide for the future grant of these and other equity awards.
891103_18_ITEM8_P205_S2	These plans authorize the Company to grant awards to its employees, officers, directors and consultants.
891103_18_ITEM8_P205_S3	At December 31, 2017 , there are 2.5 million shares available for grant under the plans.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	The plans were adopted in 2008 and 2013, have a stated term of ten years , and provide that the exercise price of stock options granted will not be less than the market price of the Company's common stock on the grant date.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S1	The plans do not specify grant dates or vesting schedules of awards as those determinations have been delegated to the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of IAC's Board of Directors (the "Committee").
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S2	Each grant agreement reflects the vesting schedule for that particular grant as determined by the Committee.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S3	Broad-based stock option awards issued to date have generally vested in equal annual installments over a four -year period and RSU awards currently outstanding generally vest in three 33% installments over a three -year period, in each case, from the grant date.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S4	PSU awards currently outstanding cliff-vest after a three -year period from the date of grant.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S5	The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is net of estimated forfeitures, as the expense recorded is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S6	The forfeiture rate is estimated at the grant date based on historical experience and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimated rate.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S7	At December 31, 2017 , there is $423.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S8	The total income tax benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 related to stock-based compensation is $423.0 million , $34.8 million and $36.6 million , respectively.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S9	The increase in total income tax benefit recognized during 2017 is due to the adoption of ASU 2019-06 and the recognition of excess tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation included as a component of the current year provision for income taxes rather than recognized in equity.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S10	The Company will recognize a corporate income tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the stock options exercised in 2017, however, there will be some delay in the timing of the realization of the cash benefit of the income tax deduction because it will be dependent upon the amount and timing of future taxable income and the timing of estimated income tax payments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S11	The income tax benefit to be realized on stock option deductions, including those net settled, for the year ended December 31, 2017, is $411.6 million .
891103_18_ITEM8_P206_S12	The income tax benefit realized on stock option deductions, including those net settled, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are $63.4 million and $69.3 million , respectively.

891103_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between IAC's closing stock price on the last trading day of 2017 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options that would have been exercised had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2017 .
891103_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 is $164.6 million , $17.1 million and $53.0 million , respectively.
891103_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	The following table summarizes the information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2017 :
891103_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	The fair value of stock option awards, with the exception of market-based awards, is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
891103_18_ITEM8_P210_S1	The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term.
891103_18_ITEM8_P210_S2	During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the Company's historical volatility.
891103_18_ITEM8_P210_S3	The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasuries with comparable terms as the awards, in effect at the grant date.
891103_18_ITEM8_P210_S4	Expected term is based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees and the dividend yields are based on IAC's historical dividend payments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	The following are the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model:
891103_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	During 2015, the Company granted market-based stock options to certain employees.
891103_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	These awards only vest if the price of IAC common stock exceeds the relevant price threshold for a twenty -day consecutive period and the service requirement is met.
891103_18_ITEM8_P212_S2	The market-based vesting condition was achieved in 2017.
891103_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	The service requirement provides that these awards vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
891103_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	The grant date fair value of each market-based award was estimated using a lattice model that incorporates a Monte Carlo simulation of IAC's stock price.
891103_18_ITEM8_P213_S2	The inputs used to fair value these awards included a weighted average expected volatility of 27% , risk-free interest rate of 2.3% and a 1.8% dividend yield.
891103_18_ITEM8_P213_S3	The expected term of these awards was derived from the output of the option valuation model.

891103_18_ITEM8_P220_S2	The value of the stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights is tied to the value of the common stock of these subsidiaries.

891103_18_ITEM8_P226_S0	The overall concept that IAC employs in determining its operating segments is to present the financial information in a manner consistent with: how the chief operating decision maker views the businesses; how the businesses are organized as to segment management; and the focus of the businesses with regards to the types of services or products offered or the target market.
891103_18_ITEM8_P226_S1	Operating segments are combined for reporting purposes if they meet certain aggregation criteria, which principally relate to the similarity of their economic characteristics or, in the case of the Other reportable segment, do not meet the quantitative thresholds that require presentation as separate reportable segments.
891103_18_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Other segment consists of the results of PriceRunner, ShoeBuy and The Princeton Review for periods prior to the sales of these businesses, which occurred on March 18, 2016, December 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively.

891103_18_ITEM8_P228_S0	_______________________________________________________________________________ (b) The Company's primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of (i) amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable, and (ii) gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
891103_18_ITEM8_P228_S1	The Company believes this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our performance and that of our competitors.
891103_18_ITEM8_P228_S2	Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated.
891103_18_ITEM8_P228_S3	The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.
891103_18_ITEM8_P229_S0	Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to IAC's statement of operations of certain expenses.
891103_18_ITEM8_P229_S1	(c) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable, property and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.

891103_18_ITEM8_P234_S0	_____________________________________ (f) Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and IAC's headquarters building.
891103_18_ITEM8_P234_S1	(g) Total segment assets differ from total assets on a consolidated basis as a result of unallocated deferred tax assets.

891103_18_ITEM8_P238_S2	Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established.
891103_18_ITEM8_P238_S3	Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.
891103_18_ITEM8_P238_S4	The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss.
