97745_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	He was President, Research Market from November 2006 to July 2008.
97745_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	Prior to Thermo s merger with Fisher, Mr. Pesicka was Vice President and General Manager of Fisher s U.S. research market business from January 2004 to November 2006.
97745_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Mr. Wilver was appointed Senior Vice President in November 2006 and Chief Financial Officer in October 2004.

97745_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	He was Corporate Controller from January 1996 to February 2007.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and other events.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Despite any precaut ions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.14 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, we had the ability to borrow an additional $952 million under our revolving credit facility.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If we are unable to service our debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The covenants in our revolving credit facility include a debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedne ss to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Also, an acceleration of the debt under one of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
97745_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The location and general character of our principal properties by segment as of December 31, 2010, are as follows:
97745_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own approximately 4.0 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in New Jersey, Wisconsin, Virginia, Utah and California within the U.S., and in Germany, England and Switzerland.
97745_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	We lease approximately 3.4 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in Massachusetts, California, Texas, Kansas and Michigan within the U.S., and in China, England, Finland, Germany and Australia, under various leases that expire between 2011 and 2029.
97745_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own approximately 7.1 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and North Carolina within the U.S., and in England Germany, Canada, Denmark and France.
97745_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	We lease approximately 4.2 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland, Tennessee and New Jersey within the U.S. and in Australia, Mexico, Germany and England, under various leases that expire between 2011 and 2021.
97745_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	We own approximately 81,000 square feet of office space in Massachusetts.
97745_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	We also lease approximately 11,000 square feet of office space principally in Massachusetts under various leases that expire in 2013.
97745_11_ITEM2_P4_S0	We believe that all of the facilities that we are currently using are in good condition and are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs.
97745_11_ITEM2_P4_S1	If we are unable to renew any of the leases that are due to expire in 2011 or 2012, we believe that suitable replacement properties are available on commercially reasonable terms.
97745_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
97745_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including individual and consolidated multi-party product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured.
97745_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business, as well as through acquisitions.
97745_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	We believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers.
97745_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	Management, after review and consideration with counsel, considers that any ultimate liability with respe ct to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
97745_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	While liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material, we currently believe, on the basis of our claims history and related factors, that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_11_ITEM3_P0_S6	Actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim, our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable.
97745_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	See Item 1 Business Environmental Matters, for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters.
97745_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including, among others, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agency for International Development.
97745_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	Various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations.
97745_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	Some operations involve and have involved the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws.
97745_11_ITEM3_P2_S3	Consequently, some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the future.
97745_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	A summary of the share repurchase activity for the company s fourth quarter of 2010 follows:
97745_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The caption restructuring and other costs in the notes below includes amounts charged to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, beginning in 2009, charges/credits to selling, general and administrative expense primarily for significant acquisition transaction costs.
97745_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	repurchase of $1.01 billion of the company s common stock.
97745_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	repurchase of $414.6 million of the company s common stock.
97745_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	repurchase of $187.4 million of the company s common stock.
97745_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	repurchase of $898.0 million of the company s common stock.
97745_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	Reflects completion of the merger with Fisher on November 9, 2006.
97745_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment but expects that for 2011, such expenditures for its existing business will approximate $285 to $310 million.
97745_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to the disposition.
97745_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.
97745_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.
97745_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities.

97745_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A 10% appreciation in year-end 2010 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $41 million.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Certain of the company s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2010 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $12 million on the company s net income.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The company s convertible obligations are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	Changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of the company s convertible obligations due to the difference between the current market price and the market price at the date of purchase or issuance of the financial instrument.
97745_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 10% increase in year-end 2010 market equity prices would increase the fair value of the company s convertible obligations by $45 million.
97745_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	This data is submitted as a separate section to this report.
97745_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	See Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.

97745_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
97745_11_ITEM9A_P0_S2	The company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated F ramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

97745_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.:
97745_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.

97745_11_ITEM15_P144_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_11_ITEM15_P144_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_11_ITEM15_P144_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_11_ITEM15_P145_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_11_ITEM15_P146_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_11_ITEM15_P146_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option.
97745_11_ITEM15_P147_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximate s the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_11_ITEM15_P148_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_11_ITEM15_P149_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_11_ITEM15_P150_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P151_S0	The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $14.12, $10.41 and $12.70, respectively.
97745_11_ITEM15_P151_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $48.1 million, $20.7 million and $95.4 million, respectively.
97745_11_ITEM15_P152_S0	The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.
97745_11_ITEM15_P153_S0	A summary of option activity as of December 31, 2010 and changes during the three years then ended is presented below:

97745_11_ITEM15_P156_S1	The awards generally vest in annual installments over three years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions.
97745_11_ITEM15_P156_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_11_ITEM15_P156_S3	The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting.
97745_11_ITEM15_P156_S4	Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive cash dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to receive dividend equivalents.
97745_11_ITEM15_P157_S0	The fair value of service- and p erformance-based restricted share/unit awards is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.

97745_11_ITEM15_P170_S0	The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2017 and 2026.
97745_11_ITEM15_P171_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_11_ITEM15_P171_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_11_ITEM15_P172_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_11_ITEM15_P172_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_11_ITEM15_P172_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_11_ITEM15_P173_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.

97745_11_ITEM15_P179_S1	These plans are excluded from the above table.
97745_11_ITEM15_P180_S0	The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.

97745_11_ITEM15_P183_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2010.
97745_11_ITEM15_P183_S1	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_11_ITEM15_P183_S2	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P184_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2010 would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010 and the 2010 aggregate of service and interest costs, as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P185_S0	The company s overall objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth.
97745_11_ITEM15_P185_S1	The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities.
97745_11_ITEM15_P185_S2	The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 4% of invested assets) of private equity investments.
97745_11_ITEM15_P185_S3	The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 34% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately 5% to real estate-related equities, approximately 29% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 37% to funds investing in fixed income securities.
97745_11_ITEM15_P185_S4	The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.

97745_11_ITEM15_P187_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12).
97745_11_ITEM15_P187_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_11_ITEM15_P188_S0	The fair value of the company s private equity and alternative investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds.
97745_11_ITEM15_P188_S1	The following table represents a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs.
97745_11_ITEM15_P189_S0	The table below presents, as of December 31, 2010, the fair value measurements of investments in certain domestic plan assets that calculate and provide the company with a net asset value per share (or its equivalent).
97745_11_ITEM15_P189_S1	These plan investments are all classified as level 2 or 3 according to the fair value hierarchy:
97745_11_ITEM15_P190_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_11_ITEM15_P190_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_11_ITEM15_P190_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_11_ITEM15_P191_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_11_ITEM15_P191_S1	The investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 50% - 60% for equities and 40% - 50% for fixed income.
97745_11_ITEM15_P191_S2	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_11_ITEM15_P192_S0	The fair values of the company s non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009, by asset category are as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P193_S0	The table below presents the fair value measurements of investments in certain non-U.S. plan assets that calculate and provide the company with a net asset value per share (or its equivalent).

97745_11_ITEM15_P194_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P195_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P196_S0	The income tax provision included in the accompanying statement of income is as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P197_S0	The company receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_11_ITEM15_P197_S1	The provision for income taxes that is currently payable does not reflect $10.9 million and $25.1 million of such benefits of the company that have been allocated to capital in excess of par value in 2010 and 2008, respectively.
97745_11_ITEM15_P198_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_11_ITEM15_P199_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_11_ITEM15_P200_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_11_ITEM15_P200_S1	At December 31, 2010, all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_11_ITEM15_P201_S0	At December 31, 2010, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $165.3 million, $609.9 million and $715.9 million, respectively.
97745_11_ITEM15_P201_S1	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_11_ITEM15_P201_S2	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2011 through 2030.
97745_11_ITEM15_P201_S3	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $242.6 million expire in the years 2011 through 2029, and the remainder do not expire.
97745_11_ITEM15_P201_S4	The company also had $180.6 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2010, which expire in the years 2011 through 2020.
97745_11_ITEM15_P202_S0	A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $3.7 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost.
97745_11_ITEM15_P202_S1	During 2009, the company changed its position regarding the undistributed earnings of its Japan subsidiaries.
97745_11_ITEM15_P202_S2	The earnings of these subsidiaries are no longer considered permanently reinvested.
97745_11_ITEM15_P202_S3	As a result, in 2009 the company provided deferred U.S. income taxes of $ 28.0 million, offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $34.4 million.
97745_11_ITEM15_P203_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the company had $62.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_11_ITEM15_P204_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P205_S0	The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
97745_11_ITEM15_P205_S1	The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $5.3 million for interest.
97745_11_ITEM15_P206_S0	The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
97745_11_ITEM15_P206_S1	In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
97745_11_ITEM15_P206_S2	With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2001.
97745_11_ITEM15_P207_S0	During 2010 and 2009, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, all of which reduced income tax expense.
97745_11_ITEM15_P207_S1	During 2008, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a $3.0 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which reduced goodwill.
97745_11_ITEM15_P208_S0	In 2010, the company settled a Swiss audit of one of its subsidiary s 2006 and 2007 tax years which resulted in a $8.5 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_11_ITEM15_P208_S1	The company also settled the IRS audit of its 2007 tax year and the IRS completed the examination phase of its 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries in 2010 which resulted in a $1.2 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_11_ITEM15_P208_S2	Completion of the audits of the 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries is pending appeals at the IRS.
97745_11_ITEM15_P208_S3	In addition, the company settled various state income tax audits during 2010, which resulted in a $0.8 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_11_ITEM15_P208_S4	The company does not currently expect any significant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S0	In 2009, the company settled the IRS audit of its 2005 tax year which resulted in a $0.9 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S1	In 2008, the company settled IRS audits of the 2004 and 2005 pre-acquisition tax years of Fisher, which resulted in a $7 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and goodwill.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S2	This decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was substantially offset by an accrual for unrecognized tax benefits related to the sale of a non-U.S. subsidiary.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S3	The company is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2001 to 2004 tax years.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S4	Completion of the audit of those years is subject to appeals at the IRS.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S5	The company does not currently expect any signifi cant changes to previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S6	The company is also currently under audit by the IRS for the 2008 tax year.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S7	It is likely that the examination phase of this audit will be completed within 18 months.
97745_11_ITEM15_P209_S8	There were no significant changes to the status of these examinations during 2010.
97745_11_ITEM15_P210_S0	Options to purchase 8.1 million, 10.9 million and 3.6 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive.
97745_11_ITEM15_P211_S0	Since the company must settle the par value of its convertible notes in cash, the company is not required to include any shares underlying the convertible notes in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding until the average stock price per share for the period exceeds the $40.20 conversion price for the 3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024 and only to the extent of the additional shares the company may be required to issue in the event the company s conversion obligation exceeds the principal amount of the notes or debentures converted (Note 9).
97745_11_ITEM15_P211_S1	At such time, only the number of shares that would be issuable (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution) are included, which is based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds th e conversion price.
97745_11_ITEM15_P212_S0	The table below discloses the effect of changes in the company s stock price on the amount of shares to be included in the earnings per share calculation.
97745_11_ITEM15_P212_S1	The securities are convertible only if the common stock price equals or exceeds the trigger price.
97745_11_ITEM15_P212_S2	The table assumes normal conversion for the 3.25% Senior Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2024 in which the principal amount is paid in cash, and the excess up to the conversion value is paid in shares of the company s stock as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P213_S0	The annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows:
97745_11_ITEM15_P214_S0	See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company s long-term obligations.
97745_11_ITEM15_P215_S0	Short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $3.7 million and $1.9 million at year-end 2010 and 2009, respectively, of short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company s subsidiaries.
97745_11_ITEM15_P215_S1	The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 10.63% and 11.42% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
97745_11_ITEM15_P215_S2	In addition to available borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $69.6 million as of December 31, 2010.
97745_11_ITEM15_P215_S3	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_11_ITEM15_P216_S0	In December 2010, the company obtained short-term financing commitments from two investment banking firms to fund $1.5 billion of the purchase price of Dionex.
97745_11_ITEM15_P216_S1	Interest on the short-term debt would have been computed based on one of several Federal Funds or LIBOR-based rates, the most favorable of which was 1.75% at December 31, 2010.
97745_11_ITEM15_P216_S2	However, in February 2011, the company issued $2.2 billion of senior notes (see Note 17), primarily to fund the pending acquisition of Dionex, and terminated the short-term financing commitment.
97745_11_ITEM15_P217_S0	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $1 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit that will expire in August 2012.
97745_11_ITEM15_P217_S1	The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_11_ITEM15_P217_S2	The rate at December 31, 2010, was between 0.44% and 0.65% (depending on duration) under the more favorable of the two rates.
97745_11_ITEM15_P218_S0	The revolving credit facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
97745_11_ITEM15_P218_S1	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_11_ITEM15_P218_S2	The financial covenant requires the compa ny to maintain total leverage below a certain maximum level.
97745_11_ITEM15_P218_S3	The company was in compliance with all covenants between 2008 and 2010.
97745_11_ITEM15_P218_S4	The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes.
97745_11_ITEM15_P218_S5	As of December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings under the revolver and $48.3 million in letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $951.7 million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility.
97745_11_ITEM15_P219_S0	At the November 2006 closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023.
97745_11_ITEM15_P219_S1	Interest on the notes was payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year.
97745_11_ITEM15_P219_S2	The notes were convertible at the option of the holder, at a price of $23.73 per share, if the common stock price exceeded the trigger price of $28.48 for a period of time as defined in the agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.
97745_11_ITEM15_P220_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009, the company made a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all outstanding 2.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2023 at a purchase price per $1,000 principal amount of $2,072.4743.

97745_11_ITEM15_P221_S1	Interest on the notes was payable on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year at an annual rate of 90-day LIBOR minus 1.25%.
97745_11_ITEM15_P221_S2	The notes were convertible at the option of the holder, at a price of $29.55 per share, if the common stock price exceeds the trigger price of $38.41 for a period of time as defined in the agreement, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.
97745_11_ITEM15_P222_S0	During 2010, following issuance of a redemption notice by the company, holders of the company s Floating Rate Convertible Senior Debentures due 2033 exercised conversion rights for the remaining $326 million in par value.
97745_11_ITEM15_P222_S1	The company paid the principal and the premium due upon conversion in cash for a total outlay of $573 million.
97745_11_ITEM15_P223_S0	At the closing date of the merger with Fisher, the company assumed $330.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024.

97745_11_ITEM15_P249_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_11_ITEM15_P249_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.

97745_11_ITEM15_P250_S0	The company has funding commitments totaling $6.2 million at December 31, 2010, related to investments it owns.

97745_11_ITEM15_P251_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_11_ITEM15_P251_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_11_ITEM15_P252_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_11_ITEM15_P252_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_11_ITEM15_P253_S0	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_11_ITEM15_P253_S1	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_11_ITEM15_P253_S2	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_11_ITEM15_P254_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.
97745_11_ITEM15_P255_S0	In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
97745_11_ITEM15_P255_S1	The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.
97745_11_ITEM15_P256_S0	There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, contract, commercial and other issues.
97745_11_ITEM15_P257_S0	In view of the company s financial condition and the accruals established for related matters, management does not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_11_ITEM15_P258_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_11_ITEM15_P258_S1	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_11_ITEM15_P258_S2	The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_11_ITEM15_P259_S0	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_11_ITEM15_P259_S1	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2010, was approximately $214 million to $307 million on an undiscounted basis.
97745_11_ITEM15_P259_S2	The portion of these liabilities assumed in the merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger.
97745_11_ITEM15_P259_S3	The company s reserve for these matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $156 million at December 31, 2010 (or $217 million undiscounted).
97745_11_ITEM15_P259_S4	The reserve includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $99 million a t December 31, 2010 (or $137 million undiscounted).
97745_11_ITEM15_P259_S5	The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger.
97745_11_ITEM15_P259_S6	In addition to the above reserves, as of December 31, 2010, the company had product liability reserves of $8 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.
97745_11_ITEM15_P260_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67%).
97745_11_ITEM15_P260_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $61 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $37 million (net discount $24 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_11_ITEM15_P261_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_11_ITEM15_P262_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_11_ITEM15_P262_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.
97745_11_ITEM15_P263_S0	Management monitors the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S0	The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S2	Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of permit requirements and installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facili ties were not material in any period presented.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S3	The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S4	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S5	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S6	Having assumed environmental liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the estimate of loss to fair (present) value.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S7	This fair value was ascribed by using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest rate for monetary assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability.
97745_11_ITEM15_P264_S8	The remaining discount of $8 million is being accreted by charges to interest expense over the estimated maturity period of 30 years.
97745_11_ITEM15_P265_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the company s total environmental liability was approximately $22 million and $23 million, respectively.
97745_11_ITEM15_P266_S0	Management believes that its reserves for environmental matters are adequate for the remediation costs the company expects to incur.
97745_11_ITEM15_P266_S1	As a result, the company believes that the ultimate liability with respect to environmental remediation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_11_ITEM15_P266_S2	However, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_11_ITEM15_P266_S3	Alth ough these environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party recoveries, the company may be able to bring indemnification claims against third parties for liabilities relating to certain sites.
97745_11_ITEM15_P267_S0	Comprehensive income combines net income and other comprehensive items.
97745_11_ITEM15_P267_S1	Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders equity in the accompanying balance sheet, including currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale investments and hedging instruments; and pension and other postretirement benefit liability adjustments.

97745_11_ITEM15_P270_S0	The unrealized loss on hedging instruments relates to the company s 5% Senior Notes due 2015 (see Note 9) and is being amortized over the term of the debt.
97745_11_ITEM15_P271_S0	The after-tax charge recognized in net income was $0.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008.

97745_12_ITEM1_P105_S3	As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site.
97745_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_12_ITEM1_P106_S1	We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_12_ITEM1_P106_S2	We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_12_ITEM1_P106_S3	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $22 million at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM1_P106_S4	The liability for environmental matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value.
97745_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled.
97745_12_ITEM1_P107_S1	We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur.
97745_12_ITEM1_P107_S2	As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM1_P107_S3	However, we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies.
97745_12_ITEM1_P108_S1	As Thermo Fisher s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
97745_12_ITEM1_P108_S2	In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies.
97745_12_ITEM1_P108_S3	While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
97745_12_ITEM1_P108_S4	To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
97745_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_12_ITEM1_P109_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_12_ITEM1_P109_S2	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_12_ITEM1_P109_S3	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 39,300 employees.
97745_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	Financial information about geographic areas is summarized in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.
97745_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	The company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act.
97745_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.

97745_12_ITEM1_P112_S4	The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov.

97745_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 4.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
97745_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of:
97745_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	For example, recent developments in Europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European customers and reducing our U.S. dollar revenues as translated from the euro.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, the European crisis could result in customers in Europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us, or being unable to pay at all.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain, and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the functional currency ).
97745_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In 2010, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $19 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services, but in 2011, currency translation had a favorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $266 million due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The recently enacted Federal legislation on healthcare reform could have an adverse impact on us.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Some of the potential consequences, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	The new legislation also includes an excise tax, beginning in 2013, on revenue from the sale by manufacturers of certain medical devices, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	If our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $11.99 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P26_S5	These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our largest customer in the laboratory products business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P29_S4	We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability .
97745_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If one of these third-party package-delivery provider experiences a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, if one of these third-party package-delivery providers increase prices, and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies that require us to comply with a wide variety of regulations, including those regarding the manufacture of products, the shipping of our products and environmental matters.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Some of our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern the handling, transportation, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous substances.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Some risk of environmental damage is inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture, sell or distribute.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	This requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including the establishment of reserves to address potential environmental costs, and manage environmental risks.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P39_S4	In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P39_S5	As a result, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data, and other attempts to harm our systems.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $7.03 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, we had the ability to borrow an additional $951 million under our revolving credit facility and an additional $100 million under another revolver that supports our commercial paper program.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Recent disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions and reduced lending activity, may adversely affect the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We cannot be sure that initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will continue to stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to us.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The covenants in our revolving credit facility include a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.5 to 1.0.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
97745_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The location and general character of our principal properties by segment as of December 31, 2011, are as follows:
97745_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own approximately 3.2 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in California, New Jersey, Wisconsin and Utah within the U.S., and in Germany, the U.K., Italy and Belgium.
97745_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	We lease approximately 2.2 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in Massachusetts, Texas, Utah and Colorado within the U.S., and in China, the U.K., Australia and Germany, under various leases that expire between 2012 and 2029.
97745_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own approximately 2.1 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in Virginia, Texas, Kansas and New Hampshire within the U.S., and in Sweden, Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland.
97745_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	We lease approximately 1.7 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in California, Michigan, Kansas and Wisconsin within the U.S., and in Finland, Germany, China, the U.K. and France under various leases that expire between 2012 and 2023.
97745_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	We own approximately 7.3 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and North Carolina within the U.S., and in the U.K., Mexico, Germany, Canada, Denmark and France.
97745_12_ITEM2_P3_S1	We lease approximately 4.0 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Maryland and North Carolina within the U.S. and in Australia, the U.K., Mexico and Germany, under various leases that expire between 2012 and 2030.
97745_12_ITEM2_P4_S0	We own approximately 81,000 square feet of office space in Massachusetts.
97745_12_ITEM2_P4_S1	We also lease approximately 11,000 square feet of office space principally in Massachusetts under various leases that expire in 2013.
97745_12_ITEM2_P5_S0	We believe that all of the facilities that we are currently using are in good condition and are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs.
97745_12_ITEM2_P5_S1	If we are unable to renew any of the leases that are due to expire in 2012 or 2013, we believe that suitable replacement properties are available on commercially reasonable terms.
97745_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
97745_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including individual and consolidated multi-party product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured.
97745_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business, as well as through acquisitions.
97745_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	We believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers.
97745_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	Management, after review and consideration with counsel, considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM3_P0_S5	While liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material, we currently believe, on the basis of our claims history and related factors, that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM3_P0_S6	Actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim, our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable.
97745_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	See Item 1 Business Environmental Matters, for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters.
97745_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including, among others, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agency for International Development.
97745_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations.
97745_12_ITEM3_P2_S2	Some operations involve and have involved the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws.
97745_12_ITEM3_P2_S3	Consequently, some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the future.
97745_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TMO.
97745_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of the company s common stock for 2011 and 2010, as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system.
97745_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing price of the company s common stock on December 31, 2011 and 2010, was $44.97 and $55.36, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 4, 2012, the company had 6,050 holders of record of its common stock.
97745_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	This does not include holdings in street or nominee names.
97745_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	While we will continue to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business, on February 29, 2012 we announced that the Board of Directors decided to initiate a quarterly cash dividend.
97745_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	The first cash dividend of $0.13 per outstanding share of our common stock will be paid on April 16, 2012 to all stockholders of record on March 15, 2012.
97745_12_ITEM5_P3_S2	While it is our intention to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, any decision to pay future cash dividends will be made by our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, financial condition and other factors.
97745_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	A summary of the share repurchase activity for the company s fourth quarter of 2011 follows:
97745_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the fourth quarter of 2011 were purchased under these programs.
97745_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The caption restructuring and other costs in the notes below includes amounts charged to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, beginning in 2009, charges/credits to selling, general and administrative expense primarily for significant acquisition transaction costs.
97745_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	repurchase of $1.34 billion of the company s common stock.
97745_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	Also reflects the acquisitions of Dionex Corporation, in May 2011,and the Phadia group, in August 2011.
97745_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	repurchase of $1.01 billion of the company s common stock.
97745_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	repurchase of $414.6 million of the company s common stock.
97745_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	repurchase of $187.4 million of the company s common stock.
97745_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	repurchase of $898.0 million of the company s common stock.
97745_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.
97745_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide.
97745_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the company s continuing operations fall into three business segments (see Note 3): Analytical Technologies, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.
97745_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	Prior period segment results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The results of two businesses sold on April 4, 2011, have been classified and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
97745_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	The results discussed below refer to the company s continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Sales in 2011 were $11.73 billion, an increase of $1.16 billion from 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, to a lesser extent, higher sales at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $787 million (7%) over pro forma 2010 revenues.
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and other acquisitions, net of divestitures, pro forma revenues increased $389 million (3%) over pro forma 2010 revenues (discussed in total and by segment below).
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	The increase in pro forma revenues was primarily due to increased demand, offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, and lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan as compared to 2010, which together decreased sales by approximately one percentage point.
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	The company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe.
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S6	These markets represent approximately a quarter of the company s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately one percentage point, although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter.
97745_12_ITEM7_P3_S7	The company currently expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue into 2012.
97745_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2011 and 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The company s principal recent acquisitions are described below.
97745_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Phadia, a global leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of complete blood-test systems to support the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of allergy and autoimmune diseases, was acquired in August 2011 to expand the company s specialty diagnostics offerings.
97745_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Dionex, a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of ion and liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis, was acquired in May 2011 to expand the company s chromatography systems portfolio.
97745_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Fermentas, a manufacturer and global distributor of enzymes, reagents and kits for molecular and cellular biology research, was acquired in July 2010 to expand the company s ability to provide complete workflows for genomics research.
97745_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Finnzymes, a provider of integrated tools for molecular biology analysis, including reagents, instruments, consumables and kits, was acquired in March 2010 to expand the company s portfolio of reagents and other consumables for the molecular biology research and diagnostics markets.
97745_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Ahura Scientific, a provider of handheld spectroscopy instruments that are used worldwide in the identification of chemicals for safety, security and pharmaceutical applications, was acquired in February 2010 to expand the company s portfolio of portable analytical devices.
97745_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	In 2011, operating income and operating income margin were $1.25 billion and 10.6%, respectively, compared with $1.21 billion and 11.4%, respectively, in 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to $124 million of higher acquisition-related charges and an increase in amortization expense of $93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex.
97745_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities.
97745_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 9.5% and 9.8% in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17 million or 1.6 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates.
97745_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2012 will be between 11.5% to 13.5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.
97745_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Income from continuing operations increased to $1.02 billion in 2011, from $997 million in 2010, primarily due to increased operating income, offset in part by higher other expense, net, primarily interest expense as a result of borrowings to partially fund acquisitions.
97745_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	On April 4, 2011, the company sold, in separate transactions, its Athena Diagnostics business (Athena) for $740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business (Lancaster) for $180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of $20 million, due in October 2012.
97745_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	The sale of these businesses resulted in an after-tax gain in discontinued operations of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share.
97745_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	During 2011, the company s cash flow from operations totaled $1.69 billion (including $13 million from discontinued operations), compared with $1.50 billion (including $45 million from discontinued operations) for 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase resulted primarily from higher income before amortization and depreciation, offset in part by growth in working capital items in 2011 compared to 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the company s short-term debt totaled $1.27 billion, principally commercial paper obligations and $354 million of senior notes, due December 2012.
97745_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Under its principal unsecured revolving credit agreement, expiring in August 2012, the company has available capacity of $951 million at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	In addition, the company has a $1 billion short-term revolving credit agreement expiring in June 2012, the purpose of which is to provide short-term funds in the event access to commercial paper markets is not available.
97745_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	The company expects to renew these facilities before their expiration, for all or a portion of the available borrowings thereunder.
97745_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	At December 31, 2011, the company had $900 million of commercial paper indebtedness outstanding and accordingly, the company had $100 million of borrowing capacity under its commercial paper program revolver.
97745_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.02 billion as of December 31, 2011, and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under both its principal and commercial paper revolving credit agreements and the expected renewals thereof, are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	The company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
97745_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
97745_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
97745_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources.
97745_12_ITEM7_P17_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
97745_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
97745_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due.
97745_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Such allowances totaled $67 million at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	If the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
97745_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
97745_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
97745_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized.
97745_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.
97745_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $6.47 billion at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
97745_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
97745_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
97745_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $11.99 billion and $1.33 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors.
97745_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	The company s businesses were adversely affected in 2009 by the global economic downturn, although results progressively improved during the year and in 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Growth at some of the company s businesses also slowed in 2011 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets.
97745_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Projections of profitability for 2012 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2011, the date of the company s impairment testing.
97745_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2012 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired.
97745_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	Should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
97745_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Other long-lived assets totaled $2.21 billion at December 31, 2011, including $1.66 billion of fixed assets.
97745_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset.
97745_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment.
97745_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary.
97745_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes.
97745_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale.
97745_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company s revenue recognition would be affected.
97745_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
97745_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
97745_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements.
97745_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements.
97745_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed.
97745_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
97745_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately.
97745_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.
97745_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers.
97745_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
97745_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns.
97745_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	The liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled $42 million at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary.
97745_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions.
97745_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.
97745_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
97745_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
97745_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	The company s reserve for these matters totaled $120 million at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P37_S5	Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized.
97745_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
97745_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits.
97745_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income.
97745_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance.
97745_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision.
97745_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	The company s tax valuation allowance totaled $142 million at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P40_S4	Should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
97745_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
97745_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes.
97745_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company s tax provision would result.
97745_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
97745_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	The accruals are based on management s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates.
97745_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Reserves of acquired businesses, including environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value.
97745_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
97745_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	Several of the company s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease.
97745_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels.
97745_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date.
97745_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $17 million in 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $346 million at year-end 2011 compared with $244 million at year-end 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $79 million.
97745_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The company expects to contribute between $20 and $30 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2012.
97745_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option.
97745_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures.
97745_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	Sales in 2011 were $11.73 billion, an increase of $1.16 billion from 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $787 million (7%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including $132 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, $266 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $389 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S3	The increase in pro forma revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, and lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan as compared to 2010, which together decreased sales by approximately 1 percentage point.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S4	Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S5	The results in North America and Asia were affected by the cessation of the supply contract and the lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S6	The company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S7	These markets represent approximately a quarter of the company s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately one percentage point, although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter.
97745_12_ITEM7_P52_S8	The company currently expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue into 2012.
97745_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	In 2011, operating income and operating income margin were $1.25 billion and 10.6%, respectively, compared with $1.21 billion and 11.4%, respectively, in 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	The decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to $124 million of higher acquisition-related charges and an increase in amortization expense of $93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex.
97745_12_ITEM7_P53_S2	The decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P53_S3	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities.
97745_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $235 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for cash transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex.
97745_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	The company incurred $85 million of other cash costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition.
97745_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the following: the consolidation of facilities of acquired businesses in Finland and Australia with existing facilities in those countries; the consolidation of facilities in the U.S. and Mexico; and the restructuring of the commercial organization of a business across six European countries to increase productivity and efficiency in serving customers.
97745_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash costs, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a business (see Note 14).
97745_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $79 million, including $16 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers.
97745_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	The company incurred $34 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated.
97745_12_ITEM7_P55_S2	The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units.
97745_12_ITEM7_P55_S3	The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business unit s acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset writedowns associated with abandoned facilities held for sale.
97745_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	As of February 29, 2012, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $60 million in 2012 and expects to identify additional actions during 2012.
97745_12_ITEM7_P56_S1	The restructuring projects for which actions commenced in 2011 will result in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2011 and, to a greater extent, in 2012, including $30 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $15 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $40 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_12_ITEM7_P56_S2	The additional actions approved in 2011 and commencing in 2012 will result in $30 million of additional annual savings following their completion.
97745_12_ITEM7_P56_S3	The restructuring actions initiated in 2010 resulted in annual cost savings beginning primarily in 2011 of approximately $50 million, including $5 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	On February 3, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations that provide guidance on the excise tax imposed on the sale of medical devices under Internal Revenue Code Section 4191.
97745_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The tax applies to the sale of certain medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of the device.
97745_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	The tax is in the amount of 2.3% of the sale price and will apply to all devices that are sold beginning January 1, 2013.
97745_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	Based on the company s estimate of product revenue that is expected to be subject to the regulations, the company currently expects that imposition of the tax will cost $20-30 million annually, beginning in 2013.
97745_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income.
97745_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3).
97745_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.
97745_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 16% to $2.13 billion in 2011 due primarily to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, existing businesses as well as from productivity improvements.
97745_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $607 million to $3.85 billion in 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Dionex, higher revenue at existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, the favorable effects of currency translation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	Had Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $349 million (10%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including increases of $47 million due to other acquisitions, $95 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $207 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P60_S3	The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand.
97745_12_ITEM7_P60_S4	Demand was particularly strong for instruments serving industrial and applied markets.
97745_12_ITEM7_P60_S5	The increase in revenues was offset in part by lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan in the first quarter of 2011 which decreased pro forma growth by 1 percentage point.
97745_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	Operating income margin was 18.7% in 2011 and 17.0% in 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, accretive acquisitions, price increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	These increases were offset in part by higher spending on research and development initiatives.
97745_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $317 million to $2.47 billion in 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, higher revenue at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation.
97745_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $206 million (8%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including increases of $19 million due to other acquisitions, $68 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $120 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand.
97745_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	Demand was particularly strong for immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics products.
97745_12_ITEM7_P62_S5	The increase in demand was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, which decreased pro forma growth by 2 percentage points.
97745_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	In November 2009, a significant supplier of the company s healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid-2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P63_S1	The company believes this was in part a response to the company s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions.
97745_12_ITEM7_P63_S2	The company signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and is selling these and other products from the new supplier, offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue.
97745_12_ITEM7_P63_S3	As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $54 million, net, in the first half of 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Operating income margin was 24.2% in 2011 and 22.7% in 2010.
97745_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales at existing businesses and accretive acquisitions.
97745_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $285 million to $5.94 billion in 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $107 million in 2011.
97745_12_ITEM7_P65_S2	Sales increased $66 million due to acquisitions.
97745_12_ITEM7_P65_S3	In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $112 million (2%) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_12_ITEM7_P65_S4	Demand for biopharma outsourcing services was particularly strong.
97745_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Operating income margin decreased to 13.7% in 2011 from 14.2% in 2010, primarily due to inflationary pressures on costs, particularly oil-based raw materials such as plastic resin, and, to a lesser extent, commercial investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe.

97745_12_ITEM15_P111_S0	The company uses short-term forward and option currency-exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations.
97745_12_ITEM15_P111_S1	These contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Chinese yuan, Australian dollars and Japanese yen.
97745_12_ITEM15_P111_S2	The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.
97745_12_ITEM15_P111_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the company had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts that were hedging anticipated purchases or sales.
97745_12_ITEM15_P112_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
97745_12_ITEM15_P112_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the company had no outstanding derivative contracts that were accounted for as cash flow hedges.
97745_12_ITEM15_P113_S0	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.
97745_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	During 2009, 2010 and 2011, in connection with new debt issuances, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements.
97745_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	The company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest expense) as the offsetting loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.
97745_12_ITEM15_P114_S2	All of the company s interest rate swap arrangements were terminated in 2011 (Note 9).
97745_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
97745_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets, and in determining the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14).
97745_12_ITEM15_P115_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
97745_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures on offsetting amounts within the balance sheet, including disclosing gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset or subject to a master netting or similar agreement.

97745_12_ITEM15_P117_S2	The new guidance was effective in 2011.
97745_12_ITEM15_P117_S3	Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position.
97745_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	In September 2011, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment.
97745_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	The revised guidance permits an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
97745_12_ITEM15_P118_S2	If impairment is deemed more likely than not, management would perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test.
97745_12_ITEM15_P118_S3	Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
97745_12_ITEM15_P118_S4	This guidance will be effective for the company on January 1, 2012.
97745_12_ITEM15_P118_S5	Adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position.

97745_12_ITEM15_P120_S0	The standard is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect the company s equity.
97745_12_ITEM15_P120_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements.
97745_12_ITEM15_P120_S2	The new guidance will be effective for the company on January 1, 2012 and will not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position.
97745_12_ITEM15_P121_S0	In May 2011, the FASB amended existing rules covering fair value measurement and disclosure to clarify guidance and minimize differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
97745_12_ITEM15_P121_S1	The new guidance requires entities to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements and provide a narrative description of the sensitivity of Level 3 measurements to changes in unobservable inputs.

97745_12_ITEM15_P161_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_12_ITEM15_P161_S1	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.
97745_12_ITEM15_P162_S0	(b) The company does not allocate other expense, net to its segments.

97745_12_ITEM15_P169_S0	The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others.
97745_12_ITEM15_P169_S1	These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company s Board of Directors or for certain non-officer grants, by the company s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer.
97745_12_ITEM15_P169_S2	Options granted under these plans generally vest over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.

97745_12_ITEM15_P169_S4	The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises.
97745_12_ITEM15_P170_S0	Grants of stock options and restricted stock on or after November 9, 2006, provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option holder s employment, all options and service-based restricted stock awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
97745_12_ITEM15_P171_S0	Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the retirement date for retirement eligible employees, if earlier.
97745_12_ITEM15_P172_S0	The components of pre-tax stock-based compensation expense are as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P173_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is included in the accompanying statement of income as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P174_S0	The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company.
97745_12_ITEM15_P175_S0	The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates.
97745_12_ITEM15_P175_S1	The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes.
97745_12_ITEM15_P175_S2	Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $14.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively, in 2011 and 2010.
97745_12_ITEM15_P175_S3	A tax charge of $1.6 million was recorded in capital in excess of par value in 2009 for the excess of deferred tax asset over actual tax benefits realized at option exercise.
97745_12_ITEM15_P176_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_12_ITEM15_P176_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_12_ITEM15_P176_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_12_ITEM15_P177_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_12_ITEM15_P178_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_12_ITEM15_P178_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option.
97745_12_ITEM15_P178_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_12_ITEM15_P179_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_12_ITEM15_P180_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_12_ITEM15_P181_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P182_S0	The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $15.79, $14.12 and $10.41, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM15_P182_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $85.3 million, $48.1 million and $20.7 million, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM15_P183_S0	The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.

97745_12_ITEM15_P187_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_12_ITEM15_P187_S3	The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting.
97745_12_ITEM15_P187_S4	Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive cash dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to receive dividend equivalents.
97745_12_ITEM15_P188_S0	The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted share/unit awards is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.
97745_12_ITEM15_P188_S1	For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

97745_12_ITEM15_P193_S3	Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company.
97745_12_ITEM15_P193_S4	In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the company charged to expense $80.7 million, $59.2 million and $60.8 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.
97745_12_ITEM15_P194_S0	Employees of a number of the company s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries.
97745_12_ITEM15_P194_S1	Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws.
97745_12_ITEM15_P194_S2	The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate.
97745_12_ITEM15_P194_S3	The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.
97745_12_ITEM15_P195_S0	The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability.
97745_12_ITEM15_P195_S1	This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.
97745_12_ITEM15_P195_S2	The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial (gains) losses and prior service costs (credits) that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_12_ITEM15_P195_S3	Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_12_ITEM15_P196_S0	When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset.
97745_12_ITEM15_P196_S1	The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost.
97745_12_ITEM15_P197_S0	The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.

97745_12_ITEM15_P201_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the company s SERP and other postretirement benefit plans:
97745_12_ITEM15_P202_S0	The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2017 and 2027.
97745_12_ITEM15_P203_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_12_ITEM15_P203_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_12_ITEM15_P204_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_12_ITEM15_P204_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_12_ITEM15_P204_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_12_ITEM15_P205_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.

97745_12_ITEM15_P215_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM15_P215_S1	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_12_ITEM15_P215_S2	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P216_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2011 would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2011 and the 2011 aggregate of service and interest costs, as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P217_S0	The company s overall objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth.

97745_12_ITEM15_P219_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12).
97745_12_ITEM15_P219_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_12_ITEM15_P220_S0	The fair value of the company s private equity and alternative investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds.
97745_12_ITEM15_P220_S1	The following table represents a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs.
97745_12_ITEM15_P221_S0	The table below presents, as of December 31, 2011, the fair value measurements of investments in certain domestic plan assets that calculate and provide the company with a net asset value per share (or its equivalent).
97745_12_ITEM15_P221_S1	These plan investments are all classified as level 2 or 3 according to the fair value hierarchy:
97745_12_ITEM15_P222_S0	The domestic plan receives distributions from the private equity funds as those funds' assets are liquidated.
97745_12_ITEM15_P222_S1	The duration of the funds vary by investment with the longest ending in 2015.
97745_12_ITEM15_P223_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_12_ITEM15_P223_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_12_ITEM15_P223_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_12_ITEM15_P224_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_12_ITEM15_P224_S1	The investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 50% - 60% for equities and 40% - 50% for fixed income.
97745_12_ITEM15_P224_S2	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_12_ITEM15_P225_S0	The fair values of the company s non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2011 and 2010, by asset category are as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P226_S0	The table below presents the fair value measurements of investments in certain non-U.S. plan assets that calculate and provide the company with a net asset value per share (or its equivalent).
97745_12_ITEM15_P226_S1	These plan investments are all classified as level 2 according to the fair value hierarchy:
97745_12_ITEM15_P227_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P228_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P229_S0	The income tax provision included in the accompanying statement of income is as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P230_S0	The company receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_12_ITEM15_P230_S1	The provision for income taxes that is currently payable does not reflect $14.6 million and $10.9 million of such benefits of the company that have been allocated to capital in excess of par value in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM15_P231_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_12_ITEM15_P232_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_12_ITEM15_P233_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_12_ITEM15_P233_S1	At December 31, 2011, all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_12_ITEM15_P234_S0	At December 31, 2011, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $154.9 million, $613.5 million and $1.03 billion, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM15_P235_S0	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_12_ITEM15_P235_S1	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2012 through 2031.
97745_12_ITEM15_P235_S2	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $207.8 million expire in the years 2012 through 2030, and the remainder do not expire.
97745_12_ITEM15_P235_S3	The company also had $138.6 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2011, which expire in the years 2012 through 2021.
97745_12_ITEM15_P236_S0	A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $4.68 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost.
97745_12_ITEM15_P236_S1	During 2009, the company changed its position regarding the undistributed earnings of a Japan subsidiary and a portion of the earnings of the subsidiary are no longer considered permanently reinvested.
97745_12_ITEM15_P236_S2	During 2010, the company repatriated part of those earnings and as a result, the company provided deferred U.S. income taxes of $14.0 million, offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $15.6 million, on the remaining undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested overseas.
97745_12_ITEM15_P237_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the company had $120.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_12_ITEM15_P238_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_12_ITEM15_P239_S0	During 2011, the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits increased to $120 million from $62 million at December 31, 2010, primarily due to additional unrecognized tax benefits associated with the liquidation of a U.S. subsidiary, utilization of capital loss carryforwards and acquisitions.
97745_12_ITEM15_P239_S1	The company also reclassified $24 million of its liability for unrecognized tax benefits to short-term based on its expectations of resolving the issues within the next 12 months.
97745_12_ITEM15_P239_S2	Accordingly, of the total $120 million of liability, $24 million is classified as a current liability and the remainder is long-term.
97745_12_ITEM15_P240_S0	In 2011, the company settled the IRS audit of a refund claim relating to the 2000 and 2001 tax years which resulted in a $1.5 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_12_ITEM15_P240_S1	The company is also under audit by the IRS for the 2008 and 2009 tax years.
97745_12_ITEM15_P240_S2	It is likely that the examination phase of this audit will be completed within 12 months.
97745_12_ITEM15_P240_S3	There were no significant changes to the status of these examinations during 2011.
97745_12_ITEM15_P241_S0	During 2010 and 2009, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, all of which reduced income tax expense.
97745_12_ITEM15_P242_S0	In 2010, the company settled a Swiss audit of one of its subsidiary s 2006 and 2007 tax years which resulted in a $8.5 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_12_ITEM15_P242_S1	The company also settled the IRS audit of its 2007 tax year and the IRS completed the examination phase of its 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries in 2010 which resulted in a $1.2 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_12_ITEM15_P242_S2	Completion of the audits of the 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries is pending appeals at the IRS.
97745_12_ITEM15_P242_S3	In addition, the company settled various state income tax audits during 2010, which resulted in a $0.8 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_12_ITEM15_P243_S0	In 2009, the company settled the IRS audit of its 2005 tax year which resulted in a $0.9 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.

97745_12_ITEM15_P250_S3	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_12_ITEM15_P251_S0	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $1 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit that will expire in August 2012.
97745_12_ITEM15_P251_S1	The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_12_ITEM15_P251_S2	The rate at December 31, 2011, was between 0.40% and 1.00% (depending on duration) under the more favorable of the two rates.
97745_12_ITEM15_P252_S0	The revolving credit facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
97745_12_ITEM15_P252_S1	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.

97745_12_ITEM15_P252_S5	As of December 31, 2011, there were no borrowings under the revolver and $49 million in letters of credit outstanding, resulting in $951.0 million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility.
97745_12_ITEM15_P253_S0	In June 2011, the company obtained an additional short-term revolving credit facility that expires in June 2012 which permits borrowings up to $1 billion.
97745_12_ITEM15_P253_S1	The purpose of this revolver is to be available in the event borrowings are not possible under the company s commercial paper program, discussed below, due to credit market conditions or other events.
97745_12_ITEM15_P254_S0	Interest on the credit facility would be computed, at the company s election, based on one of several Federal Funds, Prime or LIBOR-based rates.
97745_12_ITEM15_P255_S0	The most favorable rate at December 31, 2011, was between 1.21% and 1.58% (depending on duration).
97745_12_ITEM15_P256_S0	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.

97745_12_ITEM15_P258_S0	In August 2011, the Company established a U.S. commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes).
97745_12_ITEM15_P258_S1	Maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the CP Notes rank pari passu with all of the company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
97745_12_ITEM15_P258_S2	CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment.
97745_12_ITEM15_P259_S0	CP Notes are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
97745_12_ITEM15_P259_S1	As of December 31, 2011, outstanding borrowings under this program were $900 million, with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 23 days.
97745_12_ITEM15_P259_S2	The interest rates on the outstanding CP Notes as of December 31, 2011 were between 0.38% and 0.70% with a weighted average of 0.47%.
97745_12_ITEM15_P259_S3	Borrowings under this program were used to partially fund the acquisition of Phadia (see Note 2).
97745_12_ITEM15_P260_S0	Interest on each of the senior notes is payable semi-annually.
97745_12_ITEM15_P260_S1	Each of the notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest.
97745_12_ITEM15_P261_S0	The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.
97745_12_ITEM15_P262_S0	In August 2011, the company terminated its fixed to floating rate swap arrangements on its 2.15% Senior Notes due 2012, 2.05% Senior Notes due 2014, 3.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and 3.20% Senior Notes due 2015.
97745_12_ITEM15_P262_S1	These swap arrangements were accounted for as fair value hedges.
97745_12_ITEM15_P262_S2	As a result of terminating these arrangements, the company received $63 million (excluding accrued interest) in cash.
97745_12_ITEM15_P262_S3	The proceeds were recorded as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt, which will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective debt instruments.
97745_12_ITEM15_P263_S0	Prior to issuing the 5% Senior Notes due 2015, the company entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with several banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering.
97745_12_ITEM15_P263_S1	Based on the company s conclusion that a debt offering was probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the 10-year fixed-rate debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt).
97745_12_ITEM15_P263_S2	The unfavorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $2.0 million, net of tax, and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2015.
97745_12_ITEM15_P264_S0	Prior to issuing the 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021, the company entered into hedging agreements (treasury locks) with several banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering.
97745_12_ITEM15_P264_S1	Based on the company s conclusion that a debt offering was probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the agreements hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on a significant portion of principal amount of the 10-year fixed rate debt issue (or subsequent financings of such debt).
97745_12_ITEM15_P264_S2	The company paid $59 million at the termination of this agreement.
97745_12_ITEM15_P264_S3	The unfavorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $37 million, net of tax, and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2021.
97745_12_ITEM15_P265_S0	During the first quarter of 2011 following issuance of a redemption notice by the company, holders of the company s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024 exercised conversion rights for substantially all of the remaining $329 million principal outstanding.
97745_12_ITEM15_P265_S1	The balance not converted by holders was redeemed by the company.
97745_12_ITEM15_P265_S2	The company paid the principal and the premium due upon conversion/redemption in cash for a total outlay of $452 million.
97745_12_ITEM15_P265_S3	The premium was charged to capital in excess of par value when paid.

97745_12_ITEM15_P268_S3	The premium was charged to capital in excess of par value when paid.
97745_12_ITEM15_P269_S0	The 6 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2014 were redeemed in December 2009 for a total cash outlay of $317 million, including accrued interest.
97745_12_ITEM15_P269_S1	The company recorded a loss of $5 million in 2009 on the early extinguishment of this debt in other expense, net on the accompanying statement of income.
97745_12_ITEM15_P270_S0	The company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities.
97745_12_ITEM15_P270_S1	Income from continuing operations includes expense from operating leases of $126.3 million, $128.8 million and $110.5 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM15_P270_S2	The following is a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2011:
97745_12_ITEM15_P271_S0	The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
97745_12_ITEM15_P271_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.
97745_12_ITEM15_P271_S2	The aggregate amount of the company s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $242.8 million at December 31, 2011 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2012.
97745_12_ITEM15_P272_S0	Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $117.5 million at December 31, 2011, including $3.7 million for businesses that have been sold.
97745_12_ITEM15_P272_S1	Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2020.
97745_12_ITEM15_P273_S0	Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $59.7 million at December 31, 2011.
97745_12_ITEM15_P273_S1	The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2015.
97745_12_ITEM15_P274_S0	The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required.
97745_12_ITEM15_P275_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_12_ITEM15_P275_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.
97745_12_ITEM15_P275_S2	However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.
97745_12_ITEM15_P276_S0	The company has funding commitments totaling $4.7 million at December 31, 2011, related to investments it owns.
97745_12_ITEM15_P277_S0	In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities).
97745_12_ITEM15_P277_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_12_ITEM15_P277_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_12_ITEM15_P278_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_12_ITEM15_P278_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_12_ITEM15_P279_S0	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_12_ITEM15_P279_S1	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_12_ITEM15_P279_S2	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_12_ITEM15_P280_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.
97745_12_ITEM15_P281_S0	In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
97745_12_ITEM15_P281_S1	The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.
97745_12_ITEM15_P282_S0	There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, contract, commercial and other issues.
97745_12_ITEM15_P282_S1	In view of the company s financial condition and the accruals established for these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM15_P283_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_12_ITEM15_P283_S1	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_12_ITEM15_P283_S2	The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_12_ITEM15_P284_S0	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_12_ITEM15_P284_S1	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2011, was approximately $214 million to $308 million on an undiscounted basis.
97745_12_ITEM15_P284_S2	The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger.
97745_12_ITEM15_P284_S3	The company s reserve for these matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $159 million at December 31, 2011 (or $215 million undiscounted).
97745_12_ITEM15_P284_S4	The reserve includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $89 million at December 31, 2011 (or $124 million undiscounted).
97745_12_ITEM15_P284_S5	The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger.
97745_12_ITEM15_P284_S6	In addition to the above reserves, as of December 31, 2011, the company had product liability reserves of $9 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.
97745_12_ITEM15_P285_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67%).
97745_12_ITEM15_P285_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $56 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $34 million (net discount $22 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_12_ITEM15_P286_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_12_ITEM15_P287_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_12_ITEM15_P287_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.
97745_12_ITEM15_P288_S0	Management monitors the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.
97745_12_ITEM15_P289_S0	The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters.
97745_12_ITEM15_P289_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_12_ITEM15_P289_S2	Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of permit requirements and installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented.
97745_12_ITEM15_P289_S3	The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_12_ITEM15_P289_S4	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_12_ITEM15_P289_S5	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_12_ITEM15_P290_S0	Having assumed environmental liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the estimate of loss to fair (present) value.
97745_12_ITEM15_P290_S1	This fair value was ascribed by using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest rate for monetary assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability.
97745_12_ITEM15_P290_S2	The remaining discount of $6 million is being accreted by charges to interest expense over the estimated maturity period of 30 years.
97745_12_ITEM15_P291_S0	At both December 31, 2011 and 2010, the company s total environmental liability was approximately $22 million.
97745_12_ITEM15_P292_S0	Management believes that its reserves for environmental matters are adequate for the remediation costs the company expects to incur.
97745_12_ITEM15_P292_S1	As a result, the company believes that the ultimate liability with respect to environmental remediation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM15_P292_S2	However, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_12_ITEM15_P292_S3	Although these environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party recoveries, the company may be able to bring indemnification claims against third parties for liabilities relating to certain sites.
97745_12_ITEM15_P293_S0	Comprehensive income combines net income and other comprehensive items.
97745_12_ITEM15_P293_S1	Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders equity in the accompanying balance sheet.
97745_12_ITEM15_P294_S0	Accumulated other comprehensive items in the accompanying balance sheet consist of the following:
97745_12_ITEM15_P295_S0	After-tax net losses on available-for-sale investments of $0.1 million and $0.7 million, were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items to net income in 2011 and 2009, respectively.
97745_12_ITEM15_P295_S1	An after tax gain on available-for-sale investments of $0.1 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive items to net income in 2010.
97745_12_ITEM15_P296_S0	The unrealized losses on hedging instruments relate to the company s 5% Senior Notes due 2015 and 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021 (see Note 9).
97745_12_ITEM15_P296_S1	The losses are being amortized as an increase in interest expense over the term of the related debt.
97745_12_ITEM15_P296_S2	The after-tax charges recognized in net income were $1.3 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in 2011, 2010 and 2009.
97745_12_ITEM15_P297_S0	The after-tax pension and other postretirement benefit liability adjustments recognized in net income in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $1.9 million, $1.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

97745_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole.
97745_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel and incorporated into our products or otherwise falling within our fields of interest.
97745_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.

97745_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years.
97745_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Our backlog of firm orders at year-end 2012 and 2011 was as follows:
97745_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	We believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2012 will be filled during 2013.
97745_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results.
97745_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve.
97745_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition.
97745_13_ITEM1_P97_S2	Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors.
97745_13_ITEM1_P97_S3	In general, competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development.
97745_13_ITEM1_P97_S4	Our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors:
97745_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	relative prices of our products and services.
97745_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries.
97745_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
97745_13_ITEM1_P99_S2	We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.
97745_13_ITEM1_P99_S3	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.
97745_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws.
97745_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.
97745_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws.
97745_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
97745_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters.
97745_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material.
97745_13_ITEM1_P102_S2	For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.
97745_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey, facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984.
97745_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	Our Rockford, Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action program administered by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
97745_13_ITEM1_P103_S2	We are required to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites.
97745_13_ITEM1_P103_S3	As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site.
97745_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $23 million at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM1_P104_S4	The liability for environmental matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value.
97745_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled.
97745_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur.
97745_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM1_P105_S3	However, we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies.
97745_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	As Thermo Fisher s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
97745_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies.
97745_13_ITEM1_P106_S3	While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
97745_13_ITEM1_P106_S4	To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
97745_13_ITEM1_P107_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_13_ITEM1_P107_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.

97745_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 4.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
97745_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of:
97745_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	For example, recent developments in Europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European customers and reducing our U.S. dollar revenues as translated from the euro.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	In addition, the European crisis could result in customers in Europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us, or being unable to pay at all.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain, and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The U.S. Government has been unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Unless Congress and the Administration take further action, an enforcement mechanism known as sequestration will trigger a total of $1.2 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade, divided between domestic and defense spending.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a result, government funding would be reduced for certain of our customers, including those who are dependent on funding from the National Institutes of Health, which would likely have a significant effect on these entities spending policies.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	International revenues account for a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	International revenues are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the functional currency ).
97745_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	In 2011, currency translation had a favorable effect of $244 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services, and in 2012, currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $227 million.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could have an adverse impact on us.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Some of the potential consequences, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If our security products fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	product, which could lead to product liability claims.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $12.47 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P29_S5	These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P31_S4	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our largest customer in the laboratory products business and our largest customer in the diagnostics business are also significant competitors.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with these customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability .
97745_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	provider experiences a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition, if one of these third-party package-delivery providers increase prices, and we are not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	For example, some of our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	New regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The new rule, which is effective for 2013 and requires a disclosure report to be filed by May 31, 2014, will require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	As our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P46_S5	As a result, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $7.12 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	In addition, on April 11, 2012, we terminated our prior revolving credit agreements and entered into new revolving credit facilities that provide for up to $2.0 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Recent disruptions in the financial markets, including the bankruptcy or restructuring of a number of financial institutions and reduced lending activity, may adversely affect the availability, terms and cost of credit in the future.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We cannot be sure that initiatives in response to the disruptions in the financial markets will continue to stabilize the markets in general or increase liquidity and the availability of credit to us.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The covenants in our revolving credit facilities include a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under either facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under either facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility that supports letters of credit, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.5 to 1.0.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
97745_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The location and general character of our principal properties by segment as of December 31, 2012, are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own approximately 3.4 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in California, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Utah within the U.S., and in Germany, Lithuania, Italy and the U.K.
97745_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	We lease approximately 2.2 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in Utah, Texas, Massachusetts, Colorado and Tennessee within the U.S., and in China, the U.K., Germany and Australia, under various leases that expire between 2013 and 2029.
97745_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	We own approximately 2.3 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in Virginia, Texas, Kansas and California within the U.S., and in Sweden, Germany, the U.K. and Switzerland.
97745_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	We lease approximately 1.6 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in California, Michigan, Kansas and Wisconsin within the U.S., and in Finland, Germany, the U.K., China, and France under various leases that expire between 2013 and 2023.
97745_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	We own approximately 5.2 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and North Carolina within the U.S., and in the U.K., Germany, Canada, Denmark and France.
97745_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	We lease approximately 3.8 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory, warehouse and production space, principally in California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, North Carolina and Tennessee within the U.S. and in Australia, Mexico, Germany, the U.K., and New Zealand under various leases that expire between 2013 and 2030.
97745_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	We own approximately 81,000 square feet of office space in Massachusetts.
97745_13_ITEM2_P4_S1	We also lease approximately 11,000 square feet of office space principally in Massachusetts under various leases that expire in 2013.
97745_13_ITEM2_P5_S0	We believe that all of the facilities that we are currently using are in good condition and are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs.
97745_13_ITEM2_P5_S1	If we are unable to renew any of the leases that are due to expire in 2013 or 2014, we believe that suitable replacement properties are available on commercially reasonable terms.
97745_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
97745_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including individual and consolidated multi-party product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured.
97745_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business, as well as through acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	We believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers.
97745_13_ITEM3_P0_S4	Management, after review and consideration with counsel, considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM3_P0_S5	While liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material, we currently believe, on the basis of our claims history and related factors, that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM3_P0_S6	Actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim, our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable.
97745_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	See Item 1 Business Environmental Matters, for legal proceedings involving certain environmental matters.
97745_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	We are subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies including, among others, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Agency for International Development.
97745_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	Various governmental agencies conduct investigations from time to time to examine matters relating to our operations.
97745_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	Some operations involve and have involved the handling, manufacture, use or sale of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous substances within the meaning of applicable environmental laws.
97745_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	Consequently, some risk of environmental and other damage is inherent in particular operations and products as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses, and we cannot assure that material damage will not occur or be discovered or that the damage will not be determined to be material in the future.
97745_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TMO.
97745_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of the company s common stock for 2012 and 2011, as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system.
97745_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing price of the company s common stock on December 31, 2012 and 2011, was $63.78 and $44.97, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table sets forth the per share dividends declared on the company s common stock for 2012 and 2011.
97745_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	Our payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, financial condition and other factors.
97745_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	As of February 2, 2013, the company had 5,672 holders of record of its common stock.
97745_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	This does not include holdings in street or nominee names.
97745_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	A summary of the share repurchase activity for the company s fourth quarter of 2012 follows:
97745_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	All of the shares of common stock repurchased by the company during the fourth quarter of 2012 were purchased under this program.
97745_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	company's common stock beginning January 1, 2013.
97745_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The caption restructuring and other costs in the notes below includes amounts charged to cost of revenues, primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, beginning in 2009, charges/credits to selling, general and administrative expense primarily for significant acquisition transaction costs.
97745_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	repurchase of $1.15 billion of the company s common stock.
97745_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	the repurchase of $1.34 billion of the company s common stock.
97745_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	repurchase of $1.01 billion of the company s common stock.
97745_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	repurchase of $414.6 million of the company s common stock.
97745_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	repurchase of $187.4 million of the company s common stock.
97745_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.
97745_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide.
97745_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	The company s continuing operations fall into three business segments (see Note 3): Analytical Technologies, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.
97745_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	The results of two businesses sold in April 2011 and a business sold in October 2012, have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	The results discussed below refer to the company s continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Sales in 2012 were $12.51 billion, an increase of $951 million from 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and higher sales at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $403 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues.
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and other acquisitions, net of divestitures, revenues in 2012 increased $474 million (4%) over pro forma 2011 revenues (discussed in total and by segment below).
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	The pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand.
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	Demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in 2012 and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S6	The company expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue in the near term due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe.
97745_13_ITEM7_P3_S7	The company expects slowness in industrial markets will continue in the near term due to global economic uncertainty.
97745_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in 2012 and 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	The company s principal recent acquisitions are described below.
97745_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	One Lambda, a provider of transplant diagnostics, was acquired in September 2012 to enhance the company s presence in specialty in vitro diagnostics and add new capabilities to the company s transplant-testing workflow.
97745_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Doe Ingalls, a channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to life sciences and microelectronics industries, was acquired in May 2012 to expand the company s products and services that address the production market.
97745_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Phadia, a global leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of complete blood-test systems to support the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of allergy and autoimmune diseases, was acquired in August 2011 to expand the company s specialty diagnostics offerings.
97745_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Dionex, a global leader in the manufacturing and marketing of ion and liquid chromatography and sample preparation systems, consumables, and software for chemical analysis, was acquired in May 2011 to expand the company s chromatography systems portfolio.
97745_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	In 2012, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, compared with $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and $84 million of lower acquisition-related charges in 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The increase was offset in part by commercial investments and an increase in amortization expense of $100 million in 2012, primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex.
97745_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities.
97745_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 0.9% and 9.7% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $331 million and $353 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden.
97745_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2013 will be between 5% and 7% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.
97745_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	The tax provision in 2013 will benefit from an estimated $13 million of U.S. tax credits for research and development activities in both 2012 and 2013 as a result of legislation enacted in January 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Income from continuing operations increased to $1.26 billion in 2012, from $1.02 billion in 2011, primarily due to increased operating income and lower income taxes, offset in part by higher interest expense associated with debt to fund acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	During 2012, the company s cash flow from operations totaled $2.04 billion (after deducting $28 million used by discontinued operations), compared with $1.69 billion (including $14 million from discontinued operations) for 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase resulted primarily from higher income before amortization and depreciation in 2012 compared to 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the company s short-term debt totaled $93 million, including $50 million of commercial paper obligations.
97745_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The company has revolving credit facilities with a bank group that provide up to $2.0 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The credit facilities include a $1 billion 5-year credit agreement, with the ability to request an additional $500 million, plus a $500 million 364-day credit agreement.
97745_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	If the company borrows under these facilities, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under either facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $50 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $855 million as of December 31, 2012, and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
97745_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
97745_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
97745_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources.
97745_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
97745_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due.
97745_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	Such allowances totaled $56 million at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	If the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
97745_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
97745_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
97745_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized.
97745_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $6.46 billion at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
97745_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
97745_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
97745_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.47 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors.
97745_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	Different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	Growth at some of the company s businesses slowed in 2011 and 2012 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets and economic uncertainty including a slow-down in Southern Europe.
97745_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Projections of profitability for 2013 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2012, the date of the company s impairment testing.
97745_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	There can be no assurance, however, that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 and 2012 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2013 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired.
97745_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
97745_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	The company s ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit was created with the acquisition of the Phadia Group in August 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	Because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business, its book value equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date and thus, no cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date.
97745_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	During its 2012 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit s cushion of fair value over book value had increased from 0% at the acquisition date to 9% as of November 2, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill.
97745_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied.
97745_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable.
97745_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels.
97745_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit had $1.78 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $3.30 billion as of December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	Other long-lived assets totaled $2.33 billion at December 31, 2012, including $1.73 billion of fixed assets.
97745_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset.
97745_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary.
97745_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes.
97745_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale.
97745_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company s revenue recognition would be affected.
97745_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
97745_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed.
97745_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
97745_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately.
97745_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.
97745_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers.
97745_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
97745_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns.
97745_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	The liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled $49 million at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary.
97745_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.
97745_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
97745_13_ITEM7_P39_S3	For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P39_S4	The company s reserve for these matters totaled $165 million at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P39_S5	Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
97745_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
97745_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits.
97745_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income.
97745_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance.
97745_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision.
97745_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	The company s tax valuation allowance totaled $114 million at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	Should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
97745_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
97745_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes.
97745_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company s tax provision would result.
97745_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
97745_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The accruals are based on management s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates.
97745_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Reserves of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value.
97745_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
97745_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Several of the company s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease.
97745_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels.
97745_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date.
97745_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	Net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $17 million in 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	The company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $408 million at year-end 2012 compared with $346 million at year-end 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $11 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $77 million.
97745_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	The company expects to contribute between $60 and $70 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option.
97745_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	The dividend yield is based on the company s most recent quarterly dividend rate.
97745_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures.
97745_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	Sales in 2012 were $12.51 billion, an increase of $951 million from 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, higher sales at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $403 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including $474 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $156 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, offset in part by $227 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	The pro forma increase in revenues was primarily due to increased demand.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S4	Sales growth was strong in Asia and moderate in North America and Europe.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S5	Demand from customers in academic and government markets slowed such that growth was nominal in 2012 and demand from customers in industrial markets slowed such that growth was nominal in the second half of 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S6	The company expects weakness in academic and government markets will continue in the near term due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe.
97745_13_ITEM7_P54_S7	The company expects slowness in industrial markets will continue in the near term due to global economic uncertainty.
97745_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	In 2012, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, compared with $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and $84 million of lower acquisition-related charges in 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P55_S2	The increase was offset in part by commercial investments and an increase in amortization expense of $100 million in 2012, primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex.
97745_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) processes, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives and a lower cost structure following restructuring actions including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities.
97745_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda.
97745_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14).
97745_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $231 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Dionex and Phadia.
97745_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The company incurred $81 million of cash restructuring costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P58_S2	The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated.
97745_13_ITEM7_P58_S3	The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a heating equipment business.
97745_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	As of February 27, 2013, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $80 million in 2013 and expects to identify additional actions during 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2012 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and, to a greater extent, in 2013, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P59_S2	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2011 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2011 and to a greater extent in 2012, including $30 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $15 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $35 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	On February 3, 2012, the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations that provide guidance on the excise tax imposed on the sale of medical devices under Internal Revenue Code Section 4191.
97745_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	The tax applies to the sale in the U.S. of certain medical devices by a manufacturer, producer or importer of the device.
97745_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	The tax is in the amount of 2.3% of the sale price and will apply to all devices that are sold beginning January 1, 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	Based on the company s estimate of product revenue that is expected to be subject to the regulations, the company currently expects that imposition of the tax will result in an increase in cost of product revenues of approximately $20 to $25 million annually, beginning in 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income.
97745_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3).
97745_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.
97745_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 12% to $2.38 billion in 2012 due primarily to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, existing businesses and productivity improvements offset in part by inflationary cost increases.
97745_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $278 million to $4.12 billion in 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Dionex, and higher revenue at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P63_S2	Had Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $104 million (3%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including an increase of $184 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $2 million due to acquisitions, net of a disposition, offset in part by $82 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P63_S3	The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand across the segment s range of analytical instruments and for bioscience products, offset in part by lower sales to customers in academic and government markets.
97745_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Operating income margin was 18.7% in both 2012 and 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Profit on incremental sales at existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases were substantially offset by higher spending on commercial initiatives and unfavorable currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $492 million to $2.96 billion in 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, and higher revenue at existing businesses, offset in part by the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2011, revenues would have increased $118 million (4%) over pro forma 2011 revenues, including increases of $103 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $80 million due to other acquisitions, offset in part by $65 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	The pro forma increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for clinical diagnostic products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology products.
97745_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Operating income margin was 25.7% in 2012 and 24.2% in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase resulted primarily from the accretive Phadia acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	The increases were offset in part by higher spending on commercial initiatives.
97745_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $227 million to $5.99 billion in 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Sales increased $74 million due to acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $88 million in 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $242 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand for laboratory consumables and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services.
97745_13_ITEM7_P67_S4	The increase in demand was offset in part by lower sales of laboratory equipment, particularly to customers in academic and government markets.
97745_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Operating income margin was 14.1% in both 2012 and 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	The unfavorable effects of lower sales of higher margin laboratory equipment and higher spending on commercial initiatives were offset by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	The company reported other expense, net, of $213 million and $118 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively (Note 4).
97745_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase was primarily due to an increase of $66 million in interest expense related to the debt issued to fund the Phadia and Dionex acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	In 2011, other items, net included a $28 million gain on currency exchange contracts associated with the Phadia acquisition and repayment of its multi-currency debt and an $18 million gain on the sale of an investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments to fund the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 0.9% and 9.7% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $331 million and $353 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	The decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P70_S3	The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden.
97745_13_ITEM7_P70_S4	The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P70_S5	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2013 will be between 5% and 7% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.
97745_13_ITEM7_P70_S6	The tax provision in 2013 will benefit from an estimated $13 million of U.S. tax credits for research and development activities in both 2012 and 2013 as a result of legislation enacted in January 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	On June 22, 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company s senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P71_S1	The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds.
97745_13_ITEM7_P71_S2	The results of the laboratory workstations business have been classified and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P71_S3	Prior period results have been adjusted to conform to this presentation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P71_S4	Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale, compared to $180 million in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P71_S5	The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 compared with a pre-tax loss of $6 million in 2011 due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business.
97745_13_ITEM7_P71_S6	In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture.
97745_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	In addition, the company recorded an after-tax gain of $2 million in 2012 for additional proceeds from a prior divestiture.
97745_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	On April 4, 2011, the company sold, in separate transactions, its Athena Diagnostics business (Athena) for $740 million in cash and its Lancaster Laboratories business (Lancaster) for $180 million in cash and escrowed proceeds of $20 million, substantially all of which was received in October 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P73_S1	The sale of these businesses resulted in an after-tax gain of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share.
97745_13_ITEM7_P73_S2	Revenues and operating income of the two businesses aggregated approximately $225 million and $60 million, respectively, in 2010.
97745_13_ITEM7_P73_S3	The results of both businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
97745_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	The company also received additional proceeds from a previously divested business in 2011, resulting in an after-tax gain of $1 million.
97745_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance which requires disclosure of information about significant reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	This guidance will be effective for the company in 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	In July 2012, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	The revised standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
97745_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.
97745_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	This guidance will be effective for the company in 2013.
97745_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	Adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance which requires enhanced disclosures on offsetting amounts within the balance sheet, including disclosing gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset or subject to a master netting or similar agreement.
97745_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	The guidance is effective for the company beginning January 1, 2013 and is to be applied retrospectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P77_S2	The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	In September 2011, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	The revised guidance permits an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
97745_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	If impairment is deemed more likely than not, management would perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test.
97745_13_ITEM7_P78_S3	Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required.
97745_13_ITEM7_P78_S4	This guidance was effective for the company on January 1, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P78_S5	Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance pertaining to the presentation of comprehensive income.
97745_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	The new rule eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity.
97745_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	The standard is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect the company s equity.
97745_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Under the new guidance, an entity can present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	The new guidance was effective for the company on January 1, 2012 and did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	In May 2011, the FASB amended existing rules covering fair value measurement and disclosure to clarify guidance and minimize differences between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
97745_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	The new guidance requires entities to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements and provide a narrative description of the sensitivity of Level 3 measurements to changes in unobservable inputs.
97745_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	The guidance was effective for the company on January 1, 2012 and did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters.
97745_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	In view of the company s financial condition and the accruals established for these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	However, an outcome that differs materially from current reserve estimates for one or more of the matters described in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Sales in 2011 were $11.56 billion, an increase of $1.17 billion from 2010.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia and Dionex, and, to a lesser extent, higher revenues at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	Had Phadia, Dionex and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $797 million (7%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including $125 million due to other acquisitions, net of divestitures, $266 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $406 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S3	The increase in pro forma revenues at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, offset in part by lower sales resulting from cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, and lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan as compared to 2010, which together decreased sales by approximately 1 percentage point.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S4	Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S5	The results in North America and Asia were affected by the cessation of the supply contract and the lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S6	The company had lower sales to academic and government markets in the second half of 2011 which it believes may be due to uncertainty in funding expectations in the U.S. and Europe.
97745_13_ITEM7_P83_S7	These markets represent approximately a quarter of the company s revenues and the decrease in sales to this customer base reduced the company s overall growth in the second half of 2011 by approximately 1 percentage point, although the decline moderated in the fourth quarter.
97745_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2011, operating income and operating income margin were $1.25 billion and 10.8%, respectively, compared with $1.19 billion and 11.4%, respectively, in 2010.
97745_13_ITEM7_P84_S1	The decrease in operating income margin was primarily due to $124 million of higher acquisition-related charges and an increase in amortization expense of $93 million in 2011 primarily related to the acquisitions of Phadia and Dionex.
97745_13_ITEM7_P84_S2	The decrease in operating margin was offset in part by productivity improvements and profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and existing businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P85_S0	In 2011, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $231 million, including $73 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $62 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisitions of Dionex and Phadia.
97745_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	The company incurred $81 million of cash restructuring costs, including $21 million of cash compensation from monetizing equity awards held by Dionex employees at the date of acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P85_S2	The cash costs also include continuing costs associated with headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the following: the consolidation of facilities of acquired businesses in Finland and Australia with existing facilities in those countries; the consolidation of facilities in the U.S.; and the restructuring of the commercial organization of a business across six European countries to increase productivity and efficiency in serving customers.
97745_13_ITEM7_P85_S3	The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible assets at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, a loss on sale of a heating equipment business.
97745_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	In 2010, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $76 million, including $13 million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $3 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses for transaction costs, net, primarily related to the acquisition of Dionex and revisions of estimated contingent consideration, principally related to the acquisition of Ahura Scientific, offset in part by a gain of $11 million on settlement with product liability insurers.
97745_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The company incurred $33 million of cash costs, primarily for actions initiated in 2009 and, to a lesser extent, 2010 in response to the downturn in the economy and reduced revenues, including severance to reduce headcount at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated.
97745_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	The company recorded impairment charges of $17 million for intangible assets associated with several small business units.
97745_13_ITEM7_P86_S3	The company also recorded a $6 million charge on a patent infringement claim initiated prior to a business unit s acquisition by the company and $3 million of asset writedowns associated with abandoned facilities held for sale.
97745_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2010 resulted in annual cost savings beginning primarily in 2011 of approximately $45 million, including $5 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 17% to $2.13 billion in 2011 due primarily to profit on incremental sales from acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, existing businesses as well as from productivity improvements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $607 million to $3.85 billion in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Dionex, higher revenue at existing businesses and, to a lesser extent, the favorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	effects of currency translation and $207 million (6%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand.
97745_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	Demand was particularly strong for instruments serving industrial and applied markets.
97745_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	The increase in revenues was offset in part by lower stimulus-funded sales in Japan in the first quarter of 2011 which decreased pro forma growth by 1 percentage point.
97745_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Operating income margin was 18.7% in 2011 and 17.0% in 2010.
97745_13_ITEM7_P91_S1	The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, accretive acquisitions, price increases and profit on incremental sales at existing businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P91_S2	These increases were offset in part by higher spending on research and development initiatives.
97745_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $321 million to $2.47 billion in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	The increase was due to acquisitions, including Phadia, higher revenue at existing businesses and the favorable effects of currency translation.
97745_13_ITEM7_P92_S2	Had Phadia and the company been combined from the beginning of 2010, pro forma revenues would have increased $210 million (8%) over pro forma 2010 revenues, including increases of $21 million due to other acquisitions, $68 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation and $121 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_13_ITEM7_P92_S3	The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand.
97745_13_ITEM7_P92_S4	Demand was particularly strong for immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics products.
97745_13_ITEM7_P92_S5	The increase in demand was offset in part by cessation of a supply contract, discussed below, which decreased pro forma growth by 2 percentage points.
97745_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	In November 2009, a significant supplier of the company s healthcare market channel notified the company that it intended to cease an existing supply arrangement in mid-2010.
97745_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	The company believes this was in part a response to the company s strategic decision to expand its product offerings to provide its customers with a broader menu of diagnostic solutions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P93_S2	The company signed an agreement with an alternative supplier of laboratory products and is selling these and other products from the new supplier, offsetting a portion of the drop in revenue.
97745_13_ITEM7_P93_S3	As a result of these events, sales were unfavorably affected by $54 million, net, in the first half of 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Operating income margin was 24.2% in 2011 and 22.7% in 2010.
97745_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	The increase resulted from productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales at existing businesses and accretive acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $290 million to $5.76 billion in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $107 million in 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	Sales increased $57 million due to acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM7_P95_S3	In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $126 million (2%) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_13_ITEM7_P95_S4	Demand for clinical trials logistics services was particularly strong.
97745_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Operating income margin decreased to 14.1% in 2011 from 14.3% in 2010, primarily due to inflationary pressures on costs, particularly oil-based raw materials such as plastic resin, and, to a lesser extent, commercial investments including expansion of sales and marketing staff in the Asia/Pacific region and information technology initiatives in Europe.
97745_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	These decreases were offset in part by productivity improvements.
97745_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	The company reported other expense, net, of $118 million and $100 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively (Note 4).
97745_13_ITEM7_P97_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $91 million increase in interest expense, offset in part by higher other items, net and higher interest income.
97745_13_ITEM7_P97_S2	The increase in interest expense was related to the debt issued to fund the Phadia and Dionex acquisitions, offset in part by having refinanced higher-rate debt during 2010.
97745_13_ITEM7_P97_S3	In 2011, other items, net includes a $28 million gain on currency exchange contracts associated with the Phadia acquisition and repayment of its multi-currency debt and an $18 million gain on the sale of an investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments to fund the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P97_S4	In 2010, other items, net includes a $17 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and $8 million of fees associated with short-term financing commitments for the Dionex acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 9.7% and 9.3% in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the items discussed below, offset in part by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	The tax provision in 2010 was favorably affected by $17 million or 1.6 percentage points resulting primarily from the resolution of tax audits and the impact on deferred tax balances of changes in tax rates.
97745_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	As described above, the company sold two businesses in April 2011, and another business in October 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	The results of these businesses have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented (Note 15).
97745_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	After-tax income from discontinued operations was $1.7 million and $47.0 million, in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	The sale of the two businesses sold in 2011 resulted in an after-tax gain of $304 million or $0.79 per diluted share.
97745_13_ITEM7_P99_S4	The company also received additional proceeds from a previously divested business in 2011, resulting in an after-tax gain of $1 million.
97745_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	During 2010, the company recorded additional proceeds related to a business divested in 2003, resulting in an after-tax gain of $2.5 million.
97745_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Consolidated working capital was $2.74 billion at December 31, 2012, compared with $1.71 billion at December 31, 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	Included in working capital were cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $855 million at December 31, 2012 and $1.02 billion at December 31, 2011.
97745_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	The increase in working capital is primarily due to earnings before amortization and depreciation, offset in part by the repurchase of the company s common stock.
97745_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	Cash provided by operating activities was $2.04 billion during 2012.
97745_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	An increase in inventories used cash of $60 million, primarily to support growth in sales.
97745_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	An increase in other assets used cash of $100 million primarily related to the timing of tax refunds.
97745_13_ITEM7_P102_S3	An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $127 million, primarily due to the timing of payments for incentive compensation and income taxes.
97745_13_ITEM7_P102_S4	Cash payments for income taxes of continuing operations totaled $331 million during 2012, compared with $353 million in the prior year.

97745_13_ITEM7_P103_S2	The company s discontinued operations provided $59 million of cash, primarily tax benefits from the loss on sale of the laboratory workstations business and receipt of escrowed proceeds from the 2011 sale of Lancaster Laboratories.
97745_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	The company s financing activities used $918 million of cash during 2012, principally for the repurchase of $1.15 billion of the company s common stock and to reduce commercial paper obligations by $849 million, offset in part by the issuance of $1.3 billion in senior notes (Note 9).
97745_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The company s financing activities also included the repayment of $355 million of long-term debt and $254 million of proceeds from employee stock option exercises.

97745_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	The company has revolving credit facilities with a bank group that provide up to $2.0 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	The credit facilities include a $1 billion 5-year credit agreement, with the ability to request an additional $500 million, plus a $500 million 364-day credit agreement.
97745_13_ITEM7_P105_S3	If the company borrows under these facilities, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_13_ITEM7_P105_S4	As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under either facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $50 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $855 million as of December 31, 2012, and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreements are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.

97745_13_ITEM15_P142_S4	The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises.
97745_13_ITEM15_P143_S0	Grants of stock options and restricted stock on or after November 9, 2006, provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option holder s employment, all options and service-based restricted stock awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
97745_13_ITEM15_P144_S0	Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.
97745_13_ITEM15_P145_S0	The components of pre-tax stock-based compensation expense are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P146_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is included in the accompanying statement of income as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P147_S0	The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company.
97745_13_ITEM15_P148_S0	The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates.

97745_13_ITEM15_P148_S2	Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $18.7 million, $14.6 million and $10.9 million, respectively, in 2012, 2011 and 2010.
97745_13_ITEM15_P149_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_13_ITEM15_P149_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_13_ITEM15_P149_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_13_ITEM15_P150_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_13_ITEM15_P151_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_13_ITEM15_P151_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option.
97745_13_ITEM15_P151_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_13_ITEM15_P151_S3	The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.
97745_13_ITEM15_P152_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_13_ITEM15_P153_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_13_ITEM15_P154_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P155_S0	The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $15.36, $15.79 and $14.12, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM15_P155_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $125.4 million, $85.3 million and $48.1 million, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM15_P156_S0	The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.
97745_13_ITEM15_P157_S0	A summary of option activity as of December 31, 2012 and changes during the three years then ended is presented below:
97745_13_ITEM15_P158_S0	Market price per share on December 31, 2012 was $63.78.

97745_13_ITEM15_P159_S1	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2016 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.3 years.
97745_13_ITEM15_P160_S0	The company awards to a number of key employees restricted company common stock or restricted units that convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock.
97745_13_ITEM15_P160_S1	The awards generally vest in annual installments over three to four years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions.
97745_13_ITEM15_P160_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_13_ITEM15_P160_S3	The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting.
97745_13_ITEM15_P160_S4	Recipients of restricted shares have the right to vote such shares and receive cash dividends, whereas recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to receive dividend equivalents.
97745_13_ITEM15_P161_S0	The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted share/unit awards is determined based on the number of shares/units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.
97745_13_ITEM15_P161_S1	For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

97745_13_ITEM15_P168_S0	The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability.
97745_13_ITEM15_P168_S1	This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.
97745_13_ITEM15_P168_S2	The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_13_ITEM15_P168_S3	Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_13_ITEM15_P169_S0	When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset.

97745_13_ITEM15_P174_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the company s SERP and other postretirement benefit plans:
97745_13_ITEM15_P175_S0	The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2018 and 2027.
97745_13_ITEM15_P176_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_13_ITEM15_P176_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_13_ITEM15_P177_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_13_ITEM15_P177_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_13_ITEM15_P177_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_13_ITEM15_P178_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.

97745_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM15_P187_S1	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_13_ITEM15_P187_S2	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P188_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2012 would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2012 and the 2012 aggregate of service and interest costs, as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P189_S0	The company s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework by investing in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility.
97745_13_ITEM15_P189_S1	The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities.
97745_13_ITEM15_P189_S2	The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 2% of invested assets) of private equity investments.
97745_13_ITEM15_P189_S3	The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 29% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately 6% to real estate-related equities, approximately 20% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 49% to funds investing in fixed income securities.
97745_13_ITEM15_P189_S4	The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_13_ITEM15_P190_S0	The fair values of the company s domestic plan assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, by asset category are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P191_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12).
97745_13_ITEM15_P191_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_13_ITEM15_P192_S0	The fair value of the company s private equity investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds.
97745_13_ITEM15_P192_S1	The following table represents a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs.
97745_13_ITEM15_P193_S0	The table below presents, as of December 31, 2012, the fair value measurements of investments in certain domestic plan assets that calculate and provide the company with a net asset value per share (or its equivalent).
97745_13_ITEM15_P193_S1	These plan investments are all classified as level 2 or 3 according to the fair value hierarchy:
97745_13_ITEM15_P194_S0	The domestic plan receives distributions from the private equity funds as those funds' assets are liquidated.
97745_13_ITEM15_P194_S1	The duration of the funds vary by investment with the longest ending in 2015.
97745_13_ITEM15_P195_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_13_ITEM15_P195_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_13_ITEM15_P195_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_13_ITEM15_P196_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_13_ITEM15_P196_S1	The investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 50% - 60% for equities and 40% - 50% for fixed income securities.
97745_13_ITEM15_P196_S2	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_13_ITEM15_P197_S0	The fair values of the company s non-U.S. plan assets at December 31, 2012 and 2011, by asset category are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P198_S0	The table below presents the fair value measurements of investments in certain non-U.S. plan assets that calculate and provide the company with a net asset value per share (or its equivalent).
97745_13_ITEM15_P198_S1	These plan investments are all classified as level 2 according to the fair value hierarchy:
97745_13_ITEM15_P199_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P200_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P201_S0	The income tax provision (benefit) included in the accompanying statement of income is as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P202_S0	The company receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_13_ITEM15_P202_S1	The provision for income taxes that is currently payable does not reflect $18.7 million and $14.6 million of such benefits that have been allocated to capital in excess of par value in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM15_P203_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_13_ITEM15_P204_S0	The impact of change in tax laws and apportionment on deferred taxes in 2012 includes $54.8 million of benefit from a tax rate reduction enacted in Sweden.
97745_13_ITEM15_P205_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_13_ITEM15_P206_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_13_ITEM15_P206_S1	At December 31, 2012, all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_13_ITEM15_P207_S0	At December 31, 2012, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $141.7 million, $793.8 million and $1.35 billion, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM15_P208_S0	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_13_ITEM15_P208_S1	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2013 through 2032.
97745_13_ITEM15_P208_S2	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $150.5 million expire in the years 2013 through 2031, and the remainder do not expire.
97745_13_ITEM15_P208_S3	The company also had $110.3 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2012, which expire in the years 2013 through 2022.
97745_13_ITEM15_P209_S0	A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $5.42 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost.
97745_13_ITEM15_P209_S1	During 2009, the company changed its position regarding the undistributed earnings of a Japan subsidiary and a portion of the earnings of the subsidiary are no longer considered permanently reinvested.
97745_13_ITEM15_P209_S2	During 2010, the company repatriated part of those earnings and as a result, the company provided deferred U.S. income taxes of $ 14.0 million, offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $15.6 million, on the remaining undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested overseas.
97745_13_ITEM15_P210_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the company had $164.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_13_ITEM15_P211_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P212_S0	During 2012, the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits increased primarily due to additional tax benefits associated with foreign currency transactions and interest deductions.
97745_13_ITEM15_P212_S1	Of the total $165 million of liability, $24 million is classified as a current liability and the remainder is long-term.
97745_13_ITEM15_P213_S0	During 2012, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million, all of which reduced income tax expense.
97745_13_ITEM15_P214_S0	During 2011, the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits increased primarily due to additional unrecognized tax benefits associated with the liquidation of a U.S. subsidiary, utilization of capital loss carryforwards and acquisitions.
97745_13_ITEM15_P215_S0	In 2011, the company settled the IRS audit of a refund claim relating to the 2000 and 2001 tax years which resulted in a $1.5 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_13_ITEM15_P215_S1	The company is also under audit by the IRS for the 2008 and 2009 tax years.
97745_13_ITEM15_P215_S2	It is likely that the examination phase of this audit will be completed within 12 months.
97745_13_ITEM15_P215_S3	There were no significant changes to the status of these examinations during 2012.
97745_13_ITEM15_P216_S0	During 2010, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million, all of which reduced income tax expense.
97745_13_ITEM15_P217_S0	In 2010, the company settled a Swiss audit of one of its subsidiary s 2006 and 2007 tax years which resulted in a $8.5 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_13_ITEM15_P217_S1	The company also settled the IRS audit of its 2007 tax year and the IRS completed the examination phase of its 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries in 2010 which resulted in a $1.2 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_13_ITEM15_P217_S2	Completion of the audits of the 2006 tax year and the 2006 pre-acquisition tax years of certain Fisher subsidiaries is pending appeals at the IRS.
97745_13_ITEM15_P217_S3	In addition, the company settled various state income tax audits during 2010, which resulted in a $0.8 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_13_ITEM15_P218_S0	The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
97745_13_ITEM15_P218_S1	The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $10.9 million.
97745_13_ITEM15_P219_S0	The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
97745_13_ITEM15_P219_S1	In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
97745_13_ITEM15_P219_S2	With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2007.
97745_13_ITEM15_P220_S0	Options to purchase 7.2 million, 6.9 million and 8.1 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive.
97745_13_ITEM15_P221_S0	The effective interest rates for the fixed-rate debt include the stated interest on the notes, the accretion of any discount and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging, as discussed below.
97745_13_ITEM15_P222_S0	The annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P223_S0	See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company s long-term obligations.
97745_13_ITEM15_P224_S0	Short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $91.7 million and $917.1 million at year-end 2012 and 2011, respectively, of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company s subsidiaries.
97745_13_ITEM15_P224_S1	The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 1.01% and 0.51% at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM15_P224_S2	In addition to available borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $57.9 million as of December 31, 2012.
97745_13_ITEM15_P224_S3	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S0	On April 11, 2012, the company terminated both of its prior revolving credit agreements and entered into new revolving credit facilities with a bank group that provide for up to $2.0 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S1	The new credit facilities include a $1 billion 5-year credit agreement, with the ability to request an additional $500 million, plus a $500 million 364-day credit agreement.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S2	The agreements call for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S3	The agreements contain affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S4	The financial covenant requires the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) below 3.5 to 1.0.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S5	The credit agreements permit the company to use the facilities for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S6	The 5-year credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S7	If the company borrows under these facilities, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper ($50 million at December 31, 2012) to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_13_ITEM15_P225_S8	As of December 31, 2012, no borrowings were outstanding under either facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $50 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_13_ITEM15_P226_S0	In August 2011, the Company established a U.S. commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes).
97745_13_ITEM15_P226_S1	Maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the CP Notes rank pari passu with all of the company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
97745_13_ITEM15_P226_S2	CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment.
97745_13_ITEM15_P227_S0	CP Notes are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
97745_13_ITEM15_P227_S1	As of December 31, 2012, outstanding borrowings under this program were $50 million, with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 10 days.
97745_13_ITEM15_P227_S2	The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding CP Notes as of December 31, 2012 was 0.44%.
97745_13_ITEM15_P228_S0	Interest on each of the senior notes is payable semi-annually.
97745_13_ITEM15_P228_S1	Each of the notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest.
97745_13_ITEM15_P229_S0	The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.
97745_13_ITEM15_P230_S0	In August 2011, the company terminated its fixed to floating rate swap arrangements on its 2.15% Senior Notes due 2012, 2.05% Senior Notes due 2014, 3.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and 3.20% Senior Notes due 2015.
97745_13_ITEM15_P230_S1	These swap arrangements were accounted for as fair value hedges.
97745_13_ITEM15_P230_S2	As a result of terminating these arrangements, the company received $63 million (excluding accrued interest) in cash.

97745_13_ITEM15_P231_S0	In 2005, prior to issuing the 5% Senior Notes due 2015, the company entered into forward starting pay fixed swap agreements with several banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering.
97745_13_ITEM15_P231_S1	Based on the company s conclusion that a debt offering was probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $250 million of principal amount of the 10-year fixed-rate debt issue (or any subsequent refinancing of such debt).
97745_13_ITEM15_P231_S2	The unfavorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $2.0 million, net of tax, and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2015.

97745_13_ITEM15_P232_S2	The company paid $59 million at the termination of this agreement.
97745_13_ITEM15_P232_S3	The unfavorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $37 million, net of tax, and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2021.
97745_13_ITEM15_P233_S0	During the first quarter of 2011 following issuance of a redemption notice by the company, holders of the company s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024 exercised conversion rights for substantially all of the remaining $329 million principal outstanding.

97745_13_ITEM15_P240_S1	The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2015.
97745_13_ITEM15_P241_S0	The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required.
97745_13_ITEM15_P241_S1	The outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds disclosed above include $35.6 million for businesses that have been sold.
97745_13_ITEM15_P242_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_13_ITEM15_P242_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.
97745_13_ITEM15_P242_S2	However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.
97745_13_ITEM15_P243_S0	The company has funding commitments totaling $3.4 million at December 31, 2012, related to investments it owns.
97745_13_ITEM15_P244_S0	In 2012, the company entered into an off-balance sheet build-to-suit financing arrangement with a financial institution to fund construction of an operating facility in the U.S. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease will commence with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms.
97745_13_ITEM15_P244_S1	The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 9).
97745_13_ITEM15_P244_S2	and has guaranteed the facility s residual value at the end of the lease, up to a maximum of $58 million.
97745_13_ITEM15_P245_S0	In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities).
97745_13_ITEM15_P245_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_13_ITEM15_P245_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_13_ITEM15_P246_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_13_ITEM15_P246_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_13_ITEM15_P247_S0	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_13_ITEM15_P247_S1	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_13_ITEM15_P247_S2	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_13_ITEM15_P248_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.
97745_13_ITEM15_P249_S0	In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
97745_13_ITEM15_P249_S1	The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.
97745_13_ITEM15_P250_S0	There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, contract, commercial and other issues.
97745_13_ITEM15_P250_S1	In view of the company s financial condition and the accruals established for these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM15_P251_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_13_ITEM15_P251_S1	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_13_ITEM15_P251_S2	The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_13_ITEM15_P252_S0	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_13_ITEM15_P252_S1	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2012, was approximately $215 million to $311 million on an undiscounted basis.
97745_13_ITEM15_P252_S2	The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger.
97745_13_ITEM15_P252_S3	The company s reserve for these matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $166 million at December 31, 2012 (or $216 million undiscounted).
97745_13_ITEM15_P252_S4	The reserve includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $91 million at December 31, 2012 (or $122 million undiscounted).
97745_13_ITEM15_P252_S5	The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger.
97745_13_ITEM15_P252_S6	In addition to the above reserves, as of December 31, 2012, the company had product liability reserves of $9 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.
97745_13_ITEM15_P253_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67%).
97745_13_ITEM15_P253_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $50 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $31 million (net discount $19 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_13_ITEM15_P254_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_13_ITEM15_P255_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_13_ITEM15_P255_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.
97745_13_ITEM15_P256_S0	Management monitors the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.
97745_13_ITEM15_P257_S0	The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters.
97745_13_ITEM15_P257_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_13_ITEM15_P257_S2	Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of permit requirements and installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented.
97745_13_ITEM15_P257_S3	The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_13_ITEM15_P257_S4	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_13_ITEM15_P257_S5	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_13_ITEM15_P258_S0	Having assumed environmental liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the estimate of loss to fair (present) value.
97745_13_ITEM15_P258_S1	This fair value was ascribed by using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest rate for monetary assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability.
97745_13_ITEM15_P258_S2	The remaining discount of $6 million is being accreted by charges to interest expense over the estimated maturity period of 30 years.
97745_13_ITEM15_P259_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the company s total environmental liability was approximately $23 million and $22 million, respectively.
97745_13_ITEM15_P260_S0	Management believes that its reserves for environmental matters are adequate for the remediation costs the company expects to incur.
97745_13_ITEM15_P260_S1	As a result, the company believes that the ultimate liability with respect to environmental remediation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM15_P260_S2	However, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_13_ITEM15_P260_S3	Although these environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party recoveries, the company may be able to bring indemnification claims against third parties for liabilities relating to certain sites.
97745_13_ITEM15_P261_S0	Comprehensive income combines net income and other comprehensive items.
97745_13_ITEM15_P261_S1	Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders equity in the accompanying balance sheet.

97745_13_ITEM15_P264_S1	The losses are being amortized as an increase in interest expense over the term of the related debt.
97745_13_ITEM15_P264_S2	The after-tax charges recognized in net income were $3.3 million, $1.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

97745_13_ITEM15_P268_S1	Each right entitles the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of $200 per Unit, subject to adjustment.
97745_13_ITEM15_P268_S2	The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.
97745_13_ITEM15_P269_S0	In the event that a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the common stock.
97745_13_ITEM15_P269_S1	In the event that, at any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or more of the company s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common stock.
97745_13_ITEM15_P270_S0	At any time until the Stock Acquisition Date, the company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right (payable in cash or stock).

97745_13_ITEM15_P273_S0	The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
97745_13_ITEM15_P274_S0	Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
97745_13_ITEM15_P275_S0	Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.
97745_13_ITEM15_P276_S0	Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.

97745_13_ITEM15_P279_S1	The aggregate market value, cost basis and gross unrealized gains and losses of available-for-sale investments by major security type are as follows:
97745_13_ITEM15_P280_S0	The cost of available-for-sale investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income.

97745_13_ITEM15_P288_S1	The gains on these contracts had no underlying offset in the company s income statement.
97745_13_ITEM15_P289_S0	On May 19, 2011, in connection with the planned acquisition of Phadia, the company entered into several foreign currency forward contracts to partly mitigate the currency exchange risk associated with the payment of the euro-denominated purchase price and the repayment of multi-currency debt on the Phadia books.

97745_14_ITEM1_P125_S0	Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results.
97745_14_ITEM1_P126_S0	The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve.
97745_14_ITEM1_P126_S1	Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition.
97745_14_ITEM1_P126_S2	Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors.
97745_14_ITEM1_P126_S3	In general, competitive climates in the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development.
97745_14_ITEM1_P126_S4	Our success in these markets primarily depends on the following factors:
97745_14_ITEM1_P127_S0	relative prices of our products and services.
97745_14_ITEM1_P128_S0	We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries.
97745_14_ITEM1_P128_S1	U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
97745_14_ITEM1_P128_S2	We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.
97745_14_ITEM1_P128_S3	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.
97745_14_ITEM1_P129_S0	In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws.
97745_14_ITEM1_P129_S1	Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.
97745_14_ITEM1_P130_S0	A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws.
97745_14_ITEM1_P130_S1	Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
97745_14_ITEM1_P131_S0	Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters.
97745_14_ITEM1_P131_S1	Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material.
97745_14_ITEM1_P131_S2	For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.
97745_14_ITEM1_P132_S0	Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey, facilities are the subject of administrative consent orders issued by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984.
97745_14_ITEM1_P132_S1	Our Rockford, Illinois, facility is subject to a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) corrective action program administered by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
97745_14_ITEM1_P132_S2	We are required to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites.
97745_14_ITEM1_P132_S3	As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site.
97745_14_ITEM1_P133_S0	We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_14_ITEM1_P133_S1	We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_14_ITEM1_P133_S2	We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_14_ITEM1_P133_S3	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $29 million at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM1_P133_S4	The liability for environmental matters associated with Fisher was recorded at the date of merger at its fair value and as such was discounted to its net present value.
97745_14_ITEM1_P134_S0	These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled.
97745_14_ITEM1_P134_S1	We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur.
97745_14_ITEM1_P134_S2	As a result, we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM1_P134_S3	However, we may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM1_P135_S0	Our recently acquired Life Technologies subsidiary also has certain environmental liabilities, including from its prior acquisitions, such as obligations for the clean-up of formerly-owned locations as well as several hazardous waste sites under state and federal environmental laws, in connection with its acquisitions of Dexter Corporation in 2000 and Applied Biosystems in 2008.
97745_14_ITEM1_P135_S1	Life Technologies has reserves accrued for these matters.
97745_14_ITEM1_P135_S2	Unexpected results related to the investigation and clean-up of any of these sites could cause our financial exposure in these matters to exceed stated reserves, requiring us to allocate additional funds and other resources to address these environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM1_P136_S0	Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Food and Drug Administration, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies.
97745_14_ITEM1_P136_S1	As Thermo Fisher s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
97745_14_ITEM1_P136_S2	In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies.
97745_14_ITEM1_P136_S3	While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
97745_14_ITEM1_P136_S4	To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
97745_14_ITEM1_P137_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_14_ITEM1_P137_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_14_ITEM1_P137_S2	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_14_ITEM1_P137_S3	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

97745_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 4.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
97745_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of:
97745_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	For example, recent developments in Europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	This debt crisis and related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to deteriorate, reducing the purchasing power of our European customers and reducing our U.S. dollar revenues as translated from the euro.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, the European crisis could result in customers in Europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us, or being unable to pay at all.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain, and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The U.S. Government has been unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As a result, on March 1, 2013, an enforcement mechanism known as sequestration went into effect, which will trigger a total of $1.2 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade, divided between domestic and defense spending.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Unless Congress and the Administration take further action, government funding would be reduced for certain of our customers, including those who are dependent on funding from the National Institutes of Health, which would likely have a significant effect on these entities spending policies.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Integrating the Life Technologies businesses into Thermo Fisher s existing businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The success of the acquisition of Life Technologies, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Thermo Fisher s ability to successfully combine the businesses of Thermo Fisher and Life Technologies.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The loss of key employees could adversely affect Thermo Fisher s ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which Life Technologies operated prior to closing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our common stock.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Other potential difficulties of combining the business of Thermo Fisher and Life Technologies include unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information communications and other systems.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the company.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect product demand and the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided by us in international markets, where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the functional currency ).
97745_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, reported sales made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In 2012, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $227 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services, and in 2013, currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $36 million.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could have an adverse impact on us.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Some of the potential consequences, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	With our recent acquisition of Life Technologies, we have become party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If our security products do not operate as designed and fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $12.50 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 and we will record additional goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in connection with the Life Technologies Acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P29_S5	These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability .
97745_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P33_S3	If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	For example, some of our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P35_S1	A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	New regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	On August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The new rule, which is effective for 2013 and requires a disclosure report to be filed by May 31, 2014, will require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	As our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, earthquakes, or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P45_S4	In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $10.49 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $1.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit and a $5.00 billion term facility that we entered into to partially finance the Life Technologies Acquisition (which we drew down in the first quarter of 2014).
97745_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The covenants in our revolving credit facility and the term credit facility that we entered into to partially finance the Life Technologies Acquisition include a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under either facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under either facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 5.5 to 1.0 during the first six months after the closing date of the Life Technologies Acquisition (which was February 3, 2014) and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, after 18 months or the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense) to be less than 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
97745_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The location and general character of our principal properties by segment are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own approximately 2.2 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in California, New York, Utah, Maryland and Illinois within the U.S., and in the U.K., Lithuania and New Zealand.

97745_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	We own approximately 81,000 square feet of office space in Massachusetts.
97745_14_ITEM2_P5_S1	We also lease approximately 22,000 square feet of office space in Massachusetts under a lease that expires in 2015.
97745_14_ITEM2_P6_S0	We believe that all of the facilities that we are currently using are in good condition and are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs.
97745_14_ITEM2_P6_S1	If we are unable to renew any of the leases that are due to expire in 2014 or 2015, we believe that suitable replacement properties are available on commercially reasonable terms.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	Our business involves a risk of product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are a party to various lawsuits and legal proceedings, including individual and consolidated multi-party product liability actions for products we may have distributed or manufactured.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S2	These matters have arisen in the ordinary course and conduct of our business, as well as through acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S3	We believe that some of the costs incurred in defending and ultimately disposing of many of these claims for personal injury and other matters may be covered in part by insurance policies maintained by certain insurance carriers or subject to indemnification by our suppliers or purchasers.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S4	Management, after review and consideration with counsel, considers that any ultimate liability with respect to these matters should not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S5	While liabilities arising from potential future claims could become material, we currently believe, on the basis of our claims history and related factors, that such potential future claims are not likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S6	Actual costs incurred will depend on the solvency of our insurance carriers, the degree of coverage with respect to any particular claim, our success in litigating these claims and the solvency of third parties who may be jointly and severally liable.
97745_14_ITEM3_P0_S7	See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies.
97745_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	On February 3, 2014, we acquired Life Technologies.

97745_14_ITEM3_P5_S3	Although a jury initially found willful infringement and assessed damages at $52 million, the District Court subsequently overturned the verdict on the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to prove infringement.
97745_14_ITEM3_P5_S4	The District Court entered judgment in favor of Life Technologies, and the case is currently on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
97745_14_ITEM3_P5_S5	The $52 million award has been accrued by Life Technologies.

97745_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	One Lambda, a provider of transplant diagnostics, was acquired in September 2012 to enhance the company s presence in specialty in vitro diagnostics and to increase access to the transplant diagnostics market.
97745_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Doe Ingalls, a channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to the life sciences and microelectronics industries, was acquired in May 2012 to expand the company s products and services that address the production market.
97745_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	In addition, on April 14, 2013, the company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Life Technologies providing for the acquisition of Life Technologies by the company (the Life Technologies Acquisition ) at a price of approximately $13.6 billion in cash ($76.1311786 per share), plus the assumption of certain Life Technologies indebtedness (Note 2).
97745_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Life Technologies provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing.
97745_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Life Technologies revenues totaled $3.9 billion in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The acquisition was completed on February 3, 2014.
97745_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	Life Technologies will be reported in a new segment, Life Sciences Solutions, together with most of the company s existing biosciences businesses.
97745_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The company completed its permanent financing arrangements for the Life Technologies Acquisition in December 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	The financing consists of a term loan agreement (the Term Credit Facility ), proceeds from issuance of senior debt and commercial paper, proceeds from equity forward agreements and cash on hand.
97745_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	These arrangements are discussed below under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources .
97745_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	In December 2013, the company entered an agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for approximately $1.06 billion.
97745_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The businesses fall principally in the Analytical Technologies segment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies Acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	As of December 31, 2013, the agreement to sell the businesses was contingent on, among other things, obtaining antitrust approval for the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	That approval was obtained in January 2014 at which time these businesses were designated as held for sale.
97745_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	Revenues and operating income in 2013 of the businesses to be sold were approximately $250 million and $80 million, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM7_P8_S6	The sale is subject to additional regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	In February 2013, in connection with a change in management responsibility for two product lines with aggregate annual revenues of approximately $100 million, the company transferred its water analysis and research serum and media product lines to the Laboratory Products and Services segment from the Analytical Technologies segment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported.
97745_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers.
97745_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Sales in 2013 were $13.09 billion, an increase of $580 million from 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales to customers in industrial markets grew modestly.
97745_14_ITEM7_P11_S4	Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America.
97745_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S6	In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S7	The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S8	The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S9	The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S10	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2014 will be between 2% and 5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.
97745_14_ITEM7_P14_S11	The tax credit for research and development activities has not been extended by the U.S. Congress as of February 26, 2014.
97745_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	Income from continuing operations increased to $1.28 billion in 2013, from $1.26 billion in 2012, primarily due to improved operating performance, offset in part by $126 million of costs related to the acquisition and financing of Life Technologies.
97745_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	During 2013, the company s cash flow from operations totaled $2.01 billion (after deducting $5 million used by discontinued operations), compared with $2.04 billion (after deducting $28 million from discontinued operations) for 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The decrease resulted in part from cash disbursements for fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments and other transaction costs, totaling $108 million, related to the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	In addition, higher increases in working capital items than in 2012 were partially offset in part by higher income before amortization and depreciation in 2013 compared to 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the company s short-term debt totaled $988 million, including $250 million of commercial paper obligations and $706 million of senior notes, due in 2014.
97745_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $1.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $43 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Of the company s existing cash and short-term investments of $5.83 billion as of December 31, 2013, $5.18 billion was available to partially fund the acquisition of Life Technologies in February 2014.
97745_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The company believes that the remaining balance of approximately $650 million and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing and Life Technologies businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
97745_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
97745_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
97745_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources.
97745_14_ITEM7_P19_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
97745_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due.
97745_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Such allowances totaled $54 million at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	If the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
97745_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
97745_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
97745_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized.
97745_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.
97745_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $5.73 billion at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
97745_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
97745_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
97745_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.50 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors.
97745_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Growth at some of the company s businesses slowed in 2011 2013 which the company believes was in part due to uncertainty in funding expectations of customers in academic and government markets and economic uncertainty including a slow-down in Southern Europe.
97745_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	Projections of profitability for 2014 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2013, the date of the company s impairment testing.
97745_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	There can be no assurance, however, that the slowing of growth experienced in 2011 - 2013 at some businesses will not continue or worsen in 2014 and that a downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired.
97745_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	Should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
97745_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The company s ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit was created with the acquisition of the Phadia Group in August 2011.
97745_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	Because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business, its book value equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date and thus, no cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date.
97745_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	During its 2013 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit s cushion of fair value over book value had increased from 0% at the acquisition date to 11% as of November 1, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill.
97745_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied.
97745_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable.
97745_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels.
97745_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The ImmunoDiagnostics reporting unit had $1.80 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $3.31 billion as of December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Other long-lived assets totaled $2.41 billion at December 31, 2013, including $1.77 billion of fixed assets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset.
97745_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary.
97745_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes.
97745_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale.
97745_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	Should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company s revenue recognition would be affected.
97745_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
97745_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
97745_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements.
97745_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements.
97745_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed.
97745_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
97745_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately.
97745_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.
97745_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers.
97745_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
97745_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns.
97745_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled $50 million at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary.
97745_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.
97745_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
97745_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
97745_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	The company s reserve for these matters totaled $134 million at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
97745_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
97745_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits.
97745_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income.
97745_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance.
97745_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision.
97745_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	The company s tax valuation allowance totaled $77 million at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	Should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
97745_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	T he company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
97745_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes.
97745_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company s tax provision would result.
97745_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
97745_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The accruals are based on management s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates.
97745_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Reserves of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental reserves, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value.
97745_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
97745_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Several of the company s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease.
97745_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels.
97745_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date.
97745_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $29 million in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	The company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $301 million at year-end 2013 compared with $408 million at year-end 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $3 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $85 million.
97745_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the company expects to contribute between $30 and $40 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2014.
97745_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option.
97745_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	The dividend yield is based on the company s most recent quarterly dividend rate.
97745_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures.
97745_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required.
97745_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	Sales in 2013 were $13.09 billion, an increase of $580 million from 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales growth was modest to customers in industrial markets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P57_S4	Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America.
97745_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
97745_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, revisions of estimated contingent consideration for a recent acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14).
97745_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2).
97745_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda.
97745_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The company incurred $67 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated.
97745_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible asset at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	As of February 27, 2014, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $50 million in 2014 and expects to identify additional actions during 2014, including some related to the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2013 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and, to a greater extent, in 2014, including $35 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2012 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and to a greater extent in 2013, including $40 million in the Analytical Technologies segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The company expects significant restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2014 in connection with the acceleration of certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees and severance obligations payable to former Life Technologies executives.
97745_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income.
97745_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3).
97745_14_ITEM7_P64_S3	Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.
97745_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 7% to $2.55 billion in 2013 due primarily to productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
97745_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Sales in the Analytical Technologies segment increased $107 million to $4.13 billion in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Sales increased $123 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $9 million due to acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $25 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments as well as bioscience products, offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products which the company believes were affected by macro economic conditions facing customers in industrial markets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Operating income margin was 18.6% in 2013 compared to 18.6% in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	Operating margin was favorably affected by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
97745_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $229 million to $3.19 billion in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Sales increased $143 million due to an acquisition and $92 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $5 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, particularly for clinical diagnostics products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology and allergy products in part as a result of strong flu and pollen seasons, partially offset by weakness from reduced healthcare utilization and lower sales of instruments to diagnostic laboratories due in part to lower healthcare reimbursement rates in the U.S. for anatomical pathology tests.
97745_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Operating income margin was 27.2% in 2013 and 25.7% in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales from an acquisition and, to a lesser extent, at existing businesses as well as productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and imposition of the medical device excise tax in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $297 million to $6.35 billion in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	Sales increased $267 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $36 million due to an acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM7_P70_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $6 million in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P70_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and clinical trial logistics services.
97745_14_ITEM7_P70_S4	Sales of laboratory equipment increased only modestly due to weakness in demand from customers in academic and government markets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	Operating income margin was 14.5% in 2013 and 14.4% in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, price increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.
97745_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	The company reported other expense, net, of $290 million and $213 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively (Note 4).
97745_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	In the first quarter of 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.
97745_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	In 2013, other items, net also includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies Acquisition, offset in part by gains totaling $5 million from sales of equity investments.
97745_14_ITEM7_P73_S2	Interest expense increased $21 million primarily due to the debt issued to fund the One Lambda and Life Technologies acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S3	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S4	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S5	The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S6	In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S7	The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S8	The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S9	The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S10	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2014 will be between 2% and 5% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.
97745_14_ITEM7_P74_S11	The tax credit for research and development activities has not been extended by the U.S. Congress as of February 26, 2014.
97745_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The company has operations and a taxable presence in nearly 50 countries outside of the U.S.
97745_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	All of these countries except three have a lower tax rate than the U.S.
97745_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
97745_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	The company s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries.
97745_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	Based on the dispersion of the company s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.
97745_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	On June 22, 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company s senior management made a decision to pursue a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment.

97745_14_ITEM7_P76_S2	Revenues of the laboratory workstations business were $147 million in the 2012 period prior to the sale.
97745_14_ITEM7_P76_S3	The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business.
97745_14_ITEM7_P76_S4	In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture.
97745_14_ITEM7_P76_S5	The loss in 2013 for discontinued operations primarily represents a charge for the cost of razing abandoned facilities of the business prior to sale of the land.
97745_14_ITEM7_P76_S6	The results of the laboratory workstations business have been included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
97745_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance which requires disclosure of information about significant reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements.
97745_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	This guidance became effective for the company in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	Adoption of this standard, which is related to disclosure only, did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	In July 2012, the FASB modified existing rules to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	The revised standard allows an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired.
97745_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired.
97745_14_ITEM7_P78_S3	This guidance became effective for the company in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM7_P78_S4	Adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

97745_14_ITEM7_P91_S1	Sales increased $74 million due to acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM7_P91_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $89 million in 2012.
97745_14_ITEM7_P91_S3	In addition to the changes in revenue resulting from acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $238 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand for laboratory consumables and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services.
97745_14_ITEM7_P91_S4	The increase in demand was offset in part by lower sales of laboratory equipment, particularly to customers in academic and government markets.
97745_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	Operating income margin was 14.4% in 2012 and 14.3% in 2011.
97745_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	The increase resulted from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by lower sales of higher margin laboratory equipment and higher spending on commercial initiatives.
97745_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	The company reported other expense, net, of $213 million and $118 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

97745_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $331 million and $353 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	The decrease in the effective tax rate was due in part to increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions including the effect of the Phadia acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden.
97745_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	The tax provision in 2011 was unfavorably affected by $12 million, or 1.0 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, offset in part by $8 million, or 0.7 percentage points, by the ability to use tax loss carryforwards as a result of the Phadia acquisition.

97745_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates.
97745_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A 10% depreciation in year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $85 million.
97745_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	A 10% appreciation in year-end 2013 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $85 million.
97745_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.
97745_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Certain of the company s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.

97745_14_ITEM15_P125_S2	Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies Acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM15_P125_S3	As of December 31, 2013, the agreement to sell the businesses was contingent on, among other things, obtaining antitrust approval for the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_14_ITEM15_P125_S4	That approval was obtained in January 2014 at which time these businesses were designated as held for sale.
97745_14_ITEM15_P125_S5	Revenues and operating income in 2013 of the businesses to be sold were approximately $250 million and $80 million, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM15_P125_S6	The sale is subject to additional regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	The assets and liabilities of the businesses to be sold were as follows at December 31, 2013:
97745_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	In October 2012, the company sold its laboratory workstations business and in April 2011, the company sold its Athena Diagnostics business and its Lancaster Laboratories business (see Note 15).
97745_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	In May 2011, the company sold a manufacturer of heating equipment for $ 14 million and recorded a pre-tax loss on the sale of $ 3 million, included in restructuring and other costs, net.
97745_14_ITEM15_P127_S2	Operating results of the business were not material.
97745_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	At December 31, 2013, the company s continuing operations fell into three business segments as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	Analytical Technologies: provides a broad offering of instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory, on the production line and in the field.
97745_14_ITEM15_P129_S1	These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.
97745_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	Specialty Diagnostics: provides a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses.
97745_14_ITEM15_P130_S1	These products are used primarily by customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial and food safety laboratories.
97745_14_ITEM15_P131_S0	Laboratory Products and Services: provides virtually everything needed for the laboratory, including a combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and an extensive service offering.
97745_14_ITEM15_P131_S1	These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.
97745_14_ITEM15_P132_S0	In February 2013, in connection with a change in management responsibility for two product lines, the company transferred its water analysis and research serum and media product lines to the Laboratory Products and Services segment from the Analytical Technologies segment.
97745_14_ITEM15_P132_S1	The company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported.
97745_14_ITEM15_P132_S2	Prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers.
97745_14_ITEM15_P133_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_14_ITEM15_P133_S1	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.
97745_14_ITEM15_P134_S0	(a) Represents operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring and other costs, net; and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
97745_14_ITEM15_P135_S0	(b) The company does not allocate other expense, net to its segments.
97745_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	(c) C orporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, property and equipment at the company's corporate offices and assets of the discontinued operations.
97745_14_ITEM15_P137_S0	(d) Revenues are attributed to countries based on customer location.
97745_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	(e) Includes property, plant and equipment, net.
97745_14_ITEM15_P139_S0	The components of other expense, net, in the accompanying statement of income are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	In 2013, other items, net includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies Acquisition offset in part by $5 million of gains from sales of equity investments.
97745_14_ITEM15_P140_S1	Additionally, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.
97745_14_ITEM15_P141_S0	In 2011, other items, net includes $28 million of gains on currency exchange contracts associated with the acquisition of Phadia and an $18 million gain on the sale of an equity investment accounted for under the cost method, offset in part by $10 million of fees associated with a short-term financing commitment to fund the Phadia acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others.
97745_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company s Board of Directors or for certain non-officer grants, by the company s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer.
97745_14_ITEM15_P142_S2	The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings.
97745_14_ITEM15_P142_S3	Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
97745_14_ITEM15_P143_S0	Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.
97745_14_ITEM15_P144_S0	Stock-based compensation expense is included in the accompanying statement of income as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P145_S0	The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company.
97745_14_ITEM15_P146_S0	The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates.
97745_14_ITEM15_P146_S1	The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes.
97745_14_ITEM15_P146_S2	Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $46.6 million, $18.7 million and $14.6 million, respectively, in 2013, 2012 and 2011.
97745_14_ITEM15_P147_S0	The company s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value.
97745_14_ITEM15_P147_S1	Options vest over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P147_S2	Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P148_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_14_ITEM15_P148_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_14_ITEM15_P148_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_14_ITEM15_P149_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_14_ITEM15_P150_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_14_ITEM15_P150_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option.
97745_14_ITEM15_P150_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_14_ITEM15_P150_S3	The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.
97745_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_14_ITEM15_P153_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P154_S0	A summary of the company s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is presented below:
97745_14_ITEM15_P155_S0	(a) Market price per share on December 31, 2013 was $111.35.
97745_14_ITEM15_P155_S1	The intrinsic value is zero for options with exercise prices above the market price.
97745_14_ITEM15_P156_S0	As of December 31, 2013, there was $63 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted.
97745_14_ITEM15_P156_S1	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2017 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years.
97745_14_ITEM15_P157_S0	Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock.
97745_14_ITEM15_P157_S1	The awards generally vest over 3-4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P157_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P157_S3	The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_14_ITEM15_P157_S4	Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to receive dividend equivalents.
97745_14_ITEM15_P158_S0	The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.
97745_14_ITEM15_P158_S1	For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.
97745_14_ITEM15_P159_S0	A summary of the company s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2013 is presented below:
97745_14_ITEM15_P160_S0	Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company.
97745_14_ITEM15_P160_S1	Shares may be purchased under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period.
97745_14_ITEM15_P160_S2	Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee s gross wages.
97745_14_ITEM15_P160_S3	The company issued 100,000, 151,000 and 139,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 plan years, which ended on December 31.
97745_14_ITEM15_P161_S0	The company s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees.
97745_14_ITEM15_P161_S1	Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company.
97745_14_ITEM15_P161_S2	Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P161_S3	Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company.
97745_14_ITEM15_P161_S4	In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the company charged to expense $87.3 million, $86.0 million and $79.4 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.
97745_14_ITEM15_P162_S0	Employees of a number of the company s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries.
97745_14_ITEM15_P162_S1	Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws.
97745_14_ITEM15_P162_S2	The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate.
97745_14_ITEM15_P162_S3	The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.
97745_14_ITEM15_P163_S0	The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability.
97745_14_ITEM15_P163_S1	This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.
97745_14_ITEM15_P163_S2	The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_14_ITEM15_P163_S3	Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_14_ITEM15_P164_S0	When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset.
97745_14_ITEM15_P164_S1	The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.
97745_14_ITEM15_P165_S0	The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.
97745_14_ITEM15_P165_S1	During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the company made cash contributions of approximately $38.2 million, $23.3 million and $25.3 million, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM15_P165_S2	Additionally, in 2013 the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans.
97745_14_ITEM15_P165_S3	Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $30 and $40 million for 2014.
97745_14_ITEM15_P166_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the company s domestic and non-U.S. pension plans and postretirement benefit plans:
97745_14_ITEM15_P167_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P168_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table:
97745_14_ITEM15_P169_S0	The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2018 and 2027.
97745_14_ITEM15_P170_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_14_ITEM15_P170_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_14_ITEM15_P171_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_14_ITEM15_P171_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_14_ITEM15_P171_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_14_ITEM15_P172_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.
97745_14_ITEM15_P173_S0	The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management s expectations of future salary increases.
97745_14_ITEM15_P174_S0	The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2014 are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P175_S0	The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P176_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P177_S0	The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.
97745_14_ITEM15_P178_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM15_P178_S1	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_14_ITEM15_P178_S2	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P179_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2013 would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013 and the 2013 aggregate of service and interest costs, as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P180_S0	The company s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates.
97745_14_ITEM15_P180_S1	The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility.
97745_14_ITEM15_P180_S2	The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities.
97745_14_ITEM15_P180_S3	The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 2% of invested assets) of private equity investments.
97745_14_ITEM15_P180_S4	The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 25% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately 5% to real estate-related equities, approximately 15% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 60% to funds investing in fixed income securities.
97745_14_ITEM15_P180_S5	The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_14_ITEM15_P181_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_14_ITEM15_P181_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_14_ITEM15_P181_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_14_ITEM15_P182_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_14_ITEM15_P182_S1	For plans not currently managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 55% - 70% for equities and 30% - 45% for fixed income securities.
97745_14_ITEM15_P182_S2	For plans managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments also include hedge funds, multi-asset funds and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 3% - 10% for equities, 40% - 55% for fixed income, 15% - 28% for hedge funds, 2% - 5% for multi-asset funds and 18% - 22% for funds holding derivatives.
97745_14_ITEM15_P182_S3	The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P182_S4	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_14_ITEM15_P183_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12).
97745_14_ITEM15_P183_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P184_S0	The fair value of the company s private equity investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds.
97745_14_ITEM15_P185_S0	There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension plan assets during the years presented.
97745_14_ITEM15_P186_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P187_S0	The income tax provision (benefit) included in the accompanying statement of income is as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P188_S0	The company receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_14_ITEM15_P188_S1	The provision for income taxes that is currently payable does not reflect $46.6 million and $18.7 million of such benefits that have been allocated to capital in excess of par value in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM15_P189_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_14_ITEM15_P190_S0	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_14_ITEM15_P190_S1	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM15_P190_S2	In addition, the impact of tax law changes in certain foreign jurisdictions reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2013.
97745_14_ITEM15_P190_S3	The impact of change in tax laws and apportionment on deferred taxes in 2012 includes $ 55 million of benefit from a tax rate reduction enacted in Sweden.
97745_14_ITEM15_P191_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_14_ITEM15_P192_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized.
97745_14_ITEM15_P192_S1	At December 31, 2013, all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_14_ITEM15_P193_S0	At December 31, 2013, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $130.2 million, $891.9 million and $1.89 billion, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM15_P194_S0	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_14_ITEM15_P194_S1	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2014 through 2033.
97745_14_ITEM15_P194_S2	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $303.8 million expire in the years 2014 through 2032, and the remainder do not expire.
97745_14_ITEM15_P194_S3	The company also had $203.0 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2013, which expire in the years 2014 through 2023.
97745_14_ITEM15_P195_S0	A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $5.97 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost.
97745_14_ITEM15_P195_S1	Determining the deferred tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted is not practicable.
97745_14_ITEM15_P196_S0	As of December 31, 2013, the company had $134.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_14_ITEM15_P197_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P198_S0	The company expects that the unrecognized tax benefits will increase in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_14_ITEM15_P199_S0	During 2013, the company settled the IRS audit relating to the 2008 and 2009 tax years which resulted in a decrease in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $8.9 million.
97745_14_ITEM15_P199_S1	The liability was also reduced by $21.0 million due to the company s withdrawal of a U.S. court case relating to the 2001 to 2003 tax years.
97745_14_ITEM15_P199_S2	Additionally, in 2013, the company benefited from a favorable resolution of a court case in Sweden which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $21.1 million.
97745_14_ITEM15_P199_S3	Of the total $21.1 million, $16.9 million reduced income tax expense.
97745_14_ITEM15_P199_S4	Of the total $134 million of liability, $5 million is classified as a current liability and the remainder is long-term.
97745_14_ITEM15_P200_S0	During 2012, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million, all of which reduced income tax expense.
97745_14_ITEM15_P201_S0	During 2011, the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits increased primarily due to additional unrecognized tax benefits associated with the liquidation of a U.S. subsidiary, utilization of capital loss carryforwards and acquisitions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P202_S0	In 2011, the company settled the IRS audit of a refund claim relating to the 2000 and 2001 tax years which resulted in a $1.5 million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits.
97745_14_ITEM15_P203_S0	The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
97745_14_ITEM15_P203_S1	The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $14.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM15_P204_S0	The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P204_S1	In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.
97745_14_ITEM15_P204_S2	With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2010.
97745_14_ITEM15_P205_S0	Options to purchase 1.0 million, 7.2 million and 6.9 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive.
97745_14_ITEM15_P206_S0	The effective interest rates for the fixed-rate debt include the stated interest on the notes, the accretion of any discount and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging, as discussed below.
97745_14_ITEM15_P207_S0	The annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows:
97745_14_ITEM15_P208_S0	See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company s long-term obligations.
97745_14_ITEM15_P209_S0	Short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $280.0 million and $91.7 million at year-end 2013 and 2012, respectively, of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company s subsidiaries.
97745_14_ITEM15_P209_S1	The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 0.58% and 1.01% at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM15_P209_S2	In addition to available borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $60.8 million as of December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM15_P209_S3	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_14_ITEM15_P210_S0	In 2013, the company entered a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $ 1.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_14_ITEM15_P210_S1	The facility expires in July 2018.
97745_14_ITEM15_P210_S2	The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_14_ITEM15_P210_S3	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_14_ITEM15_P210_S4	The financial covenant requires the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) below 3.5 to 1.0 prior to the closing date of the Life Technologies Acquisition, below 5.5 to 1.0 during the first six months after the closing date of the Life Technologies Acquisition and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, after 18 months and an Interest Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) to interest expense below 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_14_ITEM15_P211_S0	The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes.
97745_14_ITEM15_P211_S1	The credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
97745_14_ITEM15_P211_S2	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper ($250 million at December 31, 2013) to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_14_ITEM15_P211_S3	As of December 31, 2013, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $43 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_14_ITEM15_P212_S0	The company has a U.S. commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes).
97745_14_ITEM15_P212_S1	Maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the CP Notes rank pari passu with all of the company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
97745_14_ITEM15_P212_S2	CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment.
97745_14_ITEM15_P213_S0	CP Notes are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
97745_14_ITEM15_P213_S1	As of December 31, 2013, outstanding borrowings under this program were $250 million, with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 12 days.
97745_14_ITEM15_P213_S2	The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding CP Notes as of December 31, 2013 was 0.47%.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S0	In connection with the planned acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into a bridge credit agreement and a term loan agreement.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S1	The bridge credit agreement was a 364-day unsecured committed bridge facility which was terminated in December 2013 by the company upon securing long-term financing for the acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S2	The term loan agreement is a 3-year unsecured $5 billion term loan facility.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S3	In January 2014, the company borrowed $5.00 billion under the term loan facility to partially fund the acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S4	The term loan agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S5	The term loan agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S6	The financial covenants require the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) below 5.5 to 1.0 during the first six months after the borrowing date and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, beginning 18 months after the borrowing date.
97745_14_ITEM15_P214_S7	The company must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_14_ITEM15_P215_S0	Interest on each of the senior notes is payable semi-annually.
97745_14_ITEM15_P215_S1	Each of the notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest.
97745_14_ITEM15_P216_S0	The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.
97745_14_ITEM15_P217_S0	In December 2013, upon the issuance of $900 million principal amount of 1.30% Senior Notes due 2017, the company entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks.
97745_14_ITEM15_P217_S1	The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 1.30% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the 1.30% Notes.
97745_14_ITEM15_P217_S2	The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.6616% (0.83% at December 31, 2013) and to receive a fixed rate of 1.30%.
97745_14_ITEM15_P217_S3	The variable interest rate resets monthly.
97745_14_ITEM15_P217_S4	The swaps have been accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 1.30% Notes.
97745_14_ITEM15_P217_S5	See Note 12 for additional information.
97745_14_ITEM15_P218_S0	In August 2011, the company terminated its fixed to floating rate swap arrangements on its 2.15% Senior Notes due 2012, 2.05% Senior Notes due 2014, 3.25% Senior Notes due 2014 and 3.20% Senior Notes due 2015.
97745_14_ITEM15_P218_S1	These swap arrangements were accounted for as fair value hedges.
97745_14_ITEM15_P218_S2	As a result of terminating these arrangements, the company received $63 million (excluding accrued interest) in cash.
97745_14_ITEM15_P218_S3	The proceeds were recorded as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt, which will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective debt instruments.
97745_14_ITEM15_P219_S0	In 2013, prior to issuing the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering.
97745_14_ITEM15_P219_S1	Based on the company s conclusion that a debt offering was probable as a result of near-term debt maturities and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $700 million of principal amount of the planned 10-year fixed-rate debt issue.
97745_14_ITEM15_P219_S2	In December 2013, the company issued senior notes and terminated the swap arrangements.
97745_14_ITEM15_P219_S3	The company received $11 million at the termination of these agreements and recorded a gain of $1 million on the ineffective portion in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income.
97745_14_ITEM15_P219_S4	The remaining favorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination (the effective portion) was $6 million, net of tax, and was classified as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholder s equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2024.
97745_14_ITEM15_P220_S0	In 2011, prior to issuing the 3.60% Senior Notes due 2021, the company entered into hedging agreements (treasury locks) with several banks to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering.
97745_14_ITEM15_P220_S1	Based on the company s conclusion that a debt offering was probable and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the agreements hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $850 million of principal amount of the 10-year fixed rate debt issue (or subsequent financings of such debt).
97745_14_ITEM15_P220_S2	The company paid $59 million at the termination of this agreement.
97745_14_ITEM15_P220_S3	The unfavorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination was $37 million, net of tax, and was classified as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2021.
97745_14_ITEM15_P221_S0	During the first quarter of 2011 following issuance of a redemption notice by the company, holders of the company s 3.25% Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2024 exercised conversion rights for substantially all of the remaining $329 million principal outstanding.
97745_14_ITEM15_P221_S1	The balance not converted by holders was redeemed by the company.
97745_14_ITEM15_P221_S2	The company paid the principal and the premium due upon conversion/redemption in cash for a total outlay of $452 million.
97745_14_ITEM15_P221_S3	The premium was charged to capital in excess of par value when paid.
97745_14_ITEM15_P222_S0	The company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities.
97745_14_ITEM15_P222_S1	Income from continuing operations includes expense from operating leases of $127.9 million, $125.5 million and $125.3 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
97745_14_ITEM15_P222_S2	The following is a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2013:
97745_14_ITEM15_P223_S0	The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
97745_14_ITEM15_P223_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.
97745_14_ITEM15_P223_S2	The aggregate amount of the company s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $290.7 million at December 31, 2013 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2014.
97745_14_ITEM15_P224_S0	Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $103.0 million at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM15_P224_S1	Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2020.
97745_14_ITEM15_P225_S0	Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $52.8 million at December 31, 2013.
97745_14_ITEM15_P225_S1	The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2015.
97745_14_ITEM15_P226_S0	The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required.
97745_14_ITEM15_P226_S1	The outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds disclosed above include $4.8 million for businesses that have been sold.
97745_14_ITEM15_P227_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_14_ITEM15_P227_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.
97745_14_ITEM15_P227_S2	However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.
97745_14_ITEM15_P228_S0	The company has funding commitments totaling $1.1 million at December 31, 2013, related to investments it owns.
97745_14_ITEM15_P229_S0	In 2012, the company entered into an off-balance sheet build-to-suit financing arrangement with a financial institution to fund construction of an operating facility in the U.S. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease will commence with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms.
97745_14_ITEM15_P229_S1	The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 9), and has guaranteed the facility s residual value at the end of the lease, up to a maximum of $58 million.
97745_14_ITEM15_P230_S0	In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities).
97745_14_ITEM15_P230_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_14_ITEM15_P230_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_14_ITEM15_P231_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_14_ITEM15_P231_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_14_ITEM15_P232_S0	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_14_ITEM15_P232_S1	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_14_ITEM15_P232_S2	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_14_ITEM15_P233_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.
97745_14_ITEM15_P234_S0	In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
97745_14_ITEM15_P234_S1	The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.
97745_14_ITEM15_P235_S0	There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, contract, commercial and other issues.
97745_14_ITEM15_P235_S1	In view of the company s financial condition and the accruals established for these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate liability, if any, related to these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM15_P236_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts needed to pay damages in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_14_ITEM15_P236_S1	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_14_ITEM15_P236_S2	The reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_14_ITEM15_P237_S0	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_14_ITEM15_P237_S1	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2013, was approximately $222 million to $324 million on an undiscounted basis.
97745_14_ITEM15_P237_S2	The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger.
97745_14_ITEM15_P237_S3	The company s reserve for these matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $179 million at December 31, 2013 (or $224 million undiscounted).
97745_14_ITEM15_P237_S4	The reserve includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $95 million at December 31, 2013 (or $123 million undiscounted).
97745_14_ITEM15_P237_S5	The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger.
97745_14_ITEM15_P237_S6	In addition to the above reserves, as of December 31, 2013, the company had product liability reserves of $9 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.
97745_14_ITEM15_P238_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67%).
97745_14_ITEM15_P238_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $45 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $28 million (net discount $17 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_14_ITEM15_P239_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts reserved and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_14_ITEM15_P240_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_14_ITEM15_P240_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.
97745_14_ITEM15_P240_S2	Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.
97745_14_ITEM15_P241_S0	The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters.
97745_14_ITEM15_P241_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_14_ITEM15_P241_S2	Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of permit requirements and installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented.
97745_14_ITEM15_P241_S3	The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_14_ITEM15_P241_S4	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_14_ITEM15_P241_S5	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_14_ITEM15_P242_S0	Having assumed environmental liabilities in the merger with Fisher, the company was required to discount the estimate of loss to fair (present) value.
97745_14_ITEM15_P242_S1	This fair value was ascribed by using a discount rate of 4.73%, which was the risk free interest rate for monetary assets with maturities comparable to that of the environmental liability.
97745_14_ITEM15_P242_S2	The remaining discount of $5 million is being accreted by charges to interest expense over the estimated maturity period of 30 years.

97745_14_ITEM15_P244_S2	However, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_14_ITEM15_P244_S3	Although these environmental remediation liabilities do not include third-party recoveries, the company may be able to bring indemnification claims against third parties for liabilities relating to certain sites.
97745_14_ITEM15_P245_S0	Comprehensive income combines net income and other comprehensive items.

97745_14_ITEM15_P248_S2	The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.
97745_14_ITEM15_P249_S0	In the event that a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the common stock.
97745_14_ITEM15_P249_S1	In the event that, at any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or more of the company s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common stock.

97745_14_ITEM15_P251_S0	In June 2013, in anticipation of the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into equity forward agreements in connection with a public offering of 29.6 million shares of its common stock.
97745_14_ITEM15_P251_S1	The use of the equity forward agreements substantially eliminated future equity market price risk by fixing a common equity offering sales price under the then existing market conditions, while mitigating share dilution from the offering by postponing the actual issuance of common stock until the funds were needed for the Life Technologies Acquisition.
97745_14_ITEM15_P252_S0	Under the terms of the agreements, the counterparties borrowed shares of the company s common stock and sold them for $85.50 per share.

97745_14_ITEM15_P254_S0	The equity forward and subscription agreements had no initial fair value as they were entered into at the then market price of the common stock.
97745_14_ITEM15_P254_S1	The company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock until the agreements were settled in 2014.
97745_14_ITEM15_P254_S2	Upon settlement, the proceeds were recorded in equity.
97745_14_ITEM15_P254_S3	Prior to their settlement, to the extent that the equity forward agreements were dilutive, they have been reflected in the company s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method.
97745_14_ITEM15_P254_S4	Prior to closing, the subscription agreement was not potentially dilutive to the company s diluted earnings per share calculations due to its contingent nature.

97745_14_ITEM15_P265_S2	The company determines the fair value of the auction rate securities by obtaining indications of value from brokers/dealers.
97745_14_ITEM15_P265_S3	The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on assessment of the probability that the company would be required to make such future payment.

97745_14_ITEM15_P269_S1	The following tables present the fair value of derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of income.
97745_14_ITEM15_P270_S0	(a) The fair value of the interest rate swaps is included in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption other long-term liabilities.

97745_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results.
97745_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve.
97745_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition.
97745_15_ITEM1_P105_S2	Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors.
97745_15_ITEM1_P105_S3	Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development.
97745_15_ITEM1_P105_S4	Our success primarily depends on the following factors:
97745_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	relative prices of our products and services.
97745_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries.
97745_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
97745_15_ITEM1_P107_S2	We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.
97745_15_ITEM1_P107_S3	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.
97745_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws.
97745_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.
97745_15_ITEM1_P109_S0	A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws.
97745_15_ITEM1_P109_S1	Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
97745_15_ITEM1_P110_S0	Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters.
97745_15_ITEM1_P110_S1	Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material.
97745_15_ITEM1_P110_S2	For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.
97745_15_ITEM1_P111_S0	Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program.
97745_15_ITEM1_P111_S1	As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study.
97745_15_ITEM1_P111_S2	In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island.
97745_15_ITEM1_P112_S0	We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_15_ITEM1_P112_S1	We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_15_ITEM1_P112_S2	We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_15_ITEM1_P112_S3	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $32 million at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM1_P113_S0	These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled.
97745_15_ITEM1_P113_S1	We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur.
97745_15_ITEM1_P113_S2	As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM1_P113_S3	However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM1_P114_S0	Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies.
97745_15_ITEM1_P114_S1	As Thermo Fisher s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
97745_15_ITEM1_P114_S2	In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies.
97745_15_ITEM1_P114_S3	While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
97745_15_ITEM1_P114_S4	To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
97745_15_ITEM1_P115_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_15_ITEM1_P115_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_15_ITEM1_P115_S2	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_15_ITEM1_P115_S3	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_15_ITEM1_P116_S0	Financial information about geographic areas is summarized in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.
97745_15_ITEM1_P117_S0	The company files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Exchange Act.
97745_15_ITEM1_P117_S1	The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.

97745_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements beginning on page 4.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
97745_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If the global economy and financial markets, or economic conditions in Europe, the U.S. or other key markets, are unstable, it could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of the company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers, having the effect of:
97745_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	For example, recent developments in Europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	This debt crisis could result in customers in Europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us, or being unable to pay at all.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The continued weakness in world economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain, and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In fiscal year 2013, the U.S. Government was unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, in early 2013, an enforcement mechanism known as sequestration went into effect, which triggered one year of budget reductions.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Despite agreement not to impose similar cuts in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, it is possible that Congress will allow similar cuts to occur again in fiscal year 2016 and beyond.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Unless Congress and the Administration take further action, government funding would be reduced for certain of our customers, including those who are dependent on funding from the National Institutes of Health, which would likely have a significant effect on these entities spending policies.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Integrating the Life Technologies businesses into Thermo Fisher s existing businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be fully realized.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The success of the acquisition of Life Technologies, including the realization of anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of Thermo Fisher and Life Technologies.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The integration may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or the disruption of each company s ongoing businesses or that the alignment of standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect the combined company s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to fully achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	The loss of key employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which Life Technologies operated prior to closing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our common stock.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Other potential difficulties of combining the business of Thermo Fisher and Life Technologies include unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information communications and other systems.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully, or may take longer to realize than expected.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the company.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the functional currency ).
97745_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In 2013, currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $36 million on the revenues of our continuing operations due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services, and in 2014, currency translation had an unfavorable effect on revenues of our continuing operations of $60 million.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	For 2015, the company is expecting a significant negative impact on revenues and operating income due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could have an adverse impact on us.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Some of the potential consequences, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	With our acquisition of Life Technologies, we became party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property (Note 10).
97745_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	If our security products do not operate as designed and fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $18.84 billion and $1.30 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $14.11 billion as of December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P31_S3	We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P35_S4	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability .
97745_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	For example, some of our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In 2012 the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The rule requires an annual disclosure report to be filed, and requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	As our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we undertake, which may harm our reputation.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P41_S6	In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which makes us susceptible to earthquake risk.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $14.56 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In addition, we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The covenants in our revolving credit facility and the term credit facility that we entered into to partially finance the Life Technologies acquisition include a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under either facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under either facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 4.5 to 1.0 until February 2015 and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, by August 2015 or the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense) to be less than 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
97745_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The location and general character of our principal properties by segment are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	We own approximately 2.1 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in California, New York, Maryland and Illinois within the U.S., and in the U.K., Lithuania and New Zealand.

97745_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide.
97745_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses.
97745_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	The company s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.
97745_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as its 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt.
97745_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources .
97745_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Life Technologies was integrated into the Life Sciences Solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing.
97745_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Life Technologies revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	On March 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested.
97745_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net.
97745_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The businesses fell principally in the Life Sciences Solutions segment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	Revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.

97745_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $60 million in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P7_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $549 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_15_ITEM7_P7_S4	Demand from biopharma customers remained strong.
97745_15_ITEM7_P7_S5	Sales to customers in healthcare and industrial markets grew moderately while sales to academic and government markets grew modestly in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P7_S6	Sales growth was strong in Europe and moderate in North America and Asia.
97745_15_ITEM7_P7_S7	Revenues and operating income of the company s non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results.
97745_15_ITEM7_P7_S8	Based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, the company currently expects that there will be a significant adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2015 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.
97745_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	In 2014, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, compared with $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses, inclusion of Life Technologies results from the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	These increases were offset in part by $450 million of charges associated with the acquisition, as discussed below, as well as $569 million of higher amortization expenses, also primarily related to the acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 9.2% and 3.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The 2014 provision for income taxes includes $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S5	The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S6	The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20.1 million, or 1.0 percentage point.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S7	In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15.4 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S8	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $586 million and $230 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S9	The effective tax rate in both periods was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P9_S10	The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The U.S. Congress has not extended the tax credit for research and development activities in 2015 as of February 26, 2015.
97745_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income.
97745_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S.
97745_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	The federal tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points.
97745_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2015 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.
97745_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Income from continuing operations increased to $1.90 billion in 2014, from $1.28 billion in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in operating income in the 2014 period (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in the income tax provision in the 2014 period (discussed above) and an increase in interest expense of $218 million as a result of debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	During 2014, the company s cash flow from operations totaled $2.62 billion compared with $2.01 billion for 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase resulted from cash flow from the acquired Life Technologies operations and a lower investment in working capital items, principally due to income tax refunds and the timing of tax payments, offset in part by cash disbursements totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the company s short-term debt totaled $2.21 billion, including $1.21 billion of senior notes, due in the first half of 2015 and $1.00 billion of minimum payments due in the next twelve months on the company s term loan.
97745_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	In February 2015, the maximum capacity of this facility was increased from $1.50 billion to $2.00 billion.
97745_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	The company believes that its existing cash and short-term investments of $1.35 billion as of December 31, 2014 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	The company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
97745_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, equity investments, sales returns, warranty obligations, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, pension costs and stock-based compensation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
97745_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
97745_15_ITEM7_P17_S5	The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources.
97745_15_ITEM7_P17_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	The company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:
97745_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due.
97745_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Such allowances totaled $74 million at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	If the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
97745_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	The company writes down its inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence based on differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding 12 months, expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
97745_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
97745_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized.
97745_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.
97745_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.81 billion at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
97745_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
97745_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
97745_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $18.84 billion and $1.30 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors.
97745_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	Projections of profitability for 2015 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2014, the date of the company s impairment testing.
97745_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired.
97745_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	Should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
97745_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	With the completion of the Life Technologies acquisition in February 2014, the company established a new segment and reporting unit called Life Sciences Solutions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	This new segment consists of the majority of the former Life Technologies businesses and the remaining Thermo Fisher biosciences businesses following anti-trust required divestitures in March 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	Because this segment consists primarily of the acquired business, the book value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date, the company believes minimal cushion of fair value over book value existed at that date.
97745_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	During its 2014 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the Life Sciences Solutions segment s cushion of fair value over book value had increased to 9% as of October 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	Despite this favorable increase, given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill.
97745_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied.
97745_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable.
97745_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels.
97745_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The Life Sciences Solutions segment had $7.25 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $14.75 billion as of December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	The company reviews other long-lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Other long-lived assets totaled $3.36 billion at December 31, 2014, including $2.43 billion of fixed assets.
97745_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	In testing a long-lived asset for impairment, assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset.
97745_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset-related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts, charges for impairment of other long-lived assets may be necessary.
97745_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes.
97745_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale.
97745_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	Should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company s revenue recognition would be affected.
97745_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
97745_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
97745_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	The company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services, or elements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	The company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for any undelivered elements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	In the event VSOE is not available for any undelivered element, revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of all elements other than post-contract support is completed.
97745_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	Revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.
97745_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	VSOE of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately.
97745_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	Revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed, based on VSOE, which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately.
97745_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers.
97745_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
97745_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	At the time the company recognizes revenue, it provides for the estimated cost of standard product warranties in cost of product revenues based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns.
97745_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The liability for standard warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled $58 million at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	Should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary.
97745_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.
97745_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
97745_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	The company s reserve for these matters totaled $214 million at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P40_S5	Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
97745_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits.
97745_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income.
97745_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance.
97745_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision.
97745_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	The company s tax valuation allowance totaled $116 million at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P43_S4	Should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
97745_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
97745_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes.
97745_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company s tax provision would result.
97745_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
97745_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The accruals are based on management s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates.
97745_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value.
97745_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
97745_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Several of the company s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease.
97745_15_ITEM7_P47_S2	Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels.
97745_15_ITEM7_P47_S3	Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date.
97745_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $56 million in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	The company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $540 million at year-end 2014 (including plan obligations assumed in the acquisition of Life Technologies) compared with $301 million at year-end 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $1 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $108 million.
97745_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the company expects to contribute between $40 and $60 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2015.
97745_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	The fair value of most stock options granted by the company is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	For option grants and restricted stock units that require achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	Management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for determining the expected life of an option.
97745_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	The dividend yield is based on the company s most recent quarterly dividend rate.
97745_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock-based compensation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	The company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures.
97745_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	If actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures, adjustments to compensation expense may be required.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	Sales in 2014 were $16.89 billion, an increase of $3.80 billion from 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	Sales increased $3.31 billion due to acquisitions, net of divestitures.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $60 million in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $549 million (4%) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S4	Demand from biopharma customers remained strong.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S5	Sales to customers in healthcare and industrial markets grew moderately while sales to academic and government markets grew modestly in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S6	Sales growth was strong in Europe and moderate in North America and Asia.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S7	Revenues and operating income of the company s non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results.
97745_15_ITEM7_P55_S8	Based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, the company currently expects that there will be a significant adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2015 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.
97745_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	In 2014, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, compared with $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses, inclusion of Life Technologies results from the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	These increases were offset in part by $450 million of charges associated with the acquisition, as discussed below, as well as $569 million of higher amortization expenses, also primarily related to the acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
97745_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	In 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the Life Technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of Life Technologies.
97745_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	In addition, the company s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia (see Note 14).
97745_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, changes in estimates of contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that were being consolidated.
97745_15_ITEM7_P58_S2	The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2).
97745_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	As of February 26, 2015, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $70 million in 2015 and expects to identify additional actions during 2015 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as abandonment of leased facilities.
97745_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Approximately half of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, with the remainder incurred across the company s remaining segments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2014 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and, to a greater extent, in 2015, including $80 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2013 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $80 million beginning in part in 2013 and to a greater extent in 2014, including $5 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $30 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $25 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income.
97745_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3).
97745_15_ITEM7_P60_S3	Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.
97745_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 45% to $3.69 billion in 2014 due primarily to the acquisition of Life Technologies and to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $3.48 billion to $4.20 billion in 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of Life Technologies, net of divestitures.
97745_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, pro forma revenues for the 2014 period would have decreased $38 million compared to pro forma 2013 revenues, including a decrease of $151 million due to dispositions, net of other acquisitions and a decrease of $45 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $158 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for biosciences and bioprocess production products, offset in part by lower licensing revenues.
97745_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	Operating income margin was 29.0% in 2014 compared to 23.8% in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase resulted primarily from higher operating margins in Life Technologies businesses relative to the segment s legacy operations and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	The company expects the segment s operating income margin in the first quarter of 2015 will be lower than the 29.3% reported in the first quarter of 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	This is due to excluding the results of Life Technologies prior to the February 3, 2014 acquisition date.
97745_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	Results for January commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs.
97745_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $98 million to $3.25 billion in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	Sales increased $113 million (4%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $15 million due to acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease of $30 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments and, to a lesser extent, environmental instruments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	These increases were offset in part by modestly lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain commodity markets such as minerals.
97745_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Operating income margin was 17.9% in 2014 compared to 17.7% in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit from favorable sales mix.
97745_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $152 million to $3.34 billion in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Sales increased $154 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $10 million due to an acquisition net of a divestiture, offset in part by a decrease of $12 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P67_S2	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for immunodiagnostics products, products sold through the segment s healthcare market channel and, to a lesser extent, clinical diagnostics products.
97745_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Operating income margin was 27.4% in 2014 and 27.1% in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase resulted primarily from favorable sales mix and, to a lesser extent, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $203 million to $6.60 billion in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P69_S1	Sales increased $312 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_15_ITEM7_P69_S2	The increase was offset in part by a decrease of $93 million due to dispositions and $17 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P69_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial logistics services.
97745_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Operating income margin was 14.9% in 2014 and 15.0% in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	The company reported other expense, net, of $416 million and $290 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively (Note 4).
97745_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	Interest expense increased $218 million primarily due to the debt issued and assumed in connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	In 2014, the company realized net gains of $9 million from equity and available-for-sale investments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	In 2013, the company recorded $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	Also in 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 9.2% and 3.1% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	The 2014 provision for income taxes includes $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S3	In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S4	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S5	The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S6	The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20.1 million, or 1.0 percentage point.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S7	In 2014, the company recognized a discrete tax benefit of $15.4 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S8	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $586 million and $230 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S9	The effective tax rate in both periods was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P72_S10	The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	The U.S. Congress has not extended the tax credit for research and development activities in 2015 as of February 26, 2015.
97745_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income.
97745_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $104 million and reduced the company s effective tax rate by 7.9 percentage points in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P74_S3	In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S.
97745_15_ITEM7_P74_S4	The federal tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points.
97745_15_ITEM7_P74_S5	The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2015 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business.
97745_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S.
97745_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	All of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the U.S.
97745_15_ITEM7_P76_S2	The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
97745_15_ITEM7_P76_S3	The company s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries.
97745_15_ITEM7_P76_S4	Based on the dispersion of the company s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.
97745_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	In June 2012, in an effort to exit a non-core business, the company pursued a sale of its laboratory workstations business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	The company completed the sale in October 2012 for nominal proceeds.
97745_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	In 2013, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $4.2 million for the estimated cost to raze certain abandoned facilities of the discontinued operations prior to the planned sale of the land.
97745_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP.
97745_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	As a result, items that are both unusual and infrequent will no longer be separately reported net of tax after continuing operations.
97745_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015.
97745_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.
97745_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
97745_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	The guidance is effective for the company in 2017.
97745_15_ITEM7_P79_S3	The company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals.
97745_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations.
97745_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of the company that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting.
97745_15_ITEM7_P80_S3	The company adopted this guidance effective January 2015.
97745_15_ITEM7_P80_S4	The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters.
97745_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters and Intellectual Property Matters in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Sales in 2013 were $13.09 billion, an increase of $580 million from 2012.
97745_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	Sales increased $188 million due to acquisitions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $36 million in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P82_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $429 million (3%) primarily due to increased demand offset in part by modestly lower sales to customers in academic and government markets which the company believes was due in part to uncertainty in government funding expectations in the U.S. Sales remained strong to customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries while sales growth was modest to customers in industrial markets.
97745_15_ITEM7_P82_S4	Sales growth was strong in Asia and modest in Europe and North America.
97745_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	In 2013, total company operating income and operating income margin were $1.61 billion and 12.3%, respectively, compared with $1.48 billion and 11.8%, respectively, in 2012.
97745_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	The increase was offset in part by strategic growth investments, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, $24 million of higher acquisition-related charges in 2013, an increase in amortization expense of $16 million in 2013 primarily related to the acquisitions of One Lambda and Doe Ingalls and imposition of a medical device excise tax in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	In 2013, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $180 million, including $29 million of charges to cost of revenues related primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $74 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, revisions of estimated contingent consideration for an acquisition and a charge associated with product liability litigation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The company incurred $78 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, such as the consolidation of several facilities in the U.S. and Europe (see Note 14).
97745_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	The cash costs also included $4 million of transaction expenses related to the agreement to sell its sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses (see Note 2).
97745_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	In 2012, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $150 million, including $56 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and $13 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consisting of transaction costs related to the acquisition of One Lambda.

97745_15_ITEM7_P85_S2	The company also recorded $15 million of non-cash expense, net, primarily for the impairment of intangible asset at several small business units and, to a lesser extent, real estate writedowns related to facility consolidations partially offset by a $6 million gain from the settlement of pre-acquisition litigation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2012 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $85 million beginning in part in 2012 and to a greater extent in 2013, including $10 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $20 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $30 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 7% to $2.55 billion in 2013 due primarily to productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on incremental sales from acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
97745_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $54 million to $713 million in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Sales increased $55 million (8%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses offset in part by a decrease of $1 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioscience products.
97745_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Operating income margin was 23.8% in 2013 compared to 23.5% in 2012.
97745_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Operating margin was favorably affected by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments.
97745_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $40 million to $3.15 billion in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Sales increased $53 million (2%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $9 million due to acquisitions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $23 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments, offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products which the company believes were affected by macro economic conditions facing customers in industrial markets.
97745_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Operating income margin was 17.7% in 2013 compared to 17.8% in 2012.
97745_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	Operating margin was unfavorably affected by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $230 million to $3.19 billion in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P92_S1	Sales increased $143 million due to an acquisition and $93 million (3%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_15_ITEM7_P92_S2	These increases were offset in part by a decrease of $5 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_15_ITEM7_P92_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand, particularly for clinical diagnostics products and, to a lesser extent, microbiology and allergy products in part as a result of strong flu and pollen seasons, partially offset by weakness from reduced healthcare utilization and lower sales of instruments to diagnostic laboratories due in part to lower healthcare reimbursement rates in the U.S. for anatomical pathology tests.
97745_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	Operating income margin was 27.1% in 2013 and 25.6% in 2012.
97745_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	The increase resulted from profit on incremental sales from an acquisition and, to a lesser extent, at existing businesses as well as productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	The increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and imposition of the medical device excise tax in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM7_P94_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $296 million to $6.40 billion in 2013.

97745_15_ITEM7_P94_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for laboratory products and clinical trial logistics services.
97745_15_ITEM7_P94_S4	Sales of laboratory equipment increased only modestly due to weakness in demand from customers in academic and government markets.
97745_15_ITEM7_P95_S0	Operating income margin was 15.0% in both 2013 and 2012.
97745_15_ITEM7_P95_S1	Productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, price increases were offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.

97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S0	The company s effective tax rates were 3.1% and 0.9% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S1	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization, the company s cash payments (net of refunds) for income taxes for its continuing operations were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $230 million and $331 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S2	Tax payments decreased in 2013 due primarily to refunds of taxes paid in 2012.
97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S3	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the U.S. which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S4	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million offset by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income.

97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S6	In addition, the effective tax rate in 2013 was also reduced by the U.S. Congress renewal in January 2013 of a tax credit for research and development activities for 2012 and 2013 and, to a lesser extent, increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions and financing costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies that are deductible in the U.S.
97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S7	The tax credit for 2012 and 2013 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2013 by $15.4 million, or 1.2 percentage points.
97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S8	The tax provision in the 2013 period was unfavorably affected by $5.4 million, or 0.4 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates and audit settlements.
97745_15_ITEM7_P98_S9	The tax provision in 2012 was favorably affected by $53 million, or 4.1 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates, particularly a lower tax rate in Sweden.

97745_15_ITEM7_P99_S3	The business incurred a pre-tax loss of $30 million in 2012 in part due to inventory write-offs, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and other transition costs associated with relocation of the business.
97745_15_ITEM7_P99_S4	In 2012, the company recorded after-tax charges aggregating $63 million as the loss on the divestiture.
97745_15_ITEM7_P99_S5	The loss in 2013 for discontinued operations primarily represents a charge for the cost of razing abandoned facilities of the business prior to sale of the land.
97745_15_ITEM7_P100_S0	Consolidated working capital was $1.19 billion at December 31, 2014, compared with $6.75 billion at December 31, 2013.

97745_15_ITEM7_P123_S1	The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.
97745_15_ITEM7_P123_S2	However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM7_P124_S0	The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities.
97745_15_ITEM7_P124_S1	Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition.

97745_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen, Norwegian kroner and Swedish kronor.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents.

97745_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The fair market value of the company s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The total estimated fair value of the company s debt at December 31, 2014 was $14.89 billion (see Note 12).
97745_15_ITEM7A_P2_S5	Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P2_S6	If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company s debt at December 31, 2014 would increase by approximately $683 million.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P2_S7	If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company s debt at December 31, 2014 would decrease by approximately $629 million.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including a term loan agreement and swap arrangements.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In 2014, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the term loan and swap arrangements would have increased the company s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $35 million.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The company s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The functional currencies of the company s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Danish kroner and Canadian dollars.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P4_S4	The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P4_S5	A 10% depreciation in year-end 2014 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $1.04 billion.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A 10% depreciation in year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $110 million.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	A 10% appreciation in year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $110 million.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Certain of the company s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2014 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $23 million on the company s net income.

97745_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	The company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest expense) as the offsetting effective portion of the loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.
97745_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
97745_15_ITEM15_P96_S1	In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets and in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets (Note 2) and the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14).
97745_15_ITEM15_P96_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P97_S0	In January 2015, the FASB issued new guidance to simplify income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items from U.S. GAAP.

97745_15_ITEM15_P98_S1	The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
97745_15_ITEM15_P98_S2	The guidance is effective for the company in 2017.
97745_15_ITEM15_P98_S3	The company is currently evaluating the impact the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P99_S0	In April 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals.
97745_15_ITEM15_P99_S1	Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations will be presented as discontinued operations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P99_S2	The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of the company that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting.

97745_15_ITEM15_P99_S4	The adoption of this standard in 2015 is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	The company s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses.
97745_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products.
97745_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

97745_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt.
97745_15_ITEM15_P102_S1	The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition (Notes 9 and 11).
97745_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	Life Technologies provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing.

97745_15_ITEM15_P109_S6	The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $274 million was allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.
97745_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	In May 2012, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Doe Ingalls Management, LLC, a North Carolina-based channel for specialty production chemicals and provider of customized supply-chain services to the life sciences and microelectronics industries, for $175 million.

97745_15_ITEM15_P115_S2	Immediately upon the closing of the acquisition, the company began integrating Life Technologies and as such the legacy and acquired businesses are now sharing various selling, general and administrative functions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P115_S3	As a result, computing a separate measure of Life Technologies stand-alone profitability for periods after the acquisition date is not practical.
97745_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed as of the beginning of 2013, the company s pro forma results for 2014 and 2013 would have been as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	Pro forma results include non-recurring pro forma adjustments that were directly attributable to the business combination to reflect amounts as if the acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of 2013, as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	Pre-tax reduction of revenues of $ 8.1 million and $ 23.9 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, for revaluing Life Technologies deferred revenue obligations to fair value.
97745_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	These pro forma results of operations have been prepared for comparative purposes only, and they do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the acquisition occurred on the date indicated or that may result in the future.
97745_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	The company s results would not have been materially different from its pro forma results had the company s other 2014 acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2013.
97745_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	On August 15, 2014, the company sold its Cole-Parmer specialty channel business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested.
97745_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net.
97745_15_ITEM15_P121_S2	Due to the low tax basis in the Cole-Parmer business, the tax provision related to the sale slightly exceeded the pre-tax gain, resulting in a $ 4 million after-tax loss on the sale of the business.
97745_15_ITEM15_P121_S3	Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.

97745_15_ITEM15_P123_S2	Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM15_P123_S3	Revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.
97745_15_ITEM15_P123_S4	The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net.
97745_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	The assets and liabilities of the businesses sold in March 2014 were as follows at December 31, 2013:
97745_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	In October 2012, the company sold its laboratory workstations business (see Note 15).
97745_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	The company s financial performance is reported in four segments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P126_S1	A description of each segment follows.
97745_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	Life Sciences Solutions: provides an extensive portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines as well as diagnosis of disease.
97745_15_ITEM15_P127_S1	These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, clinical, academic, and government markets.
97745_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	Analytical Instruments: provides a broad offering of instruments, consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory, on the production line and in the field.
97745_15_ITEM15_P128_S1	These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.
97745_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	Specialty Diagnostics: provides a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses.
97745_15_ITEM15_P129_S1	These products are used by customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial and food safety laboratories.
97745_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	Laboratory Products and Services: provides virtually everything needed for the laboratory, including a combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and an extensive service offering.
97745_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.
97745_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.
97745_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	(a) Represents operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring and other costs, net; and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.
97745_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	The company does not allocate other expense, net to its segments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, property and equipment at the company's corporate offices and assets of the discontinued operations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	Revenues are attributed to countries based on customer location.
97745_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	Includes property, plant and equipment, net.
97745_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	The components of other expense, net, in the accompanying statement of income are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	In 2014, other items, net includes $9 million of net gains from equity and available-for-sale investments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	In 2013, other items, net includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies acquisition offset in part by $5 million of gains from sales of equity investments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	Additionally, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others.
97745_15_ITEM15_P140_S1	These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer.
97745_15_ITEM15_P140_S2	The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings.
97745_15_ITEM15_P140_S3	Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
97745_15_ITEM15_P141_S0	Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.
97745_15_ITEM15_P142_S0	The components of stock-based compensation expense are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P143_S0	Certain pre-acquisition equity awards of Life Technologies were converted to rights to receive future cash payments over the remaining vesting period.
97745_15_ITEM15_P143_S1	In addition to stock-based compensation, which is included in the above table, in 2014, the company recorded expense for cash-in-lieu of equity of $ 34.8 million related to these arrangements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P144_S0	The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company.
97745_15_ITEM15_P145_S0	The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P145_S1	The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes.
97745_15_ITEM15_P145_S2	Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value on the accompanying balance sheet were $65.4 million, $46.6 million and $18.7 million, respectively, in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
97745_15_ITEM15_P146_S0	The company s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value.
97745_15_ITEM15_P146_S1	Options vest over 3-5 years with terms of 7-10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P146_S2	Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P147_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_15_ITEM15_P147_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_15_ITEM15_P147_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_15_ITEM15_P148_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_15_ITEM15_P149_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P149_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option.
97745_15_ITEM15_P149_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_15_ITEM15_P149_S3	The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.
97745_15_ITEM15_P150_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_15_ITEM15_P151_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_15_ITEM15_P152_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P153_S0	A summary of the company s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is presented below:
97745_15_ITEM15_P154_S0	As of December 31, 2014, there was $77 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted.
97745_15_ITEM15_P154_S1	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2018 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.5 years.
97745_15_ITEM15_P155_S0	Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P155_S1	The awards generally vest over 3-4 years, assuming continued employment, with some exceptions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P155_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P155_S3	The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_15_ITEM15_P155_S4	Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents.
97745_15_ITEM15_P155_S5	The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.
97745_15_ITEM15_P155_S6	For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.
97745_15_ITEM15_P156_S0	A summary of the company s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 is presented below:
97745_15_ITEM15_P157_S0	As of December 31, 2014, there was $101 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock unit awards.
97745_15_ITEM15_P157_S1	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2018 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years.
97745_15_ITEM15_P158_S0	Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company.
97745_15_ITEM15_P158_S1	Shares may be purchased under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period.
97745_15_ITEM15_P158_S2	Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee s gross wages.
97745_15_ITEM15_P158_S3	The company issued 119,000, 100,000 and 151,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2014, 2013 and 2012 plan years, which ended on December 31.
97745_15_ITEM15_P159_S0	The company s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees.
97745_15_ITEM15_P159_S1	Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company.
97745_15_ITEM15_P159_S2	Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P159_S3	Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company.
97745_15_ITEM15_P159_S4	In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company charged to expense $118.4 million, $87.3 million and $86.0 million, respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.
97745_15_ITEM15_P160_S0	Employees of a number of the company s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries.
97745_15_ITEM15_P160_S1	Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws.
97745_15_ITEM15_P160_S2	The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate.
97745_15_ITEM15_P160_S3	The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.
97745_15_ITEM15_P161_S0	The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability.
97745_15_ITEM15_P161_S1	This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.
97745_15_ITEM15_P161_S2	The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_15_ITEM15_P161_S3	Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_15_ITEM15_P162_S0	When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset.
97745_15_ITEM15_P162_S1	The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.
97745_15_ITEM15_P163_S0	The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.
97745_15_ITEM15_P163_S1	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company made cash contributions of approximately $49.6 million, $38.2 million and $23.3 million, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM15_P163_S2	Additionally, in 2013 the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans.
97745_15_ITEM15_P163_S3	Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $40 and $60 million for 2015.
97745_15_ITEM15_P164_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the company s domestic and non-U.S. pension plans and postretirement benefit plans:
97745_15_ITEM15_P165_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 and are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P166_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table:
97745_15_ITEM15_P167_S0	The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2015 and 2033.
97745_15_ITEM15_P168_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P168_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_15_ITEM15_P169_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P169_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_15_ITEM15_P169_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_15_ITEM15_P170_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P171_S0	The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management s expectations of future salary increases.
97745_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2015 are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	The net periodic pension benefit cost (income) includes the following components:
97745_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	The net periodic postretirement benefit cost was not material in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
97745_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	The company offered to settle pension obligations for former employee participants in certain defined benefit plans in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P178_S1	The company recorded a charge of $29.6 million associated with those plan participants electing to accept the settlement offer.
97745_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P179_S1	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P179_S2	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P180_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2014 would change the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2014 and the 2014 aggregate of service and interest costs, as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P181_S0	The company s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P181_S1	The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility.
97745_15_ITEM15_P181_S2	The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities.
97745_15_ITEM15_P181_S3	The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 1% of invested assets) of private equity investments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P181_S4	The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 28% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately 2% to real estate-related equities, approximately 24% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 47% to funds investing in fixed income securities.
97745_15_ITEM15_P181_S5	The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P182_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_15_ITEM15_P182_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_15_ITEM15_P182_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_15_ITEM15_P183_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_15_ITEM15_P183_S1	For plans not currently managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 35% - 70% for equities and 30% - 65% for fixed income securities.
97745_15_ITEM15_P183_S2	For plans managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments also include hedge funds, multi-asset funds and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 3% - 10% for equities, 45% - 65% for fixed income, 10% - 20% for hedge funds, 4% - 5% for multi-asset funds and 18% - 22% for funds holding derivatives.
97745_15_ITEM15_P183_S3	The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P183_S4	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P184_S0	The fair values of the company s plan assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013, by asset category are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P185_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12).
97745_15_ITEM15_P185_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P186_S0	The fair value of the company s private equity investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds.
97745_15_ITEM15_P187_S0	There was no significant activity within the Level 3 pension plan assets during the years presented.
97745_15_ITEM15_P188_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P189_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P190_S0	The income tax provision (benefit) included in the accompanying statement of income is as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P191_S0	The company receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_15_ITEM15_P191_S1	The provision for income taxes that is currently payable does not reflect $65.4 million, $46.6 million and $18.7 million of such benefits that have been allocated to capital in excess of par value in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM15_P192_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_15_ITEM15_P193_S0	The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives.
97745_15_ITEM15_P193_S1	The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore.
97745_15_ITEM15_P193_S2	This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2021.
97745_15_ITEM15_P193_S3	The impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rate by 1.6% and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.08 in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P194_S0	In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM15_P194_S1	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P194_S2	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM15_P194_S3	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM15_P194_S4	In addition, the impact of tax law changes in certain foreign jurisdictions reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2013.
97745_15_ITEM15_P194_S5	The impact of change in tax laws and apportionment on deferred taxes in 2012 includes $55 million of benefit from a tax rate reduction enacted in Sweden.
97745_15_ITEM15_P195_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_15_ITEM15_P196_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized.
97745_15_ITEM15_P196_S1	At December 31, 2014, all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_15_ITEM15_P197_S0	At December 31, 2014, the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $131.5 million, $830.3 million and $2.61 billion, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM15_P198_S0	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_15_ITEM15_P198_S1	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2015 through 2034.
97745_15_ITEM15_P198_S2	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $277.5 million expire in the years 2015 through 2033, and the remainder do not expire.
97745_15_ITEM15_P198_S3	The company also had $209.3 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2014, which expire in the years 2015 through 2024.
97745_15_ITEM15_P199_S0	A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $8.44 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost.
97745_15_ITEM15_P199_S1	It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized tax liability due to i) the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used (among several possibilities) should a decision be made to repatriate; ii) the availability and the complexity of calculating foreign tax credits; and iii) the implications of indirect taxes, including withholding taxes that could potentially be required depending on the repatriation structure.
97745_15_ITEM15_P200_S0	As of December 31, 2014, the company had $214.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_15_ITEM15_P201_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P202_S0	During 2014, the company acquired Life Technologies which resulted in an increase in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $54.3 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P202_S1	The liability also increased due to the provision of tax reserves, primarily related to the sale of the divested businesses and a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction.
97745_15_ITEM15_P202_S2	During 2014, the company settled the IRS audit relating to the 2010 and 2011 tax years which resulted in a decrease in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $48.0 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P202_S3	Of the total $214 million of liability, $7 million is classified as a current liability and the remainder is long-term.
97745_15_ITEM15_P203_S0	During 2013, the company settled the IRS audit relating to the 2008 and 2009 tax years which resulted in a decrease in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $8.9 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P203_S1	The liability was also reduced by $21.0 million due to the company s withdrawal of a U.S. court case relating to the 2001 to 2003 tax years.
97745_15_ITEM15_P203_S2	Additionally, in 2013, the company benefited from a favorable resolution of a court case in Sweden which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $21.1 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P203_S3	Of the total $21.1 million, $16.9 million reduced income tax expense.
97745_15_ITEM15_P204_S0	During 2012, the statute of limitations on certain unrecognized tax benefits lapsed which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $7.8 million, all of which reduced income tax expense.
97745_15_ITEM15_P205_S0	The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
97745_15_ITEM15_P205_S1	The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $15.5 million and $14.1 million, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM15_P206_S0	The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P206_S1	In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
97745_15_ITEM15_P206_S2	With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2010.
97745_15_ITEM15_P207_S0	Options to purchase 2.4 million, 1.0 million and 7.2 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive.
97745_15_ITEM15_P208_S0	The effective interest rates for the fixed-rate debt include the stated interest on the notes, the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.
97745_15_ITEM15_P209_S0	See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company s long-term obligations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P210_S0	The annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P211_S0	As of December 31, 2013, short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $280.0 million of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company s subsidiaries.
97745_15_ITEM15_P211_S1	The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 0.58% at December 31, 2013.
97745_15_ITEM15_P211_S2	The company had no outstanding short-term borrowings at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P211_S3	In addition to available borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $107.7 million as of December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P211_S4	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P212_S0	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_15_ITEM15_P212_S1	In February 2015, the maximum capacity of this facility was increased from $1.50 billion to $2.00 billion.
97745_15_ITEM15_P212_S2	The facility expires in July 2018.
97745_15_ITEM15_P212_S3	The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_15_ITEM15_P212_S4	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_15_ITEM15_P212_S5	The financial covenant requires the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) below 4.5 to 1.0 until February 2015 and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, by August 2015 and an Interest Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) to interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_15_ITEM15_P213_S0	The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes.
97745_15_ITEM15_P213_S1	The credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
97745_15_ITEM15_P213_S2	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_15_ITEM15_P213_S3	As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_15_ITEM15_P214_S0	The company has a U.S. commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes).
97745_15_ITEM15_P214_S1	Maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the CP Notes rank pari passu with all of the company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
97745_15_ITEM15_P214_S2	CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment.
97745_15_ITEM15_P215_S0	CP Notes are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
97745_15_ITEM15_P215_S1	As of December 31, 2014, no borrowings were outstanding under this program.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S0	In connection with the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into an unsecured term loan agreement.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S1	The term loan agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S2	The term loan agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S3	The financial covenants require the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) below 4.5 to 1.0 until February 2015 and decreasing, based on the passage of time, to 3.5 to 1.0, by August 2015.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S4	The company must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S5	As of December 31, 2014, outstanding borrowings under the term loan agreement were $1.28 billion.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S6	The company is required to make minimum periodic payments through March 2016.
97745_15_ITEM15_P216_S7	Borrowings may be prepaid without penalty.
97745_15_ITEM15_P217_S0	Interest on the euro-denominated 2.00% Senior Notes due 2025 is payable annually.
97745_15_ITEM15_P217_S1	Interest on each of the other senior notes is payable semi-annually.
97745_15_ITEM15_P217_S2	Each of the notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest.
97745_15_ITEM15_P218_S0	The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P219_S0	The 4.40% Senior Notes due 2015, 3.50% Senior Notes due 2016, 6.00% Senior Notes due 2020 and 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021 were assumed by the company in connection with the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM15_P219_S1	The fair value of these senior notes on the date of acquisition exceeded the par value by $207 million which was recorded as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt and will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective debt instruments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P219_S2	This adjustment does not affect cash interest payments.
97745_15_ITEM15_P220_S0	In 2013, upon the issuance of $ 900 million principal amount of 1.30% Senior Notes due 2017, the company entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks.
97745_15_ITEM15_P220_S1	The aggregate amount of the swaps is equal to the principal amount of the 1.30% Notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the payment dates of the 1.30% Notes.
97745_15_ITEM15_P220_S2	The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 0.6616% ( 0.8166% at December 31, 2014) and to receive a fixed rate of 1.30%.
97745_15_ITEM15_P220_S3	The variable interest rate resets monthly.
97745_15_ITEM15_P220_S4	The swaps have been accounted for as a fair value hedge of the 1.30% Notes.
97745_15_ITEM15_P220_S5	See Note 12 for additional information.
97745_15_ITEM15_P221_S0	In 2013, prior to issuing the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering.
97745_15_ITEM15_P221_S1	Based on the company s conclusion that a debt offering was probable as a result of near-term debt maturities and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10-year term, the swaps hedged the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $700 million of principal amount of the planned 10-year fixed-rate debt issue.
97745_15_ITEM15_P221_S2	In December 2013, the company issued senior notes and terminated the swap arrangements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P221_S3	The company received $11 million at the termination of these agreements and recorded a gain of $1 million on the ineffective portion in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income.
97745_15_ITEM15_P221_S4	The remaining favorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination (the effective portion) was $6 million, net of tax, and was classified as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholder s equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2024.
97745_15_ITEM15_P222_S0	The company leases certain logistics, office, and manufacturing facilities.
97745_15_ITEM15_P222_S1	Income from continuing operations includes expense from operating leases of $181.1 million, $127.9 million and $125.5 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM15_P222_S2	The following is a summary of annual future minimum lease and rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2014:
97745_15_ITEM15_P223_S0	The company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
97745_15_ITEM15_P223_S1	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.
97745_15_ITEM15_P223_S2	The aggregate amount of the company s unconditional purchase obligations totaled $357.8 million at December 31, 2014 and the majority of these obligations are expected to be settled during 2015.
97745_15_ITEM15_P224_S0	Outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled $139.6 million at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P224_S1	Substantially all of these letters of credit and guarantees expire before 2020.
97745_15_ITEM15_P225_S0	Outstanding surety bonds and other guarantees totaled $45.9 million at December 31, 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P225_S1	The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2016.
97745_15_ITEM15_P226_S0	The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required.
97745_15_ITEM15_P226_S1	The outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds disclosed above include $32.1 million for businesses that have been sold.
97745_15_ITEM15_P227_S0	The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business.
97745_15_ITEM15_P227_S1	The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so.
97745_15_ITEM15_P227_S2	The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2014 was $49 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P228_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_15_ITEM15_P228_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P228_S2	However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.
97745_15_ITEM15_P229_S0	The company has funding commitments totaling $5.4 million at December 31, 2014, related to investments it owns.
97745_15_ITEM15_P230_S0	In 2012, the company entered into an off-balance sheet build-to-suit financing arrangement with a financial institution to fund construction of an operating facility in the U.S. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease commenced with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms.
97745_15_ITEM15_P230_S1	The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 9), and has guaranteed the facility s residual value at the end of the lease, up to a maximum of $58 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P231_S0	In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities).
97745_15_ITEM15_P231_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_15_ITEM15_P231_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_15_ITEM15_P232_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_15_ITEM15_P232_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_15_ITEM15_P233_S0	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_15_ITEM15_P233_S1	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_15_ITEM15_P233_S2	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_15_ITEM15_P234_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.
97745_15_ITEM15_P235_S0	In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
97745_15_ITEM15_P235_S1	The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S0	The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S2	Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S3	The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S4	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S5	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S6	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the company s total environmental liability was approximately $32 million and $29 million, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM15_P236_S7	While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM15_P237_S0	There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment, and contractual issues.
97745_15_ITEM15_P237_S1	The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters.
97745_15_ITEM15_P237_S2	A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S1	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S2	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S3	Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S4	The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S5	Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, and, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S6	The company has no material accruals for matters discussed below for which accrual amounts are not disclosed, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters.
97745_15_ITEM15_P238_S7	It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
97745_15_ITEM15_P239_S0	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2014, was approximately $226 million to $351 million on an undiscounted basis.
97745_15_ITEM15_P239_S1	The portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger.
97745_15_ITEM15_P239_S2	The company s accrual for all such matters in total, including the discounted liabilities, was $186 million at December 31, 2014 (or $226 million undiscounted).
97745_15_ITEM15_P239_S3	The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $93 million at December 31, 2014 (or $118 million undiscounted).
97745_15_ITEM15_P239_S4	The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger.
97745_15_ITEM15_P239_S5	In addition to the above accrual, as of December 31, 2014, the company had a product liability accrual of $9 million (undiscounted) relating to divested businesses.
97745_15_ITEM15_P240_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67%).
97745_15_ITEM15_P240_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $40 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $25 million (net discount $15 million) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_15_ITEM15_P241_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_15_ITEM15_P242_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_15_ITEM15_P242_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.
97745_15_ITEM15_P242_S2	Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.
97745_15_ITEM15_P243_S0	On February 3, 2014, the company acquired Life Technologies.

97745_15_ITEM15_P247_S3	Although a jury initially found willful infringement and assessed damages at $ 52 million, the District Court subsequently overturned the verdict on the grounds that the plaintiff had failed to prove infringement.
97745_15_ITEM15_P248_S0	The District Court entered judgment in favor of Life Technologies; and plaintiffs and Life Technologies filed cross-appeals with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
97745_15_ITEM15_P248_S1	The $ 52 million award was accrued by Life Technologies and the liability was assumed by the company as of the date of the acquisition.

97745_15_ITEM15_P255_S0	Comprehensive income (loss) combines net income and other comprehensive items.
97745_15_ITEM15_P255_S1	Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders equity in the accompanying balance sheet.
97745_15_ITEM15_P256_S0	Changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net of tax are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P257_S0	The amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive items are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P258_S0	At December 31, 2014, the company had reserved 39.6 million unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans.
97745_15_ITEM15_P259_S0	The company has 50,000 shares of authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P260_S0	The company has distributed rights under a shareholder rights plan adopted by the company s Board of Directors to holders of outstanding shares of the company s common stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P260_S1	Each right entitles the holder to purchase one hundred-thousandth of a share (a Unit) of Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock, $100 par value, at a purchase price of $200 per Unit, subject to adjustment.
97745_15_ITEM15_P260_S2	The rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons (an Acquiring Person) has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock (the Stock Acquisition Date), or (ii) 10 business days following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P261_S0	In the event that a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, except pursuant to an offer for all outstanding shares of common stock that at least 75% of the Board of Directors determines to be fair to, and otherwise in the best interests of, stockholders, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, that number of shares of common stock (or, in certain circumstances, units of preferred stock, cash, property or other securities of the company) which equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the common stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P261_S1	In the event that, at any time after any person has become an Acquiring Person, (i) the company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction in which the company is not the surviving corporation or its common stock is changed or exchanged (other than a merger that follows an offer approved by the Board of Directors), or (ii) 50% or more of the company s assets or earning power is sold or transferred, each holder of a right (except for the Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise, the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that equals the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P262_S0	At any time until the Stock Acquisition Date, the company may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right (payable in cash or stock).
97745_15_ITEM15_P262_S1	The rights expire on September 29, 2015, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.
97745_15_ITEM15_P263_S0	In June 2013, in anticipation of the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into equity forward agreements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P263_S1	The use of the equity forward agreements substantially eliminated future equity market price risk by fixing a common equity offering sales price under the then existing market conditions, while mitigating share dilution from the offering by postponing the actual issuance of common stock until the funds were needed for the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM15_P264_S0	Upon settlement of the agreements, in January 2014, the company issued and delivered 29.6 million shares of its common stock at the then applicable forward sale price of $82.5342 per share.
97745_15_ITEM15_P265_S0	On February 3, 2014, the company issued 5.3 million shares of its common stock at a price of $ 94.85 per share to settle a private placement subscription agreement that was contingent on the closing of the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_15_ITEM15_P266_S0	The equity forward and subscription agreements had no initial fair value as they were entered into at the then market price of the common stock.
97745_15_ITEM15_P266_S1	The company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock until the agreements were settled.
97745_15_ITEM15_P266_S2	Upon settlement, the proceeds were recorded in equity.
97745_15_ITEM15_P266_S3	Prior to their settlement, to the extent that the equity forward agreements were dilutive, they have been reflected in the company s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method.
97745_15_ITEM15_P266_S4	Prior to closing, the subscription agreement was not potentially dilutive to the company s diluted earnings per share calculations due to its contingent nature.
97745_15_ITEM15_P267_S0	The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P268_S0	The company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of investments in money market funds; derivative contracts, insurance contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration.
97745_15_ITEM15_P269_S0	The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
97745_15_ITEM15_P270_S0	Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
97745_15_ITEM15_P271_S0	Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.
97745_15_ITEM15_P272_S0	Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.
97745_15_ITEM15_P273_S0	The following table presents information about the company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014:
97745_15_ITEM15_P274_S0	The following table presents information about the company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013:
97745_15_ITEM15_P275_S0	Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value and are included in the tables above.
97745_15_ITEM15_P275_S1	The aggregate market value, cost basis and gross unrealized gains and losses of available-for-sale investments by major security type are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P276_S0	The cost of available-for-sale investments that were sold was based on specific identification in determining realized gains and losses recorded in the accompanying statement of income.
97745_15_ITEM15_P276_S1	In 2013, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P276_S2	Gross realized gains on the sale of available-for-sale investments were $2 million in 2014 and nominal in 2013 and 2012.
97745_15_ITEM15_P276_S3	Gross realized losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments were nominal in 2014, 2013 and 2012.
97745_15_ITEM15_P277_S0	The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer.
97745_15_ITEM15_P277_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P277_S2	The company determined the fair value of the auction rate securities by obtaining indications of value from brokers/dealers.
97745_15_ITEM15_P277_S3	The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on assessment of the probability that the company would be required to make such future payment.
97745_15_ITEM15_P277_S4	Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.
97745_15_ITEM15_P278_S0	In the second quarter of 2014, the company sold all of its auction rate securities and realized a net gain of $1.4 million.
97745_15_ITEM15_P279_S0	There was no significant activity within the auction rate securities during 2013.
97745_15_ITEM15_P280_S0	The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by Level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration.
97745_15_ITEM15_P281_S0	The notional amounts of derivative contracts outstanding, consisting of currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, totaled $3.74 billion and $2.03 billion at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.
97745_15_ITEM15_P282_S0	While certain derivatives are subject to netting arrangements with counterparties, the company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet.
97745_15_ITEM15_P282_S1	The following tables present the fair value of derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of income.
97745_15_ITEM15_P283_S0	The fair value of the interest rate swaps is included in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption other long-term liabilities.
97745_15_ITEM15_P284_S0	The fair value of the currency exchange contracts is included in the consolidated balance sheet under the captions other current assets or other accrued expenses.
97745_15_ITEM15_P285_S0	Gains and losses recognized on currency exchange contracts and the effective portion of interest rate swaps are included in the consolidated statement of income together with the corresponding, offsetting losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions.
97745_15_ITEM15_P285_S1	Gains and losses recognized on the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are included in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income.
97745_15_ITEM15_P286_S0	The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
97745_15_ITEM15_P286_S1	The company s euro-denominated 2.00% Senior Notes, due 2025, have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation.
97745_15_ITEM15_P286_S2	Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income and shareholders equity.
97745_15_ITEM15_P286_S3	In 2014, the cumulative translation adjustment includes pre-tax net gains of $ 20.9 million from the euro-denominated notes.
97745_15_ITEM15_P287_S0	The carrying value and fair value of the company s notes receivable and debt obligations are as follows:
97745_15_ITEM15_P288_S0	The fair value of debt obligations was determined based on quoted market prices and on borrowing rates available to the company at the respective period ends which represent level 2 measurements.
97745_15_ITEM15_P289_S0	Restructuring and other costs (income) in 2014 primarily included the gains on sale of the company s sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses and the sale of the Cole-Parmer business, and to a lesser extent gains on the sale of real estate, offset in part by sales of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition, third-party acquisition transaction and integration costs, severance obligations payable to former Life Technologies executives and employees, charges to conform the accounting policies of Life Technologies with the company s accounting policies and, to a lesser extent, continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
97745_15_ITEM15_P289_S1	In 2014, severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 3% of the company s workforce.
97745_15_ITEM15_P289_S2	The company also incurred charges for pension settlements in 2014.
97745_15_ITEM15_P290_S0	Restructuring and other costs in 2013 and 2012 primarily included continuing charges for headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including the closure and consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
97745_15_ITEM15_P290_S1	The company s 2013 and 2012 severance actions associated with facility consolidations and cost reduction measures affected approximately 3% of the company s workforce in both years.
97745_15_ITEM15_P291_S0	As of February 26, 2015, the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $70 million, primarily in 2015 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as abandonment of leased facilities.

97745_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	Backlog Our backlog of firm orders at year-end 2015 and 2014 was as follows:
97745_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Backlog at year-end 2015 compared to the 2014 balance was affected by unfavorable currency translation.
97745_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	We believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2015 will be filled during 2016 .
97745_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results.

97745_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition.
97745_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors.
97745_16_ITEM1_P79_S3	Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development.
97745_16_ITEM1_P79_S4	Our success primarily depends on the following factors:
97745_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	relative prices of our products and services.
97745_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Environmental Matters We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries.
97745_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
97745_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.
97745_16_ITEM1_P81_S3	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.
97745_16_ITEM1_P81_S4	In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws.
97745_16_ITEM1_P81_S5	Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S3	Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S4	For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S5	Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S6	As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study.
97745_16_ITEM1_P82_S7	In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island.
97745_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $35 million at December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM1_P83_S4	These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled.
97745_16_ITEM1_P83_S5	We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur.
97745_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	As Thermo Fisher s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S2	In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S3	While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S4	To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S5	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S6	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S7	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_16_ITEM1_P85_S8	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.

97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Business under the caption "Forward-looking Statements".
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S5	We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S9	Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S11	As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S13	It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth .
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S14	Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P0_S15	To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
97745_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	For example, recent developments in Europe have created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	This debt crisis could result in customers in Europe taking longer to pay for products they have purchased from us, or being unable to pay at all.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	economies makes the strength and timing of any economic recovery uncertain, and there can be no assurance that global economic conditions will not deteriorate further.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In fiscal year 2013, the U.S. Government was unable to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	As a result, in early 2013, an enforcement mechanism known as sequestration went into effect, which triggered one year of budget reductions.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	In subsequent years, statutory spending caps have constrained federal funding levels.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Despite agreement not to impose similar cuts in fiscal years 2014 through 2017, it is possible that Congress will allow similar cuts to occur again in fiscal year 2018 and beyond.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the functional currency ).
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	In 2015 , currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $938 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	For 2016 , the company is expecting a significant negative impact on revenues and operating income due to the stronger U.S. dollar.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Healthcare reform legislation could adversely impact us.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act could have an adverse impact on us.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Some of the potential consequences, such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes to the delivery or pricing of healthcare services or products or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare-industry participants to purchase fewer of our products and services or to reduce the prices they are willing to pay for our products or services.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S8	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P9_S9	In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	With our acquisition of Life Technologies, we became party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property (Note 10 ).
97745_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If our security products do not operate as designed and fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $18.83 billion and $1.25 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $11.51 billion as of December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S8	We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S9	If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S10	In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S11	We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S12	For example, some of our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S13	These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S14	If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S15	We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S16	A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P20_S17	Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products .
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In 2012 the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The rule requires an annual disclosure report to be filed, and requires companies to perform due diligence and disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	As our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we undertake, which may harm our reputation.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Unforeseen problems with the implementation and maintenance of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our operations .
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Such problems could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S6	In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P25_S7	We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $12.53 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	In addition, we have a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S8	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S11	If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S12	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S13	The covenants in our revolving credit facility include a total debt-to-EBITDA ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S14	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the facility, or any letter of credit is outstanding under the facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) as at the last day of any fiscal quarter to be greater than 3.5 to 1.0 or the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense) to be less than 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S15	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S16	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_16_ITEM1A_P26_S17	Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.

97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion , an increase of $76 million from 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	Sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, net of divestitures.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, revenues increased $803 million ( 5% ) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S4	Sales to customers in the company s primary end markets grew.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S5	Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong, while sales to industrial markets and academic and government markets grew modestly in 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S6	Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and strong in Asia.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S7	Revenues and operating income of the company s non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars to report consolidated results.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S8	Based on weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in 2015 and early 2016, the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenues and operating income in 2016 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S9	In 2015 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8% , respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8% , respectively, in 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S10	The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the February 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S11	The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S12	These factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P6_S13	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	These initiatives resulted in additional foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (net benefit of $66 million), which reduced the company s effective rate by 3.4 percentage points.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	In addition, the company recorded tax benefits totaling $54 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million, or 1.9 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S6	The effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S7	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S8	The company s effective tax rate was 9.2% in 2014.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S9	The 2014 provision for income taxes included $390 million related to gains on the sales of businesses.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S10	Aside from the discrete tax on the gains, the company had a benefit from income taxes primarily due to restructuring and other costs associated with the acquisition of Life Technologies as well as an increase in the expected benefit from foreign tax credits.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S11	In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S12	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S13	The net result of these transactions favorably affected the income tax provision by $117 million and reduced the company s effective tax rate by 5.6 percentage points in 2014.
97745_16_ITEM7_P7_S14	The federal tax credit for 2014 research and development activities favorably affected the tax provision in 2014 by $20 million, or 1.0 percentage point.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	tax benefit of $15 million, or 0.7 percentage points, attributable to tax rulings related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	The tax provision in the 2014 period was favorably affected by $5.5 million, or 0.3 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2016 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	Income from continuing operations increased to $1.98 billion in 2015 , from $1.90 billion in 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	The decrease in operating income in the 2015 period (discussed above) was more than offset by an increase in the income tax benefit in the 2015 period (discussed above) and a decrease in interest expense of $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S5	During 2015 , the company s cash flow from operations totaled $2.82 billion compared with $2.62 billion for 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S6	The increase resulted from cash disbursements in the 2014 period totaling $325 million related to the acquisition of Life Technologies, including severance obligations, third-party transaction/integration costs and monetizing certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition, offset in part by lower payments in 2014 for incentive compensation as a result of Life Technologies having paid its annual incentive compensation prior to the acquisition.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S7	As of December 31, 2015 , the company s short-term debt totaled $1.05 billion , including $1.00 billion of senior notes, due in the next twelve months and $50 million of commercial paper obligations.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S8	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S9	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S10	As of December 31, 2015 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $65 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_16_ITEM7_P8_S11	The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $452 million as of December 31, 2015 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
97745_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs.
97745_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
97745_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
97745_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources.
97745_16_ITEM7_P9_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
97745_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due.
97745_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Such allowances totaled $70 million at December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	If the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
97745_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
97745_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
97745_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized.
97745_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.
97745_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.
97745_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $11.51 billion at December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
97745_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
97745_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
97745_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $18.83 billion and $1.25 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors.
97745_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	Projections of profitability for 2016 and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2015 , the date of the company s impairment testing.
97745_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired.
97745_16_ITEM7_P17_S4	Should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
97745_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes.
97745_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation.
97745_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale.
97745_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	Should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company s revenue recognition would be affected.
97745_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
97745_16_ITEM7_P18_S5	If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
97745_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers.
97745_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
97745_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	(e) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions.
97745_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.
97745_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
97745_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
97745_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	The company s reserve for these matters totaled $350 million at December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
97745_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
97745_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits.
97745_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income.
97745_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance.
97745_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision.
97745_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	The company s tax valuation allowance totaled $109 million at December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P24_S6	Should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
97745_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
97745_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes.
97745_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company s tax provision would result.
97745_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	(f) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
97745_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The accruals are based on management s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates.
97745_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value.
97745_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
97745_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	(g) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease.
97745_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels.
97745_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date.
97745_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $29 million in 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	The company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $528 million at year-end 2015 compared with $540 million at year-end 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
97745_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $102 million .
97745_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , the company expects to contribute between $30 and $50 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2016 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion , an increase of $76 million from 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	Sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, principally Life Technologies, net of divestitures.
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $803 million ( 5% ) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S4	Sales to customers in the company s primary end markets grew.
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S5	Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong.
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S6	Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and strong in Asia.
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S7	In 2015 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8% , respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8% , respectively, in 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S8	The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the February 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S9	The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability.
97745_16_ITEM7_P30_S10	These factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	In 2015 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million , including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Life Technologies and Alfa Aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation.
97745_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	In addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the U.S.
97745_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	The company s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
97745_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	The company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development.
97745_16_ITEM7_P31_S4	These costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate (see Note 14 ).
97745_16_ITEM7_P31_S5	In 2014 , the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements.
97745_16_ITEM7_P31_S6	The company incurred $268 million of cash restructuring costs primarily associated with the Life Technologies acquisition including cash compensation to monetize certain equity awards held by Life Technologies employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of Life Technologies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
97745_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	As of February 25, 2016 , the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $55 million in 2016 and expects to identify additional actions during 2016 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as abandonment of leased facilities.
97745_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Approximately 70% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, with the remainder incurred across the company s remaining segments.
97745_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2015 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and, to a greater extent, in 2016 , including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $15 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and to a greater extent in 2015 , including $80 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	The company also refers to this measure as adjusted operating income.
97745_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3 ).
97745_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.
97745_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 3% to $3.82 billion in 2015 due primarily to productivity improvements, net of inflationary costs increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies, offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and strategic growth investments.
97745_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $244 million to $4.44 billion in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of Life Technologies, net of divestitures.
97745_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, revenues for the 2015 period would have decreased $25 million compared to pro forma 2014 revenues, including a decrease of $278 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $213 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and an increase of $40 million due to other acquisitions, net of dispositions.
97745_16_ITEM7_P35_S2	The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioprocess production products as well as biosciences products.
97745_16_ITEM7_P35_S3	Operating income margin was 30.1% in 2015 compared to 29.0% in 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P35_S4	The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements (including acquisition cost synergies), net of inflationary cost increases and favorable sales mix.
97745_16_ITEM7_P35_S5	These increases were offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and, to a lesser extent, by exclusion in 2014 of January s lower margin results for Life Technologies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P35_S6	Results for January commonly have a lower margin rate than results for the balance of the quarter, due to the phasing of revenue and costs.
97745_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment decreased $44 million to $3.21 billion in 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	Sales decreased $189 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by increases of $141 million ( 4% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $4 million due to acquisitions.
97745_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for chromatography products and, to a lesser extent, sales of service offerings and increased demand for mass spectrometry instruments.
97745_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	These increases were offset in part by modestly lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain commodity materials markets.
97745_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	Operating income margin was 19.1% in 2015 compared to 17.9% in 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and profit on incremental sales in local currencies, offset in part by strategic growth investments and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange.
97745_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment decreased $100 million to $3.24 billion in 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	Sales decreased $197 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation offset in part by $86 million ( 3% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $11 million due to an acquisition net of a divestiture.
97745_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	These increases were offset in part by lower sales due to the expiration, in late 2014, of an OEM contract following the acquisition of the customer by a competitor.
97745_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Operating income margin was 26.9% in 2015 and 27.4% in 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign currency exchange, offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $60 million to $6.66 billion in 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	Sales increased $465 million ( 7% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	This increase was offset in part by $303 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation and $102 million due to a disposition, net of an acquisition.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment s principal businesses.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	Operating income margin was 15.0% in 2015 and 14.9% in 2014 .
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S5	The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases as well as profit on incremental sales in local currencies offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S6	Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $400 million and $416 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively (Note 4 ).
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S7	Interest expense decreased $65 million primarily due to a reduction in outstanding debt and effective interest rates.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S8	In 2015, other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S9	In 2014, other items, net includes net gains of $9 million on the sale of investments.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S10	Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S11	In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S12	These initiatives resulted in additional foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (net benefit of $66 million), which reduced the company s effective rate by 3.4 percentage points.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S13	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S14	In addition, the company recorded tax benefits totaling $54 million, or 2.8 percentage points, related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S15	The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million, or 1.9 percentage points, as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S16	The effective tax rate in both 2015 and 2014 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_16_ITEM7_P39_S17	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $477 million and $586 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

97745_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Unaudited Pro Forma Information Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed as of the beginning of 2013, the company s pro forma results for 2014 and 2013 would have been as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	Pro forma results include non-recurring pro forma adjustments that were directly attributable to the business combination to reflect amounts as if the acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of 2013, as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	Pre-tax reduction of revenues of $8 million and $24 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, for revaluing Life Technologies deferred revenue obligations to fair value.
97745_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	These pro forma results of operations have been prepared for comparative purposes only, and they do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the acquisition occurred on the date indicated or that may result in the future.
97745_16_ITEM15_P80_S2	The company s results would not have been materially different from its pro forma results had the company s other 2014 or 2015 acquisitions occurred at the beginning of 2013 or 2014, respectively.

97745_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million , included in restructuring and other costs (income), net.
97745_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	Due to the low tax basis in the Cole-Parmer business, the tax provision related to the sale slightly exceeded the pre-tax gain, resulting in a $4 million after-tax loss on the sale of the business.
97745_16_ITEM15_P81_S3	Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million , respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.

97745_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition accounting; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.
97745_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	(a) Represents operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring and other costs, net; and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.

97745_16_ITEM15_P94_S2	In 2013 , other items, net includes $74 million of charges related to amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments related to the Life Technologies acquisition offset in part by $5 million of gains from sales of equity investments.
97745_16_ITEM15_P94_S3	Additionally, the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans, resulting in realization of a previously unrecognized gain of $11 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others.
97745_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer.
97745_16_ITEM15_P95_S2	The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings.
97745_16_ITEM15_P95_S3	Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
97745_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.
97745_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	The components of stock-based compensation expense are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	Certain pre-acquisition equity awards of Life Technologies were converted to rights to receive future cash payments over the remaining vesting period.
97745_16_ITEM15_P97_S1	In addition to stock-based compensation, which is included in the above table, in 2015 and 2014 , the company recorded expense for cash-in-lieu of equity of $22 million and $35 million , respectively related to these arrangements.
97745_16_ITEM15_P97_S2	The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vestings in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company.
97745_16_ITEM15_P97_S3	The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates.
97745_16_ITEM15_P97_S4	The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes.
97745_16_ITEM15_P97_S5	Tax benefits recognized in capital in excess of par value in the accompanying balance sheet were $63 million , $65 million and $47 million , respectively, in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	The company s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value.
97745_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	Options vest over 3 - 5 years with terms of 7 - 10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P98_S2	Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_16_ITEM15_P99_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option.
97745_16_ITEM15_P101_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_16_ITEM15_P101_S3	The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.
97745_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P105_S0	The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 were $27.04 , $26.89 and $19.84 , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P105_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $181 million , $208 million and $190 million , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P106_S0	The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.
97745_16_ITEM15_P106_S1	A summary of the company s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented below:
97745_16_ITEM15_P107_S0	(a) Market price per share on December 31, 2015 was $141.85 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P107_S1	The intrinsic value is zero for options with exercise prices above the market price.
97745_16_ITEM15_P107_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , there was $72 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted.
97745_16_ITEM15_P107_S3	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2019 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.4 years .
97745_16_ITEM15_P108_S0	Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock.
97745_16_ITEM15_P108_S1	The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years , assuming continued employment, with some exceptions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P108_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P108_S3	The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_16_ITEM15_P108_S4	Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents.
97745_16_ITEM15_P108_S5	The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.
97745_16_ITEM15_P108_S6	For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.
97745_16_ITEM15_P109_S0	A summary of the company s restricted unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented below:
97745_16_ITEM15_P110_S0	The total fair value of shares vested during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $80 million , $61 million and $47 million , respectively.

97745_16_ITEM15_P110_S2	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2019 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.0 years .
97745_16_ITEM15_P111_S0	Employee Stock Purchase Plans Qualifying employees are eligible to participate in an employee stock purchase plan sponsored by the company.
97745_16_ITEM15_P111_S1	Shares may be purchased under the program at 95% of the fair market value at the end of the purchase period and the shares purchased are not subject to a holding period.
97745_16_ITEM15_P111_S2	Shares are purchased through payroll deductions of up to 10% of each participating employee s gross wages.
97745_16_ITEM15_P111_S3	The company issued 151,000 , 119,000 and 100,000 shares, respectively, of its common stock for the 2015 , 2014 and 2013 plan years, which ended on December 31.
97745_16_ITEM15_P112_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 401(k) Savings Plan and Other Defined Contribution Plans The company s 401(k) savings and other defined contribution plans cover the majority of the company s eligible U.S. and certain non-U.S. employees.
97745_16_ITEM15_P112_S1	Contributions to the plans are made by both the employee and the company.
97745_16_ITEM15_P112_S2	Company contributions are based on the level of employee contributions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P112_S3	Company contributions to these plans are based on formulas determined by the company.
97745_16_ITEM15_P112_S4	In 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the company charged to expense $131 million , $118 million and $87 million , respectively, related to its defined contribution plans.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S0	Defined Benefit Pension Plans Employees of a number of the company s non-U.S. and certain U.S. subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees at those subsidiaries.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S1	Some of the plans are unfunded, as permitted under the plans and applicable laws.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S2	The company also maintains postretirement healthcare programs at several acquired businesses where certain employees are eligible to participate.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S3	The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S4	The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S5	This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S6	The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_16_ITEM15_P113_S7	Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset.
97745_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.
97745_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.
97745_16_ITEM15_P115_S1	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , the company made cash contributions of approximately $38 million , $50 million and $38 million , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P115_S2	Additionally, in 2013 the company irrevocably contributed appreciated available-for-sale investments that had a fair value of $27 million to two of its U.K. defined benefit plans.
97745_16_ITEM15_P115_S3	Contributions to the plans included in the following table are estimated at between $30 and $50 million for 2016 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the company s domestic and non-U.S. pension plans and postretirement benefit plans:
97745_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table:
97745_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2016 and 2033 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_16_ITEM15_P121_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.
97745_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management s expectations of future salary increases.
97745_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2016 are not material.
97745_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.
97745_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	The net periodic pension benefit cost (income) includes the following components:
97745_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	The net periodic postretirement benefit cost was not material in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	The company offered to settle pension obligations for former employee participants in certain defined benefit plans in 2014.
97745_16_ITEM15_P130_S1	The company recorded a charge of $30 million associated with those plan participants electing to accept the settlement offer.
97745_16_ITEM15_P130_S2	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P130_S3	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_16_ITEM15_P130_S4	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P131_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2015 would not have caused a material change in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 and the 2015 aggregate of service and interest costs.
97745_16_ITEM15_P132_S0	The company s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates.
97745_16_ITEM15_P132_S1	The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility.
97745_16_ITEM15_P132_S2	The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities.
97745_16_ITEM15_P132_S3	The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 1% of invested assets) of private equity investments.
97745_16_ITEM15_P132_S4	The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 27% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately 2% to real estate-related equities, approximately 24% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 47% to funds investing in fixed income securities.
97745_16_ITEM15_P132_S5	The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_16_ITEM15_P133_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_16_ITEM15_P133_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_16_ITEM15_P133_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_16_ITEM15_P134_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_16_ITEM15_P134_S1	For plans not currently managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 35% - 70% for equities and 30% - 65% for fixed income securities.
97745_16_ITEM15_P134_S2	For plans managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments also include hedge funds, multi-asset funds and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 4% - 18% for equities, 45% - 65% for fixed income, 10% - 20% for hedge funds, 4% - 5% for multi-asset funds and 20% - 30% for funds holding derivatives.
97745_16_ITEM15_P134_S3	The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P134_S4	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_16_ITEM15_P135_S0	The fair values of the company s plan assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , by asset category are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P136_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12 ).
97745_16_ITEM15_P136_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured using net asset value per share (or its equivalent) and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P137_S0	The fair value of the company s private equity investments, which are classified as level 3 investments, are based on valuations provided by the respective funds.
97745_16_ITEM15_P138_S0	There was no significant activity within the level 3 pension plan assets during the years presented.
97745_16_ITEM15_P139_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P140_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P141_S0	The income tax provision (benefit) included in the accompanying statement of income is as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P142_S0	The company receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_16_ITEM15_P142_S1	The provision for income taxes that is currently payable does not reflect $63 million , $65 million and $47 million of such benefits that have been allocated to capital in excess of par value in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P143_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S0	In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S1	As a result of these initiatives, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2015.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S2	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S3	Also in 2015, the company recorded benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S4	In 2014, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S5	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2014.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S6	In 2013, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S7	As a result of these distributions, the company generated U.S. foreign tax credits of $160 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $56 million on the related foreign income which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2013.
97745_16_ITEM15_P144_S8	In addition, the impact of tax law changes in certain foreign jurisdictions reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2013.
97745_16_ITEM15_P145_S0	The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives.
97745_16_ITEM15_P145_S1	The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore.
97745_16_ITEM15_P145_S2	This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2021 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P145_S3	In 2015 and 2014 , the impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rates by 1.1% and 1.6% , respectively, and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 and $0.08 , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P146_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_16_ITEM15_P147_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized.
97745_16_ITEM15_P147_S1	At December 31, 2015 , all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_16_ITEM15_P147_S2	At December 31, 2015 , the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $109 million , $1.24 billion and $2.32 billion , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S0	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S1	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2016 through 2035 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S2	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $319 million expire in the years 2016 through 2035 , and the remainder do not expire.
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S3	The company also had $379 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2015 , which expire in the years 2017 through 2025 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S4	A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $8.64 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because the company plans to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas except for instances where the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without an associated net tax cost.
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S5	It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized tax liability due to i) the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used (among several possibilities) should a decision be made to repatriate; ii) the availability and the complexity of calculating foreign tax credits; and iii) the implications of indirect taxes, including withholding taxes that could potentially be required depending on the repatriation structure.
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S6	Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2015 , the company had $350 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_16_ITEM15_P148_S7	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P149_S0	During 2015, the company s unrecognized tax benefits increased $70 million due to the utilization of deferred tax assets and $28 million relating to foreign net operating losses on which the company has a deferred tax asset established.
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S0	was offset in part by a reduction of $10 million from a resolution of an IRS audit of Life Technologies for which a reserve had previously been established.
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S1	Of the total $350 million of liability, $3 million is classified as a current liability and the remainder is long-term.
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S2	During 2014, the company acquired Life Technologies which resulted in an increase in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $54 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S3	The liability also increased due to the provision of tax reserves, primarily related to the sale of the divested businesses and a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction.
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S4	During 2014, the company settled the IRS audit relating to the 2010 and 2011 tax years which resulted in a decrease in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $48 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S5	During 2013, the company settled the IRS audit relating to the 2008 and 2009 tax years which resulted in a decrease in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $9 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S6	The liability was also reduced by $21 million due to the company s withdrawal of a U.S. court case relating to the 2001 to 2003 tax years.
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S7	Additionally, in 2013, the company benefited from a favorable resolution of a court case in Sweden which resulted in a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $21 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S8	Of the total $21 million , $17 million reduced income tax expense.
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S9	The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
97745_16_ITEM15_P150_S10	The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $19 million and $16 million , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P151_S0	The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P151_S1	In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
97745_16_ITEM15_P151_S2	With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2011.
97745_16_ITEM15_P152_S0	Options to purchase 3.4 million , 2.4 million and 1.0 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive.
97745_16_ITEM15_P153_S0	The effective interest rates for the fixed-rate debt include the stated interest on the notes, the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.
97745_16_ITEM15_P153_S1	See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company s long-term obligations.

97745_16_ITEM15_P155_S4	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_16_ITEM15_P155_S5	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $2.00 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.

97745_16_ITEM15_P155_S8	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_16_ITEM15_P155_S9	The financial covenant requires the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) below 3.5 to 1.0 and an Interest Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) to interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_16_ITEM15_P156_S0	The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes.
97745_16_ITEM15_P156_S1	The credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
97745_16_ITEM15_P156_S2	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_16_ITEM15_P156_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $65 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_16_ITEM15_P157_S0	The company has a U.S. commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes).
97745_16_ITEM15_P157_S1	Maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and the CP Notes rank pari passu with all of the company s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
97745_16_ITEM15_P157_S2	CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment.
97745_16_ITEM15_P158_S0	CP Notes are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
97745_16_ITEM15_P158_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , outstanding borrowings under this program were $50 million , with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 47 days and are classified as short-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet.

97745_16_ITEM15_P159_S1	The term loan agreement called for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_16_ITEM15_P159_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , all borrowings under the term loan agreement had been repaid.
97745_16_ITEM15_P159_S3	The company recorded a charge of $3 million for the early extinguishment of this debt in 2015.

97745_16_ITEM15_P160_S2	Each of the notes may be redeemed at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus a specified make-whole premium plus accrued interest.
97745_16_ITEM15_P161_S0	The company is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes, the most restrictive of which limits the ability of the company to pledge principal properties as security under borrowing arrangements.

97745_16_ITEM15_P162_S2	The fair value of these senior notes on the date of acquisition exceeded the par value by $207 million which was recorded as part of the carrying value of the underlying debt and will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining terms of the respective debt instruments.
97745_16_ITEM15_P162_S3	This adjustment does not affect cash interest payments.
97745_16_ITEM15_P163_S0	The company has entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swap arrangements with various banks on several of its outstanding senior notes.
97745_16_ITEM15_P163_S1	The aggregate amounts of the swaps are equal to the principal amounts of the notes and the payment dates of the swaps coincide with the interest payment dates of the notes.
97745_16_ITEM15_P163_S2	The swap contracts provide for the company to pay a variable interest rate and receive a fixed rate.
97745_16_ITEM15_P163_S3	The variable interest rates reset monthly.

97745_16_ITEM15_P167_S3	The expiration of these bonds and guarantees ranges through 2017.
97745_16_ITEM15_P168_S0	The letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds principally secure performance obligations, and allow the holder to draw funds up to the face amount of the letter of credit, bank guarantee or surety bond if the applicable business unit does not perform as contractually required.
97745_16_ITEM15_P168_S1	The outstanding letters of credit, bank guarantees and surety bonds disclosed above include $18 million for businesses that have been sold.
97745_16_ITEM15_P168_S2	The company is a guarantor of pension plan obligations of a divested business.
97745_16_ITEM15_P168_S3	The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so.
97745_16_ITEM15_P168_S4	The amount of the guarantee at December 31, 2015 was $41 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P169_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_16_ITEM15_P169_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.
97745_16_ITEM15_P169_S2	However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.
97745_16_ITEM15_P170_S0	The company has funding commitments totaling $2 million at December 31, 2015 , related to investments it owns.
97745_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	In 2012, the company entered into an off-balance sheet build-to-suit financing arrangement with a financial institution to fund construction of an operating facility in the U.S. Upon completion of construction in 2014, a five-year lease commenced with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms.
97745_16_ITEM15_P171_S1	The company has agreed with the lessor to comply with certain financial covenants consistent with its other debt arrangements (Note 9 ), and has guaranteed the facility s residual value at the end of the lease, up to a maximum of $58 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P172_S0	In 2015, a leased operating facility was purchased by a financial institution and the company entered into a revised lease.
97745_16_ITEM15_P172_S1	The new lease has a term of 5 years with options to purchase the facility or renew the lease for up to three 5-year terms.
97745_16_ITEM15_P172_S2	The company has guaranteed the facility's residual value at the end of the lease, up to a maximum of $53 million .
97745_16_ITEM15_P173_S0	In conjunction with certain transactions, primarily divestitures, the company has agreed to indemnify the other parties with respect to certain liabilities related to the businesses that were sold or leased properties that were abandoned (e.g., retention of certain environmental, tax, employee and product liabilities).
97745_16_ITEM15_P173_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_16_ITEM15_P173_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_16_ITEM15_P174_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_16_ITEM15_P174_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_16_ITEM15_P174_S2	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_16_ITEM15_P174_S3	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_16_ITEM15_P174_S4	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_16_ITEM15_P175_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.
97745_16_ITEM15_P176_S0	In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.
97745_16_ITEM15_P176_S1	The company has not been required to make material payments under such provisions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P177_S0	The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters.
97745_16_ITEM15_P177_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented.
97745_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_16_ITEM15_P179_S2	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_16_ITEM15_P179_S3	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the company s total environmental liability was approximately $35 million and $32 million , respectively.
97745_16_ITEM15_P179_S4	While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment, and contractual issues.
97745_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters.
97745_16_ITEM15_P180_S2	A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S1	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S2	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S3	Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S4	The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S5	Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, and, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, to make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S6	The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below, nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S7	It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
97745_16_ITEM15_P181_S8	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2015 , was approximately $246 million to $397 million on an undiscounted basis.

97745_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67% ).
97745_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $36 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $23 million (net discount $13 million ) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_16_ITEM15_P184_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.

97745_16_ITEM15_P192_S1	Other comprehensive items represent certain amounts that are reported as components of shareholders equity in the accompanying balance sheet.
97745_16_ITEM15_P192_S2	Changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive items, net of tax are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S0	Shareholders Equity At December 31, 2015 , the company had reserved 36.1 million unissued shares of its common stock for possible issuance under stock-based compensation plans.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S1	The company has 50,000 shares of authorized but unissued $100 par value preferred stock.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S2	In June 2013, in anticipation of the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into equity forward agreements.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S3	The use of the equity forward agreements substantially eliminated future equity market price risk by fixing a common equity offering sales price under the then existing market conditions, while mitigating share dilution from the offering by postponing the actual issuance of common stock until the funds were needed for the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S4	Upon settlement of the agreements, in January 2014, the company issued and delivered 29.6 million shares of its common stock at the then applicable forward sale price of $82.5342 per share.

97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S6	The equity forward and subscription agreements had no initial fair value as they were entered into at the then market price of the common stock.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S7	The company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock until the agreements were settled.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S8	Upon settlement, the proceeds were recorded in equity.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S9	Prior to their settlement, to the extent that the equity forward agreements were dilutive, they have been reflected in the company s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method.
97745_16_ITEM15_P193_S10	Prior to closing, the subscription agreement was not potentially dilutive to the company s diluted earnings per share calculations due to its contingent nature.
97745_16_ITEM15_P194_S0	The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2015 .
97745_16_ITEM15_P194_S1	The company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in money market funds, derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration.
97745_16_ITEM15_P194_S2	The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
97745_16_ITEM15_P194_S3	Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.
97745_16_ITEM15_P194_S4	Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.

97745_16_ITEM15_P196_S0	The following table presents information about the company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 :
97745_16_ITEM15_P197_S0	The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer.
97745_16_ITEM15_P197_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates.
97745_16_ITEM15_P197_S2	The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on assessment of the probability that the company would be required to make such future payment.
97745_16_ITEM15_P197_S3	Changes to the fair value of contingent consideration are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.
97745_16_ITEM15_P197_S4	The following table provides a rollforward of the fair value, as determined by level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration.
97745_16_ITEM15_P198_S0	The notional amounts of derivative contracts outstanding, consisting of interest rate swaps and currency exchange contracts, totaled $6.63 billion and $3.74 billion at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , respectively.

97745_16_ITEM15_P199_S1	The following tables present the fair value of derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of income.
97745_16_ITEM15_P200_S0	(a) The fair value of the interest rate swaps is included in the consolidated balance sheet under the captions other assets or other accrued expenses.
97745_16_ITEM15_P200_S1	(b) The fair value of the currency exchange contracts is included in the consolidated balance sheet under the captions other current assets or other accrued expenses.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S0	(a) The ineffective portion of the loss recognized on interest rate swaps during 2015 includes $7.5 million of costs associated with entering into the swap arrangements.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S1	Gains and losses recognized on currency exchange contracts and the effective portion of interest rate swaps are included in the consolidated statement of income together with the corresponding, offsetting losses and gains on the underlying hedged transactions.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S2	Gains and losses recognized on the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are included in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S3	The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S4	The company s euro-denominated senior notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S5	Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income and shareholders equity.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S6	In 2015 and 2014 , pre-tax net gains of $77 million and $21 million , respectively, from the euro-denominated notes were included in currency translation adjustment.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S7	In February 2015, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering in 2016.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S8	Based on the company s conclusion that a debt offering is probable as a result of debt maturing in 2016 and that such debt would carry semi-annual interest payments over a 10 -year term, the swaps hedge the cash flow risk for each of the semi-annual fixed-rate interest payments on $1.00 billion of principal amount of the planned 10 -year fixed-rate debt issue.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S9	The hedge will be terminated upon completion of a debt offering in 2016.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S10	The fair value of the hedge at that time will be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholders equity and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt.
97745_16_ITEM15_P201_S11	The change in the fair value of the hedge, $9 million , net of tax, as of December 31, 2015 , was classified as a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive items.
97745_16_ITEM15_P202_S0	In 2013, prior to issuing the 4.15% Senior Notes due 2024, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the risk of interest rates rising prior to completion of a debt offering.

97745_16_ITEM15_P203_S1	In December 2013, the company issued senior notes and terminated the swap arrangements.
97745_16_ITEM15_P203_S2	The company received $11 million at the termination of these agreements and recorded a gain of $1 million on the ineffective portion in other expense, net in the accompanying statement of income.
97745_16_ITEM15_P203_S3	The remaining favorable change in the fair value of the hedge upon termination (the effective portion) was $6 million , net of tax, and was classified as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive items within shareholder s equity and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt through 2024.
97745_16_ITEM15_P204_S0	The carrying value and fair value of the company s notes receivable and debt obligations are as follows:
97745_16_ITEM15_P205_S0	The fair value of debt obligations was determined based on quoted market prices and on borrowing rates available to the company at the respective period ends which represent level 2 measurements.

97745_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Raw Materials Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources.
97745_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business.
97745_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions.
97745_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results.
97745_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	Patents, Licenses and Trademarks Patents are important in many aspects of our business.
97745_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole.
97745_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest.
97745_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.
97745_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products.

97745_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Seasonal Influences Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers.

97745_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period s airborne pollen allergens.
97745_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.
97745_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	Dependency on a Single Customer There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years.
97745_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Backlog Our backlog of firm orders at year-end 2016 and 2015 was as follows:
97745_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	We believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2016 will be filled during 2017 .
97745_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results.
97745_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve.
97745_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition.
97745_17_ITEM1_P82_S2	Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors.
97745_17_ITEM1_P82_S3	Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development.
97745_17_ITEM1_P82_S4	Our success primarily depends on the following factors:
97745_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	relative prices of our products and services.
97745_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	Environmental Matters We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries.
97745_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
97745_17_ITEM1_P84_S2	We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.
97745_17_ITEM1_P84_S3	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.
97745_17_ITEM1_P84_S4	In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws.
97745_17_ITEM1_P84_S5	Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.
97745_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws.
97745_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
97745_17_ITEM1_P85_S2	Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters.
97745_17_ITEM1_P85_S3	Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material.
97745_17_ITEM1_P85_S4	For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.
97745_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program.
97745_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study.
97745_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island.
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S2	We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S3	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $49 million at December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S4	These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled.
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S5	We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur.
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S6	As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM1_P87_S7	However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	As Thermo Fisher s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S2	In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S3	While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S4	To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S5	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S6	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S7	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_17_ITEM1_P88_S8	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	Number of Employees We have approximately 55,000 employees.
97745_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	Financial Information About Geographic Areas Financial information about geographic areas is summarized in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.

97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Business under the caption "Forward-looking Statements".
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S9	Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S11	As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S13	It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth .
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S14	Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P0_S15	To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
97745_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the functional currency ).
97745_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Should our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In 2016 , currency translation had an unfavorable effect of $145 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Significant developments stemming from the recent U.S. presidential election or the U.K. s referendum on membership in the EU could have an adverse effect on us.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The new U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China and Mexico.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The new administration has also indicated an intention to request Congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom s referendum.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers businesses.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P10_S6	Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our Life Technologies subsidiary is party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property (Note 10 ).
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P11_S8	In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S6	For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P13_S7	Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If our security products do not operate as designed and fail to detect explosives or radiation, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our inability to complete pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $21.33 billion and $1.34 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $12.63 billion as of December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM1A_P16_S7	We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S8	For example, some of our operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S9	These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S10	If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and/or cease their manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S11	We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S12	A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S13	Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S14	We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P21_S15	Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $16.63 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S7	If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S8	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S9	The covenants in our revolving credit facility and our term facility (each, a Facility and together, the Facilities ) include a total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA ratio and an interest coverage ratio.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S10	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the revolving credit facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, it will not permit (as the following terms are defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (the ratio of consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA) to be greater than 4.5 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the first two consecutive quarters following the acquisition of FEI (see Note 2 ), with such ratio stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 for the two immediately following fiscal quarters and then stepping down to 3.5 to 1.0 for each fiscal quarter thereafter.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S11	The company s term facility includes Consolidated Leverage Ratio covenants substantively the same as the covenant included in the revolving credit facility.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S12	The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the revolving credit facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the revolving credit facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under any Facility (including the term loan and bridge facilities), it will not permit the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense) to be less than 3.0 to 1.0 as at the last day of any fiscal quarter.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S13	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S14	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_17_ITEM1A_P28_S15	Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
97745_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The location and general character of our principal properties by segment are as follows: Life Sciences Solutions We own approximately 4.9 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in New York, California, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Maryland and Illinois, within the U.S., and in Germany, the U.K., China, Lithuania, Denmark and Belgium.

97745_17_ITEM2_P0_S8	Corporate Headquarters We own approximately 127,000 square feet of office space in Massachusetts.
97745_17_ITEM2_P0_S9	We believe that all of the facilities that we are currently using are in good condition and are suitable and adequate to meet our current needs.
97745_17_ITEM2_P0_S10	If we are unable to renew any of the leases that are due to expire in 2017 or 2018 , we believe that suitable replacement properties are available on commercially reasonable terms.
97745_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are various lawsuits and claims against the company involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues.
97745_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments and Contingencies.
97745_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TMO.
97745_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of the company s common stock for 2016 and 2015 , as reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system.
97745_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	The closing price of the company s common stock on December 31, 2016 and 2015 , was $141.10 and $141.85 , respectively.

97745_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	Holders of Common Stock As of February 4, 2017 , the company had 3,937 holders of record of its common stock.
97745_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	This does not include holdings in street or nominee names.

97745_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which begin on page F-1 of this report.
97745_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide.
97745_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses.
97745_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	The company s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3 ): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.
97745_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	The company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	The company s principal recent acquisitions and divestitures are described below.
97745_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	On February 3, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Life Technologies Corporation for a total purchase price of $15.30 billion, net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $2.28 billion of debt.
97745_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	The company issued debt and common stock in late 2013 and early 2014 to partially fund the acquisition discussed below under the caption Liquidity and Capital Resources .
97745_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Life Technologies was integrated into the Life Sciences Solutions segment and provides innovative products and services to customers conducting scientific research and genetic analysis, as well as those in applied markets, such as forensics and food safety testing.
97745_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Life Technologies revenues totaled $3.87 billion in 2013.
97745_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	On March 21, 2014, the company sold its legacy sera and media, gene modulation and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare for $1.06 billion, net of cash divested.
97745_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	The sale of these businesses resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $761 million included in restructuring and other costs (income), net.
97745_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	The businesses fell principally in the Life Sciences Solutions segment.
97745_17_ITEM7_P3_S5	Divestiture of these businesses was a condition to obtaining antitrust approval for the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_17_ITEM7_P3_S6	Revenues and operating income of the businesses sold were approximately $250 million and $64 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $61 million and $12 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.
97745_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	On August 15, 2014, the company sold its Cole-Parmer specialty channel business, part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment, for $480 million in cash, net of cash divested.
97745_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	The sale of this business resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $134 million, included in restructuring and other costs (income), net.
97745_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	Revenues and operating income of the business sold were approximately $232 million and $43 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $149 million and $28 million, respectively, in 2014 through the date of sale.
97745_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	In February 2015, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Advanced Scientifics, Inc., a North America-based global provider of single-use systems and process equipment for bioprocess production, for approximately $289 million .
97745_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The acquisition expanded the company s bioprocessing offerings.
97745_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Revenues of Advanced Scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.
97745_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	On September 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Alfa Aesar, a U.K.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from Johnson Matthey Plc, for 257 million ( $393 million ) in cash.
97745_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The acquisition expanded the company s existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents.
97745_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Revenues of Alfa Aesar were approximately 78 million in 2014.
97745_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	On March 31, 2016, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Affymetrix, Inc., a North America-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion , net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt.
97745_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	The acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications.
97745_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	Additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays.
97745_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Revenues of Affymetrix were $360 million in 2015.
97745_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	On September 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, FEI Company, a North America-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion , net of cash acquired.
97745_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	The acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes.
97745_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	Revenues of FEI were $930 million in 2015.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion , an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million ( 4% ) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	Sales to customers in the company s primary end markets grew.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in Europe and modest in North America.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S7	Based on the weakening of currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar that occurred in 2016, the company currently expects that there will be a continued adverse effect on reported amounts of revenue and operating income in 2017 as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S8	In 2016 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4% , respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8% , respectively, in 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S9	The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P8_S10	These increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.
97745_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The company s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience.
97745_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million , offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million .
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S6	The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S7	Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S8	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S9	In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S10	The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S11	In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S12	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S13	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million.
97745_17_ITEM7_P10_S14	The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	The effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2017 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S5	Income from continuing operations increased to $2.03 billion in 2016 , from $1.98 billion in 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S6	The increase in operating income in the 2016 period (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $55 million primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and a lower tax benefit from income taxes in 2016.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S7	During 2016 , the company s cash flow from operations totaled $3.16 billion compared with $2.82 billion for 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S8	The increase primarily resulted from lower investments in working capital and higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2016 period.
97745_17_ITEM7_P11_S9	As of December 31, 2016 , the company s short-term debt totaled $1.26 billion , including $300 million due within the next twelve months under a 3-year term loan agreement and $953 million of commercial paper obligations.
97745_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $786 million as of December 31, 2016 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
97745_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs.
97745_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
97745_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
97745_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources.
97745_17_ITEM7_P13_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due.
97745_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Such allowances totaled $77 million at December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	The company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable, the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	If the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate, reducing their ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required.
97745_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment.
97745_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	If ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand, additional writedowns may be required.
97745_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
97745_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized.
97745_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.
97745_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.
97745_17_ITEM7_P18_S2	Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $12.63 billion at December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P18_S3	The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_17_ITEM7_P18_S4	Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
97745_17_ITEM7_P18_S5	The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
97745_17_ITEM7_P18_S6	Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
97745_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $21.33 billion and $1.34 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors.
97745_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	Indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2017 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2016 , the date of the company s impairment testing.
97745_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired.
97745_17_ITEM7_P20_S4	Should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
97745_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	With the completion of the FEI acquisition in September 2016, the company established a new reporting unit called Materials and Structural Analysis, which consists of the former FEI business.
97745_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business, the book value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date, no cushion of fair value over book value existed at the acquisition date.
97745_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	During its 2016 goodwill impairment testing, the company determined that the Materials and Structural Analysis reporting unit s cushion of fair value over book value was nominal as of November 5, 2016.
97745_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	Given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from forecasted results or changes in discount rates or other assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill.
97745_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	The key variables that drive the cash flows of the reporting unit are levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate applied.
97745_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The estimates used for these assumptions represent management's best estimates, which the company believes are reasonable.
97745_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	These assumptions, however, are subject to uncertainty, including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability levels.
97745_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The Materials and Structural Analysis reporting unit had $1.99 billion of goodwill, and had an overall carrying value of $3.93 billion as of December 31, 2016.
97745_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation, the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes.
97745_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	The company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation.
97745_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	The allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative selling price at the time of sale.
97745_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	Should the relative value of either the equipment or the installation change, the company s revenue recognition would be affected.
97745_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	In instances where the company sells equipment with customer-specified acceptance criteria, the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition.
97745_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	If the nature of customer-specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence, the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing.
97745_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	The company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers.
97745_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Should a greater or lesser number of products be returned, additional adjustments to revenue may be required.
97745_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	(e) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.
97745_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
97745_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
97745_17_ITEM7_P27_S4	The company s reserve for these matters totaled $802 million at December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P27_S5	Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.
97745_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits.
97745_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	Changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income.
97745_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance.
97745_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision.
97745_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	The company s tax valuation allowance totaled $113 million at December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	Should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
97745_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates.
97745_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes.
97745_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained, a reduction in the company s tax provision would result.
97745_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	The company operates in various jurisdictions around the world.
97745_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	With the exception of its Affymetrix Singapore subsidiary, the company has not provided income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries due to its intention to permanently reinvest such earnings unless the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without associated net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	The company recorded a deferred tax liability of $156 million in acquisition accounting for the outside basis difference of Affymetrix Singapore as the company intends to integrate it with the company s existing Singapore operations within the next twelve months.
97745_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	Aside from this plan, the company s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	(f) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
97745_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	The accruals are based on management s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates.
97745_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	discounted to their net present value.
97745_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
97745_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	(g) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease.
97745_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels.
97745_17_ITEM7_P34_S3	Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date.
97745_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	Net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $34 million in 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P35_S1	The company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $610 million at year-end 2016 compared with $528 million at year-end 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
97745_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $93 million .
97745_17_ITEM7_P35_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , the company expects to contribute between $215 and $235 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2017 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	As of January 1, 2017, the company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	Historically, the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate used to measure each plan's benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.
97745_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Beginning in 2017, the company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	The company has made this change to provide a more precise measurement of the service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates.
97745_17_ITEM7_P36_S4	The company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and will account for it prospectively starting in January 2017.
97745_17_ITEM7_P36_S5	The reduction in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change in estimate will be approximately $10 million .
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	Sales in 2016 were $18.27 billion , an increase of $1.31 billion from 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $145 million in 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	Sales increased $733 million due to acquisitions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, revenues increased $721 million ( 4% ) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S4	Sales to customers in the company s primary end markets grew.
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S5	Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong.
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S6	Sales growth was strong in Asia, moderate in Europe and modest in North America.
97745_17_ITEM7_P37_S7	In 2016 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.45 billion and 13.4% , respectively, compared with $2.34 billion and 13.8% , respectively, in 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	These increases were offset in part by higher restructuring and acquisition-related charges in the 2016 period, strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	In 2016 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $395 million , including $102 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and to conform the accounting policies of FEI and Affymetrix with the company's accounting policies; $104 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for third-party transaction and integration costs related to the acquisitions of FEI and Affymetrix.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, the company recorded $164 million of cash restructuring costs, primarily to achieve acquisition synergies, including severance and abandoned facilities costs associated with the closure and consolidation of facilities in the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	The company s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated in the U.S., Europe and Asia (see Note 14 ).
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S4	The company also recorded charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S5	These costs were partially offset by gains on the sales of real estate.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S6	In 2015 , the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Life Technologies and Alfa Aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S7	In addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S8	The company s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S9	The company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S10	These costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S11	As of February 28, 2017 , the company has identified restructuring actions that will result in additional charges of approximately $85 million in 2017 and expects to identify additional actions during 2017 which will be recorded when specified criteria are met, such as communication of benefit arrangements and abandonment of leased facilities.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S12	Approximately 45% of the additional charges will be incurred in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, 35% in the Analytical Instruments segment, with the remainder incurred across the company's remaining segments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S13	The restructuring projects for which charges were incurred in 2016 are expected to result in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2016 and, to a greater extent, in 2017 , including $60 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $5 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $10 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_17_ITEM7_P38_S14	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2015 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $100 million beginning in part in 2015 and to a greater extent in 2016 , including $50 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $25 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $15 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3 ).
97745_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.
97745_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 10% to $4.22 billion in 2016 due primarily to profit on higher sales in local currencies and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.
97745_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.
97745_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $539 million to $4.98 billion in 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Sales increased $315 million ( 7% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $261 million due to acquisitions, offset in part by a decrease of $38 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.

97745_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	Operating income margin was 30.4% in 2016 compared to 30.1% in 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	The increase in operating margin resulted from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, price increases.
97745_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix, acquisition dilution and strategic growth investments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $460 million to $3.67 billion in 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Sales increased $387 million due to acquisitions and $100 million ( 3% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, offset in part by a decrease of $27 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products sold by the segment's chromatography and mass spectrometry business and, to a lesser extent, sales of environmental instruments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	These increases were offset in part by lower sales of chemical analysis products due primarily to softness in certain industrial end markets.
97745_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	Operating income margin was 20.3% in 2016 compared to 19.1% in 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P42_S5	The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, favorable foreign currency exchange.
97745_17_ITEM7_P42_S6	These increases were offset in part by unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $95 million to $3.34 billion in 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Sales increased $115 million ( 4% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses, offset in part by a decrease of $20 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment's principal businesses with particular strength in the segment s healthcare market channel and sales of immunodiagnostics products and clinical diagnostics products.
97745_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Operating income margin was 27.2% in 2016 and 26.9% in 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	The increase resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales in local currencies, offset in part by strategic growth investments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Sales in the Laboratory Products and Services segment increased $369 million to $7.03 billion in 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	Sales increased $354 million ( 5% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $90 million due to an acquisition.
97745_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	These increases were offset in part by $76 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation.
97745_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	The increase in revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for products in each of the segment s principal businesses.
97745_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	Operating income margin was 15.0% in both 2016 and 2015 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P44_S5	Increases due to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and profit on higher sales in local currencies, were offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable sales mix.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $425 million and $400 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively (Note 4 ).
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Interest expense increased $55 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	I n 2016 , other items, net includes $22 million of charges related to the amortization of fees paid to obtain bridge financing commitments for the acquisition of FEI and $9 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt, offset in part by $12.5 million of gains on investments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	In 2015 , other items, net includes losses of $12 million on the early extinguishment of debt and costs of $7.5 million associated with entering into interest rate swap arrangements.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	Provision for Income Taxes The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S5	In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S6	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S7	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million , offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million .
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S8	The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S9	The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S10	The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S11	Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S12	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S13	In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S14	The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2015.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S15	In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S16	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S17	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million, offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2015) for a net benefit of $66 million.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S18	The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S19	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S20	In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S21	The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S22	The effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S23	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S24	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2017 will be less than 3% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S25	The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S26	All of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S27	The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S28	The company s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries.
97745_17_ITEM7_P45_S29	Based on the dispersion of the company s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.
97745_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading Recent Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1 .
97745_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	The company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters.
97745_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the headings Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters," "Intellectual Property Matters" and "Commercial Matters" in Note 10 could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Sales in 2015 were $16.97 billion, an increase of $76 million from 2014.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	The unfavorable effects of currency translation resulted in a decrease in revenues of $938 million in 2015.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Sales increased $212 million due to acquisitions, principally Life Technologies, net of divestitures.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S3	Aside from the effects of currency translation and acquisitions/divestitures, revenues increased $803 million (5%) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S4	Sales to customers in the company s primary end markets grew.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S5	Demand from customers in pharmaceutical and biotech industries was particularly strong.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S6	Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and strong in Asia.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S7	In 2015, total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.34 billion and 13.8%, respectively, compared with $2.50 billion and 14.8%, respectively, in 2014.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S8	The decrease in operating income and operating income margin was primarily due to net gains of $895 million on the sale of businesses in 2014, offset in part by $450 million of charges in 2014 associated with the February 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S9	The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange also contributed to the decrease in profitability.
97745_17_ITEM7_P48_S10	These factors that reduced operating income in 2015 were offset in part by productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies.
97745_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	In 2015, the company recorded restructuring and other costs, net, of $171 million, including $9 million of charges to cost of revenues for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and, to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation; $46 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for charges associated with product liability litigation, third-party transaction and integration costs primarily related to the acquisitions of Life Technologies and Alfa Aesar, and accelerated depreciation at facilities closing due to real estate consolidation.
97745_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	In addition, the company recorded $82 million of cash restructuring costs primarily for actions to achieve synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and for abandoned facilities costs associated with a manufacturing facility in the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	The company s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
97745_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	The company also recorded charges for litigation-related matters associated with acquired businesses and impairment of acquired technology in development.
97745_17_ITEM7_P49_S4	These costs were partially offset by gains on the sale of a small product line and real estate (see Note 14 ).
97745_17_ITEM7_P49_S5	In 2014, the company recorded restructuring and other income, net, of $140 million, including net gains on the sale of businesses and real estate of $895 million and $15 million, respectively, offset in part by $328 million of charges to cost of revenues primarily for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition; $131 million of charges to selling, general and administrative expenses primarily for transaction costs related to the acquisition of Life Technologies; and $29 million of charges for pension settlements.
97745_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	employees at the date of acquisition and severance obligations to former executives and employees of Life Technologies.
97745_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	In addition, the company s other businesses incurred costs for continued headcount reductions and facility consolidations in an effort to streamline operations, including severance at several businesses and abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated, including the consolidation of operations within several facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia.
97745_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	The restructuring actions for which charges were incurred in 2014 resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $120 million beginning in part in 2014 and to a greater extent in 2015, including $80 million in the Life Sciences Solutions segment, $10 million in the Analytical Instruments segment, $10 million in the Specialty Diagnostics segment and $20 million in the Laboratory Products and Services segment.
97745_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 3% to $3.82 billion in 2015 due primarily to productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies, offset in part by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange and strategic growth investments.
97745_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Sales in the Life Sciences Solutions segment increased $244 million to $4.44 billion in 2015 primarily due to the acquisition of Life Technologies, net of divestitures.
97745_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Had the acquisition of Life Technologies been completed at the beginning of 2013, revenues for the 2015 period would have decreased $25 million compared to pro forma 2014 revenues, including a decrease of $278 million due to the unfavorable effects of currency translation, offset in part by an increase of $213 million (5%) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and an increase of $40 million due to other acquisitions, net of dispositions.
97745_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	The increase in pro forma revenue at existing businesses was primarily due to increased demand for bioprocess production products as well as biosciences products.

97745_17_ITEM15_P48_S5	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

97745_17_ITEM15_P49_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
97745_17_ITEM15_P49_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

97745_17_ITEM15_P125_S2	The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings.
97745_17_ITEM15_P125_S3	Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
97745_17_ITEM15_P126_S0	Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.
97745_17_ITEM15_P126_S1	The components of stock-based compensation expense are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P127_S0	The company has elected to recognize any excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vestings in capital in excess of par value only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to the company.

97745_17_ITEM15_P129_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_17_ITEM15_P129_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_17_ITEM15_P129_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_17_ITEM15_P130_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_17_ITEM15_P131_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.

97745_17_ITEM15_P131_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_17_ITEM15_P131_S3	The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.
97745_17_ITEM15_P132_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_17_ITEM15_P133_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_17_ITEM15_P134_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P135_S0	The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 were $24.54 , $27.04 and $26.89 , respectively.
97745_17_ITEM15_P135_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $176 million , $181 million and $208 million , respectively.
97745_17_ITEM15_P136_S0	The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.

97745_17_ITEM15_P137_S3	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2020 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.2 years .
97745_17_ITEM15_P138_S0	Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock.
97745_17_ITEM15_P138_S1	The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years , assuming continued employment, with some exceptions.
97745_17_ITEM15_P138_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_17_ITEM15_P139_S0	value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_17_ITEM15_P139_S1	Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents.
97745_17_ITEM15_P139_S2	The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.

97745_17_ITEM15_P148_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the funded status for the plans are based upon information available as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P149_S0	The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension benefit cost (income) are based upon information available as of the beginning of the year, as presented in the following table:
97745_17_ITEM15_P150_S0	The ultimate healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans are expected to be reached between 2017 and 2033 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P151_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_17_ITEM15_P151_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_17_ITEM15_P152_S0	As of January 1, 2017, the company changed the method it uses to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_17_ITEM15_P152_S1	Historically, the company estimated these service and interest cost components utilizing the single weighted-average discount rate used to measure each plan's benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.
97745_17_ITEM15_P152_S2	Beginning in 2017, the company will utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM15_P152_S3	The company has made this change to provide a more precise measurement of the service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates.
97745_17_ITEM15_P152_S4	The company has accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and will account for it prospectively starting in January 2017.
97745_17_ITEM15_P152_S5	The reduction in service and interest costs for 2017 associated with this change in estimate will be approximately $10 million .
97745_17_ITEM15_P153_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_17_ITEM15_P153_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_17_ITEM15_P153_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_17_ITEM15_P154_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.
97745_17_ITEM15_P155_S0	The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management s expectations of future salary increases.
97745_17_ITEM15_P156_S0	The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2017 are not material.
97745_17_ITEM15_P157_S0	The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P158_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P159_S0	The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.
97745_17_ITEM15_P160_S0	The net periodic pension benefit cost (income) includes the following components:
97745_17_ITEM15_P161_S0	The net periodic postretirement benefit cost was not material in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P162_S0	The company offered to settle pension obligations for former employee participants in certain defined benefit plans in 2014.
97745_17_ITEM15_P162_S1	The company recorded a charge of $30 million in 2014 associated with those plan participants electing to accept the settlement offer.
97745_17_ITEM15_P163_S0	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P163_S1	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_17_ITEM15_P163_S2	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P164_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2016 would not have caused a material change in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 and the 2016 aggregate of service and interest costs.
97745_17_ITEM15_P165_S0	The company s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates.
97745_17_ITEM15_P165_S1	The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility.
97745_17_ITEM15_P165_S2	The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities.
97745_17_ITEM15_P165_S3	The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 1% of invested assets) of private equity investments.
97745_17_ITEM15_P165_S4	The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 27% to funds investing in U.S. equities, including a sub-allocation of approximately 1% to real estate-related equities, approximately 25% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 48% to funds investing in fixed income securities.
97745_17_ITEM15_P165_S5	The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_17_ITEM15_P166_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM15_P166_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_17_ITEM15_P166_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_17_ITEM15_P167_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_17_ITEM15_P167_S1	For plans not currently managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments are substantially limited to funds investing in global equities and fixed income securities with target asset allocations of approximately 70% for equities and 30% for fixed income securities and cash.
97745_17_ITEM15_P167_S2	For plans managing the assets in a liability framework, the investments also include hedge funds, multi-asset funds and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 0% - 25% for equities, 33% - 100% for fixed income, 0% - 20% for hedge funds, 0% - 3% for multi-asset funds and 0% - 20% for funds holding derivatives.
97745_17_ITEM15_P167_S3	The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions.
97745_17_ITEM15_P167_S4	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_17_ITEM15_P168_S0	The fair values of the company s plan assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , by asset category are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P169_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12 ).
97745_17_ITEM15_P169_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured at net asset value per share and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_17_ITEM15_P169_S2	Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
97745_17_ITEM15_P169_S3	The fair value amounts of these investments presented in the above tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension plan assets.
97745_17_ITEM15_P169_S4	These investments were also redeemable at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_17_ITEM15_P170_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P171_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P172_S0	The company receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_17_ITEM15_P172_S1	The provision for income taxes that is currently payable does not reflect $53 million , $63 million and $65 million of such benefits that have been allocated to capital in excess of par value in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
97745_17_ITEM15_P173_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S0	The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S1	All of these countries except one have a lower tax rate than the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S2	The countries in which the company has a material presence that have significantly lower tax rates than the U.S. include Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S3	The company s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S4	The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S5	In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S6	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S7	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016 ).
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S8	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S9	In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S10	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S11	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2015).
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S12	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_17_ITEM15_P174_S13	Also in 2015, the company recorded benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_17_ITEM15_P175_S0	In 2014, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM15_P175_S1	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM15_P175_S2	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $172 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $55 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2014).
97745_17_ITEM15_P176_S0	The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives.
97745_17_ITEM15_P176_S1	The local taxing authority granted the company pioneer company status which provides an incentive encouraging companies to undertake activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore.
97745_17_ITEM15_P177_S0	In 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , the impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rates by 1.1% , 1.1% and 1.6% , respectively, and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 , $0.05 and $0.08 , respectively.
97745_17_ITEM15_P178_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_17_ITEM15_P179_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized.
97745_17_ITEM15_P179_S1	At December 31, 2016 , all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_17_ITEM15_P179_S2	At December 31, 2016 , the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $246 million , $1.44 billion and $2.38 billion , respectively.
97745_17_ITEM15_P180_S0	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM15_P180_S1	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2017 through 2036 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P180_S2	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $369 million expire in the years 2017 through 2036 , and the remainder do not expire.
97745_17_ITEM15_P180_S3	The company also had $620 million of federal foreign tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2016 , which expire in the years 2017 through 2026 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P181_S0	The company operates in various jurisdictions around the world.
97745_17_ITEM15_P181_S1	With the exception of its Affymetrix Singapore subsidiary, the company has not provided income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries due to its intention to permanently reinvest such earnings unless the company can remit such earnings to the U.S. without associated net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM15_P181_S2	The company recorded a deferred tax liability of $156 million in acquisition accounting for the outside basis difference of Affymetrix Singapore as the company intends to integrate it with the company s existing Singapore operations within the next twelve months.
97745_17_ITEM15_P181_S3	Aside from this plan, the company s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost.
97745_17_ITEM15_P181_S4	A provision has not been made for U.S. or additional non-U.S. taxes on $12.49 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S.
97745_17_ITEM15_P181_S5	It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized tax liability due to i) the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used (among several possibilities) should a decision be made to repatriate; ii) the availability and the complexity of calculating foreign tax credits; and iii) the implications of indirect taxes, including withholding taxes that could potentially be required depending on the repatriation structure.
97745_17_ITEM15_P181_S6	Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2016 , the company had $802 million of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_17_ITEM15_P182_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S0	During 2016, the company s unrecognized tax benefits increased $342 million due to the uncertainty around the deductibility of a foreign exchange loss on intercompany investments, $54 million due to acquisitions, $43 million due to tax planning related to prior years that resulted in amended tax filings, $35 million relating to foreign tax positions and $14 million due to the utilization of deferred tax assets.
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S1	In 2016, the company also settled the Life Technologies tax audit for the 2012 to 2014 tax years which reduced the reserve on unrecognized tax benefits by $10 million .
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S2	Of the total $802 million of liability, $3 million is classified as a current liability and the remainder is long-term.
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S3	During 2015, the company s unrecognized tax benefits increased $70 million due to the utilization of deferred tax assets and $28 million relating to foreign net operating losses on which the company has a deferred tax asset established.
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S4	This increase was offset in part by a reduction of $10 million from a resolution of an IRS audit of Life Technologies for which a reserve had previously been established.
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S5	During 2014, the company acquired Life Technologies which resulted in an increase in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $54 million .
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S6	The liability also increased due to the provision of tax reserves, primarily related to the sale of the divested businesses and a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction.
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S7	During 2014, the company settled the IRS audit relating to the 2010 and 2011 tax years which resulted in a decrease in the company s liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $48 million .
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S8	The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
97745_17_ITEM15_P183_S9	The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $24 million and $19 million , respectively.
97745_17_ITEM15_P184_S0	The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.
97745_17_ITEM15_P184_S1	In the normal course of business, the company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.
97745_17_ITEM15_P184_S2	With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2011.
97745_17_ITEM15_P185_S0	Options to purchase 1.5 million , 3.4 million and 2.4 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, because their effect would have been antidilutive.
97745_17_ITEM15_P186_S0	The effective interest rates for the fixed-rate debt include the stated interest on the notes, the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium, the amortization of any debt issuance costs and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.
97745_17_ITEM15_P186_S1	See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company s long-term obligations.
97745_17_ITEM15_P187_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the annual repayment requirements for debt obligations are as follows:
97745_17_ITEM15_P188_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , short-term obligations and current maturities of long-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet included $953 million and $50 million , respectively, of commercial paper, short-term bank borrowings and borrowings under lines of credit of certain of the company s subsidiaries.
97745_17_ITEM15_P188_S1	The weighted average interest rate for short-term borrowings was 0.15% and 1.14% at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
97745_17_ITEM15_P188_S2	In addition to available borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreements, discussed below, the company had unused lines of credit of $67 million as of December 31, 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P188_S3	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_17_ITEM15_P188_S4	In July 2016, the company replaced its existing revolving credit facility with a new facility with a bank group that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_17_ITEM15_P188_S5	The facility expires in July 2021 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P189_S0	The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in Euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_17_ITEM15_P189_S1	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_17_ITEM15_P189_S2	The financial covenants require the company to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) below 4.5 to 1.0 for the first two consecutive quarters after the closing date of the acquisition of FEI (see Note 2), stepping down to 4.0 to 1.0 for the two immediately following fiscal quarters and then stepping down to 3.5 to 1.0 each fiscal quarter thereafter.
97745_17_ITEM15_P189_S3	The agreement also requires the company to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) to interest expense of 3.0 to 1.0.
97745_17_ITEM15_P190_S0	The credit agreement permits the company to use the facility for working capital; acquisitions; repurchases of common stock, debentures and other securities; the refinancing of debt; and general corporate purposes.
97745_17_ITEM15_P190_S1	The credit agreement allows for the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the amount available for borrowing.
97745_17_ITEM15_P190_S2	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_17_ITEM15_P190_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , no borrowings were outstanding under the facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $72 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_17_ITEM15_P191_S0	The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes).
97745_17_ITEM15_P191_S1	Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment.
97745_17_ITEM15_P191_S2	Under the euro program, maturities may not exceed 183 days and may be denominated in euro, U.S. dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds sterling, Swiss franc, Canadian dollars or other currencies.
97745_17_ITEM15_P191_S3	Under both programs, the CP Notes are issued at a discount from par (or premium to par, in the case of negative interest rates), or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis.
97745_17_ITEM15_P191_S4	As of December 31, 2016 , outstanding borrowings under these programs were $953 million , with a weighted average remaining period to maturity of 58 days and are classified as short-term obligations in the accompanying balance sheet.
97745_17_ITEM15_P192_S0	In connection with the acquisition of FEI, the company entered into a term loan agreement.
97745_17_ITEM15_P192_S1	The term loan agreement is a 3-year unsecured $2.00 billion term loan facility.
97745_17_ITEM15_P192_S2	The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn under the term loan in Euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.

97745_17_ITEM15_P203_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_17_ITEM15_P203_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.
97745_17_ITEM15_P203_S2	However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.

97745_17_ITEM15_P204_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_17_ITEM15_P204_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_17_ITEM15_P205_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_17_ITEM15_P205_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_17_ITEM15_P205_S2	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_17_ITEM15_P205_S3	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_17_ITEM15_P205_S4	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_17_ITEM15_P206_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.
97745_17_ITEM15_P207_S0	In connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, the company often makes representations affirming, among other things, that its products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and agrees to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement.

97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S0	The company is currently involved in various stages of investigation and remediation related to environmental matters.
97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S2	Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented.
97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S3	The company records accruals for environmental remediation liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S4	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S5	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S6	At December 31, 2016 , the company s total environmental liability was approximately $49 million .
97745_17_ITEM15_P208_S7	While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM15_P209_S0	Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues.
97745_17_ITEM15_P209_S1	The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters.
97745_17_ITEM15_P209_S2	A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
97745_17_ITEM15_P210_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_17_ITEM15_P210_S1	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_17_ITEM15_P210_S2	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_17_ITEM15_P210_S3	Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_17_ITEM15_P210_S4	The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.
97745_17_ITEM15_P211_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.
97745_17_ITEM15_P211_S1	The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below , nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters.
97745_17_ITEM15_P211_S2	It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
97745_17_ITEM15_P211_S3	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2016 , was approximately $251 million to $397 million on an undiscounted basis.
97745_17_ITEM15_P212_S0	portion of these liabilities assumed in the 2006 merger with Fisher was recorded at its fair (present) value at the date of merger.

97745_17_ITEM15_P212_S2	The accrual includes estimated defense costs and is gross of estimated amounts due from insurers of $97 million at December 31, 2016 (or $114 million undiscounted) that are included in other assets in the accompanying balance sheet.
97745_17_ITEM15_P212_S3	The portion of these insurance assets assumed in the merger with Fisher was also recorded at its fair value at the date of merger.

97745_17_ITEM15_P213_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the Fisher merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67% ).
97745_17_ITEM15_P213_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $26 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $17 million (net discount $9 million ) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_17_ITEM15_P214_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_17_ITEM15_P215_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_17_ITEM15_P215_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.
97745_17_ITEM15_P215_S2	Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.

97745_17_ITEM15_P224_S2	In June 2013, in anticipation of the acquisition of Life Technologies, the company entered into equity forward agreements.
97745_17_ITEM15_P224_S3	The use of the equity forward agreements substantially eliminated future equity market price risk by fixing a common equity offering sales price under the then existing market conditions, while mitigating share dilution from the offering by postponing the actual issuance of common stock until the funds were needed for the Life Technologies acquisition.
97745_17_ITEM15_P224_S4	Upon settlement of the agreements, in January 2014, the company issued and delivered 29.6 million shares of its common stock at the then applicable forward sale price of $82.5342 per share.

97745_17_ITEM15_P225_S1	The company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock until the agreements were settled.
97745_17_ITEM15_P225_S2	Upon settlement, the proceeds were recorded in equity.
97745_17_ITEM15_P225_S3	Prior to their settlement, to the extent that the equity forward agreements were dilutive, they have been reflected in the company s diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method.
97745_17_ITEM15_P225_S4	Prior to closing, the subscription agreement was not potentially dilutive to the company s diluted earnings per share calculations due to its contingent nature.
97745_17_ITEM15_P226_S0	The company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during 2016 .
97745_17_ITEM15_P226_S1	The company s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of insurance contracts, investments in money market funds, derivative contracts, mutual funds holding publicly traded securities and other investments in unit trusts held as assets to satisfy outstanding deferred compensation and retirement liabilities; and acquisition-related contingent consideration.
97745_17_ITEM15_P226_S2	The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access.
97745_17_ITEM15_P226_S3	Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.
97745_17_ITEM15_P226_S4	Level 3: Inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.
97745_17_ITEM15_P227_S0	The following tables present information about the company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 :
97745_17_ITEM15_P228_S0	The company determines the fair value of its insurance contracts by obtaining the cash surrender value of the contracts from the issuer.
97745_17_ITEM15_P228_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates.
97745_17_ITEM15_P228_S2	The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on assessment of the probability that the company would be required to make such future payment.

97745_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	Raw Materials Our management team believes that we have a readily available supply of raw materials for all of our significant products from various sources.
97745_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	We do not anticipate any difficulties obtaining the raw materials essential to our business.
97745_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Raw material and fuel prices are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions.
97745_18_ITEM1_P70_S1	We employ many strategies, including the use of alternative materials, to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations on our results.
97745_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	Patents, Licenses and Trademarks Patents are important in many aspects of our business.
97745_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important, however, that its loss would significantly affect our operations as a whole.
97745_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for inventions and developments made by our personnel that are incorporated into our products or otherwise fall within our fields of interest.
97745_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Patent rights resulting from work sponsored by outside parties do not always accrue exclusively to the company and may be limited by agreements or contracts.
97745_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	We protect some of our technology as trade secrets and, where appropriate, we use trademarks or register trademarks used in connection with products.
97745_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how.
97745_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Seasonal Influences Revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to the capital spending patterns of industrial, pharmaceutical and government customers.
97745_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Sales of flu tests and related diagnostic products vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period s flu season.
97745_18_ITEM1_P75_S1	Sales of allergy tests vary quarter to quarter and year to year based on the severity and duration of each period s airborne pollen allergens.
97745_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.
97745_18_ITEM1_P76_S1	Dependency on a Single Customer There is no single customer the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_18_ITEM1_P76_S2	No customer accounted for more than 5% of our total revenues in any of the past three years.
97745_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	Backlog Our backlog of firm orders at year-end 2017 and 2016 was as follows:
97745_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	We believe that virtually all of our backlog at the end of 2017 will be filled during 2018 .
97745_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	Although the company transacts business with various government agencies, no government contract is of such magnitude that a renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government agency would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results.
97745_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	The company encounters aggressive and able competition in virtually all of the markets we serve.
97745_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	Because of the diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competitors and competition.
97745_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	Our competitors include a broad range of manufacturers and third-party distributors.
97745_18_ITEM1_P80_S3	Competitive climates in many of the markets we serve are characterized by changing technology and customer demands that require continuing research and development.
97745_18_ITEM1_P80_S4	Our success primarily depends on the following factors:
97745_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	relative prices of our products and services.
97745_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	Environmental Matters We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries.
97745_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	U.S. federal environmental legislation that affects us includes the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
97745_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters.
97745_18_ITEM1_P82_S3	The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an effect on our operations.
97745_18_ITEM1_P82_S4	In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes as well as having authority over these matters under state laws.
97745_18_ITEM1_P82_S5	Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements.
97745_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	A number of our operations involve the handling, manufacturing, use or sale of substances that are or could be classified as toxic or hazardous materials within the meaning of applicable laws.
97745_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	Consequently, some risk of environmental harm is inherent in our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.
97745_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	Our expenses for environmental requirements are incurred generally for ongoing compliance and historical remediation matters.
97745_18_ITEM1_P83_S3	Based on current information, we believe that these compliance costs are not material.
97745_18_ITEM1_P83_S4	For historical remediation obligations, our expenditures relate primarily to the cost of permitting, installing, and operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial measures.
97745_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	Our Fair Lawn and Somerville, New Jersey facilities entered into administrative consent orders with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in 1984 to maintain groundwater-remediation activities at these sites, and are currently under the State s Licensed Site Remediation Professional Program.
97745_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	As the owner of the Fair Lawn facility, we are listed as a potentially responsible party for remediation within an area called the Fair Lawn Wellfields Superfund Site, and, in 2008, the company and certain other parties entered into a consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to complete a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study.
97745_18_ITEM1_P84_S2	In 2011, our Life Technologies subsidiary entered into a consent decree with the USEPA and other responsible parties to implement a groundwater remedy at the former Davis Landfill Superfund site in Smithfield, Rhode Island.
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	We record accruals for environmental liabilities based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	We calculate estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	We include in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S3	Accrued liabilities for environmental matters totaled $52 million at December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S4	These environmental liabilities do not include third-party recoveries to which we may be entitled.
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S5	We believe that our accrual is adequate for the environmental liabilities we currently expect to incur.
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S6	As a result we believe that our ultimate liability with respect to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM1_P85_S7	However, we may be subject to remedial or compliance costs due to future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies, changes in the conduct of our operations, and the effect of changes in accounting rules, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	Our operations, and some of the products we offer, are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production, handling, transportation and distribution of chemicals, drugs and other similar products, including the operating and security standards of the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and various state boards of pharmacy as well as comparable state and foreign agencies.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	As Thermo Fisher s businesses also include export and import activities, we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the U.S. Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S2	In addition, our logistics activities must comply with the rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration and similar foreign agencies.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S3	While we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S4	To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S5	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S6	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S7	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_18_ITEM1_P86_S8	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	Number of Employees We have approximately 70,000 employees.
97745_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	Financial Information About Geographic Areas Financial information about geographic areas is summarized in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements , which begin on page F-1 of this report.

97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in Item 1.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Business under the caption "Forward-looking Statements".
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	We must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	We sell our products in several industries that are characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Competitive factors include technological innovation, price, service and delivery, breadth of product line, customer support, e-business capabilities and the ability to meet the special requirements of customers.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S7	Our competitors may adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customers requirements than we can.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S8	Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will likely become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S9	Many of our existing products and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing-process levels.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S10	Our customers use many of our products to develop, test and manufacture their own products.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S11	As a result, we must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S12	If we fail to adequately predict our customers needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S13	It may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S14	Some of the markets in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several years.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P0_S15	To address this issue, we are pursuing a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:
97745_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	continuing the development of commercial tools and infrastructure to increase and support cross-selling opportunities of products and services to take advantage of our depth in product offerings.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our business is affected by general economic conditions and related uncertainties affecting markets in which we operate.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	creating longer sales cycles and greater difficulty in collecting sales proceeds.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Demand for some of our products depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our customers include pharmaceutical and chemical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	As a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	International markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	These fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	As a multinational corporation, our businesses occasionally invoice third-party customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business (the "functional currency").
97745_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As our international sales grow, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In 2017 , currency translation had a favorable effect of $70 million on revenues due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Significant developments stemming from the U.S. administration or the U.K. s referendum on membership in the EU could have an adverse effect on us.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and has raised the possibility of imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly from China and Mexico.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The administration has also indicated an intention to request Congress to make significant changes, replacement or elimination of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and government negotiation/regulation of drug prices paid by government programs.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additionally, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum and voted in favor of leaving the European Union, or EU.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	This referendum has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty, and perhaps longer, by the impact of the United Kingdom s referendum.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	In addition, our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the United Kingdom.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	These possible negative impacts, and others resulting from the United Kingdom s actual or threatened withdrawal from the EU, may adversely affect our operating results and our customers businesses.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable products and obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Our Life Technologies subsidiary is party to several lawsuits in which plaintiffs claim we infringe their intellectual property (Note 10 ).
97745_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S7	For example, many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Changes in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Our pharma services offerings are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely offerings to our customers, our business could suffer.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our pharma services offerings are highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict quality and regulatory requirements.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Our operating results in this business depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our quality management strategy and systems, and our ability to effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S12	A failure of our quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of products.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S13	In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S15	In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P15_S16	Any such failure could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug product, registered intermediates, registered starting materials, and active pharmaceutical ingredients, other customer claims, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials for such manufacturing is often high.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product are not discovered before such product is released to the market, we may be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, such problems or failures could subject us to litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to product and other liability risks for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that products or services we have provided from our pharma services offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Additionally, products currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instruments and radiation measurement and security instruments businesses include fixed and portable instruments used for chemical, radiation and trace explosives detection.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	These products are used in airports, embassies, cargo facilities, border crossings and other high-threat facilities for the detection and prevention of terrorist acts.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If any of these products were to malfunction, it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product, which could lead to product liability claims.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	There are also many other factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims, such as the reliability and competence of the customers operators and the training of such operators.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Any such product liability claims brought against us could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Although we carry product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms, if at all.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Our inability to complete any pending acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	a number of reasons, including the need for antitrust and/or other regulatory approvals.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Further, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses, make such businesses profitable, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from these acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Moreover, we have acquired many companies and businesses.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily tradenames) on our balance sheet, which amount to approximately $25.29 billion and $1.27 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, we have definite-lived intangible assets totaling $15.41 billion as of December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We assess the realizability of definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	These cash flows in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these businesses.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Because we compete directly with certain of our larger customers and product suppliers, our results of operations could be adversely affected in the short term if these customers or suppliers abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with us.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our largest customer in the laboratory products business is also a significant competitor.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customers results in a discontinuation of their purchases from us.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, we manufacture products that compete directly with products that we source from third-party suppliers.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	We also source competitive products from multiple suppliers.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third-party suppliers abruptly discontinues selling products to us.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Because we rely heavily on third-party package-delivery services, a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies, such as Federal Express in the U.S. and DHL in Europe.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	We also maintain a small fleet of vehicles dedicated to the delivery of our products and ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	If one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S10	In addition, if one or more of these third-party package-delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S11	We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S12	We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (the FDA), the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the DEA), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS), the European Medicines Agency (the EMA), in Europe, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S13	In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P25_S14	Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The manufacture, distribution and marketing of many of our products and services, including medical devices and pharma services, are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and non-U.S. regulatory authorities.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities, including without limitation, remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims, contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs, any or all of which could be significant.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We are the sole manufacturer of a number of pharmaceuticals for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers' ability to provide products to their customers.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous, and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products, pending sale.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Any significant disruption of those operations for any reason, such as strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, fire, hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We have significant operations in California, near major earthquake faults, which make us susceptible to earthquake risk.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers, our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price, we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	As a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country, changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We may incur unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices, which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Our primary commodity exposures are for fuel, petroleum-based resins and steel.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases through higher prices to customers and various cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	As a part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software applications to manage certain of our business operations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Such problems could disrupt our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate pricing and cost data our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We also rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide services and support to customers, track customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized access to customer or employee data or company trade secrets, and other attempts to harm our systems.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Certain of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	which could harm our reputation and financial results.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Any of the cyber-attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above, if significant, could materially interrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in theft of our and our customers intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer, business partner and employee relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased cost for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our debt may restrict our investment opportunities or limit our activities.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $21.01 billion in outstanding indebtedness.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, we have availability to borrow under a revolving credit facility that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We may also obtain additional long-term debt and lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Our ability to make scheduled payments, refinance our obligations or obtain additional financing will depend on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S6	Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S7	If we are unable to service our debt, refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay strategic acquisitions, capital expenditures or research and development expenditures.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S8	Additionally, the agreements governing our debt require that we maintain certain financial ratios, and contain affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our activities by, among other limitations, limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other entities, make investments, create liens, sell assets and enter into transactions with affiliates.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S9	The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S10	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.0 :1.0 for the first and second quarters of 2018 and then stepping down to 3.5 :1.0 for the third quarter of 2018 and thereafter.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S11	The company has also agreed that so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility or any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.0 :1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S12	Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S13	Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.
97745_18_ITEM1A_P33_S14	Also, an acceleration of the debt under certain of our debt instruments would trigger an event of default under other of our debt instruments.
97745_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The location and general character of our principal properties by segment are as follows: Life Sciences Solutions We own approximately 2.3 million square feet of office, engineering, laboratory and production space, principally in California, New York, Maryland, Illinois, Oregon, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, within the U.S., and in the U.K., Lithuania and New Zealand.

97745_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Reference is made throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which begin on page F-1 of this report.
97745_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Overview The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide.
97745_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	The company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses.
97745_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	The company s continuing operations fall into four business segments (see Note 3 ): Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services.
97745_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	The company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	The company s principal recent acquisitions are described below.
97745_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	In February 2015, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Advanced Scientifics, Inc., a North America-based global provider of single-use systems and process equipment for bioprocess production, for approximately $289 million .
97745_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	The acquisition expanded the company s bioprocessing offerings.
97745_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	Revenues of Advanced Scientifics were approximately $80 million in 2014.
97745_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	On September 30, 2015, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Alfa Aesar, a U.K.-based global manufacturer of research chemicals from Johnson Matthey Plc, for 257 million ( $393 million ) in cash.
97745_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The acquisition expanded the company s existing portfolio of chemicals, solvents and reagents.
97745_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	Revenues of Alfa Aesar were approximately 78 million in 2014.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	On March 31, 2016, the company acquired, primarily within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Affymetrix, Inc., a North America-based provider of cellular and genetic analysis products, for a total purchase price of $1.34 billion , net of cash acquired, including the assumption of $254 million of debt.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	The acquisition expanded the company's existing portfolio of antibodies and assays for flow cytometry and single-cell biology applications.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additionally, the acquisition expanded the company's genetic analysis portfolio through the addition of microarrays.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	Revenues of Affymetrix were $360 million in 2015.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	On September 19, 2016, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, FEI Company, a North America-based provider of high-performance electron microscopy, for a total purchase price of $4.08 billion , net of cash acquired.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	The acquisition strengthened the company's analytical instrument portfolio with the addition of high-end electron microscopes.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S6	Revenues of FEI were $930 million in 2015.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S7	On February 14, 2017, the company acquired, within the Life Sciences Solutions segment, Finesse Solutions, Inc., a North America-based developer of scalable control automation systems and software for bioproduction, for a total purchase price of $221 million , net of cash acquired.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S8	The acquisition expanded the company's bioproduction offerings.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S9	Revenues of Finesse Solutions were approximately $50 million in 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S10	On March 2, 2017, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, Core Informatics, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management, for a total purchase price of $94 million , net of cash acquired.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S11	The acquisition enhanced the company's existing informatics solutions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P4_S12	Revenues of Core Informatics were approximately $10 million in 2016.
97745_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	On August 29, 2017, the company acquired, within the Laboratory Products and Services segment, substantially all of the issued and outstanding shares of Patheon N.V., a leading global provider of high-quality drug development and delivery solutions to the pharmaceutical and biopharma sectors, for $35.00 per share in cash, or $7.36 billion , including the assumption of net debt.
97745_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	The company financed the purchase price, including the repayment of indebtedness of Patheon, with issuances of debt and equity.
97745_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Patheon provides comprehensive, integrated and highly customizable solutions as well as the expertise to help biopharmaceutical companies of all sizes satisfy complex development and manufacturing needs.
97745_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company's existing pharmaceutical services portfolio.
97745_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	Patheon's revenues totaled $1.87 billion for the year ended October 31, 2016.
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	Sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion , an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Sales increased $1.63 billion due to acquisitions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $70 million in 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million ( 5% ) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew.
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	Sales growth was moderate in North America and Europe and particularly strong in Asia.
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	In 2017 , total company operating income and operating income margin were $2.97 billion and 14.2% , respectively, compared with $2.45 billion and 13.4% , respectively, in 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S7	The increase in operating income was primarily due to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by an increase in amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, due to recent acquisitions, and strategic growth investments.
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S8	The company s references to strategic growth investments generally refer to targeted spending for enhancing commercial capabilities, including expansion of geographic sales reach and e-commerce platforms, marketing initiatives, focused research projects and other expenditures to enhance the customer experience.
97745_18_ITEM7_P7_S9	The company s references throughout this discussion to productivity improvements generally refer to improved cost efficiencies from its Practical Process Improvement (PPI) business system, reduced costs resulting from global sourcing initiatives, a lower cost structure following restructuring actions, including headcount reductions and consolidation of facilities, and low cost region manufacturing.
97745_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) , consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction.
97745_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Although the net $204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in Note 7.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	In addition, in 2017 the company recorded a $65 million favorable adjustment to deferred tax balances due to extension of a tax holiday agreement in Singapore and $65 million of benefit associated with new required accounting for tax benefits from equity awards, as discussed in Note 1.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S4	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S5	The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S6	The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S7	The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S8	Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S9	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S10	The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S11	In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S12	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM7_P9_S13	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million , offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million .
97745_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
97745_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	The effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
97745_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
97745_18_ITEM7_P10_S5	The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Income from continuing operations increased to $2.23 billion in 2017 , from $2.03 billion in 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase in operating income in 2017 (discussed above) was offset in part by an increase in interest expense of $123 million primarily due to increases in outstanding debt to fund acquisitions and the increase in the tax provision in 2017 (discussed above).
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	During 2017 , the company s cash flow from operations totaled $4.01 billion compared with $3.26 billion for 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increase primarily resulted from higher income before amortization and depreciation in the 2017 period and lower investment in working capital in 2017.
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , the company s short-term debt totaled $2.14 billion , including $0.96 billion of commercial paper obligations and $1.17 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months.
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	As of December 31, 2017 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_18_ITEM7_P11_S8	The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion as of December 31, 2017 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
97745_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.
97745_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, business combinations, intangible assets and goodwill, sales returns, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, and pension costs.
97745_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.
97745_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable.
97745_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources.
97745_18_ITEM7_P12_S6	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	The company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
97745_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized.
97745_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses.
97745_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Definite-lived intangible assets totaled $15.41 billion at December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	The company reviews definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets.
97745_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset.
97745_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	The company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount.
97745_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	Events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions, economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts.
97745_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $25.29 billion and $1.27 billion , respectively, at December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth, asset-related expenditures, working capital levels and other factors.
97745_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
97745_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	For reporting units where the company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test, indications of fair value based on projections of profitability for 2018 and thereafter and on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of 2017 , the date of the company s impairment testing.
97745_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired.
97745_18_ITEM7_P18_S4	Should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment may be necessary.
97745_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	With the completion of the Patheon acquisition in August 2017, the company established a new reporting unit which solely consists of the legacy Patheon business, the book carrying value of which equaled its fair value as of the acquisition date.
97745_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	During its annual 2017 goodwill impairment assessment, the company performed a qualitative assessment of this reporting unit and determined that no events had occurred and no circumstances had changed that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.
97745_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	As a result, the company did not perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit.
97745_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	Given that the fair value of the reporting unit was not substantially in excess of its carrying value as of the annual 2017 assessment date, relatively small decreases in future cash flows from anticipated results could result in impairment of goodwill.
97745_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	The key variables that will drive the cash flows of the reporting unit will be levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the weighted average cost of capital rate applied.
97745_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The business unit consisting of the legacy Patheon business had $3.25 billion of goodwill, and an overall carrying value of $7.33 billion as of December 31, 2017.
97745_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	(b) Income Taxes In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date.
97745_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.
97745_18_ITEM7_P21_S3	For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM7_P21_S4	Should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit, the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes.
97745_18_ITEM7_P21_S5	The company s reserve for these matters totaled $1.41 billion at December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and, as a result, is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non-U.S. tax authorities, as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments.
97745_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events, such as the amount, timing and character of deductions, permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit, after consideration of all positive and negative evidence, and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	In situations in which the company has been able to conclude that its deferred tax assets will be realized, it has generally relied on future reversals of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income where such estimates have historically been reliable, and other factors.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	If it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used, the company reverses the related valuation allowance.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S4	Any such reversals are recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S5	The company s tax valuation allowance totaled $256 million at December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S6	Should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates, additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S7	The company has not provided state income or foreign withholding taxes on certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries undistributed earnings, as such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely in the respective jurisdictions based on specific business plans and tax strategies.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S8	These business plans and tax strategies consider: short-term and long-term forecasts and budgets of the U.S. parent and non-U.S. subsidiaries; working capital and other needs in locations where earnings are generated; the company s past practices regarding non-U.S. subsidiary dividends; sources of financing by the U.S. parent, such as issuing debt or equity; and uses of cash by the U.S. parent that are more discretionary in nature, such as business combinations and share repurchase programs.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S9	However, should the company change its business plans and tax strategies in the future and decide to repatriate a portion of these earnings to one of its U.S. subsidiaries, including cash maintained by these non-U.S. subsidiaries, the company would recognize additional U.S. tax liabilities.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S10	It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional state and foreign withholding tax liabilities that the company would incur.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S11	(c) Contingencies and Litigation The company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, and other claims that arise in the normal course of business.
97745_18_ITEM7_P24_S12	The accruals are based on management s judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates.
97745_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Accruals of acquired businesses, including product liability and environmental accruals, were initially recorded at fair value and discounted to their net present value.
97745_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable.
97745_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	(d) Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Several of the company s U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans.
97745_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	The cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working, the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease.
97745_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels.
97745_18_ITEM7_P26_S3	Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third-party actuaries, and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date.
97745_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled $25 million in 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled $486 million at year-end 2017 compared with $610 million at year-end 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation.
97745_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	For example, a 10% decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately $2 million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately $95 million .
97745_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	As of December 31, 2017 , the company expects to contribute between $35 and $65 million to its existing defined benefit pension plans in 2018 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Sales in 2017 were $20.92 billion , an increase of $2.64 billion from 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P28_S1	Sales increased $1.63 billion due to acquisitions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P28_S2	The favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of $70 million in 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	Aside from the effects of acquisitions and currency translation, revenues increased $949 million ( 5% ) primarily due to increased demand.
97745_18_ITEM7_P28_S4	Sales to customers in each of the company's primary end markets grew.

97745_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, principally associated with acquisition-related activities; restructuring and other costs/income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines; and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.
97745_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitate comparison of performance for determining compensation (Note 3 ).
97745_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Accordingly, the following segment data is reported on this basis.
97745_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Income from the company s reportable segments increased 15% to $4.86 billion in 2017 due primarily to profit on higher sales in local currencies, the effects of acquisitions and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, offset in part by strategic growth investments.

97745_18_ITEM7_P32_S4	The increase in operating margin resulted primarily from productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases, and, to a lesser extent, profit on higher sales in local currencies and price increases.
97745_18_ITEM7_P32_S5	These increases were offset in part by strategic growth investments and acquisition dilution.
97745_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Sales in the Analytical Instruments segment increased $1.15 billion to $4.82 billion in 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	Sales increased $794 million due to acquisitions, $330 million ( 9% ) due to higher revenues at existing businesses and $29 million due to the favorable effects of currency translation.

97745_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	Operating income margin was 21.3% in 2017 compared to 20.3% in 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P33_S4	The increase resulted primarily from profit on higher sales in local currencies, productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions, offset in part by strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable foreign currency exchange and unfavorable sales mix.
97745_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Sales in the Specialty Diagnostics segment increased $147 million to $3.49 billion in 2017 .

97745_18_ITEM7_P34_S3	Operating income margin was 26.7% in 2017 and 27.2% in 2016 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P34_S4	The decrease resulted primarily from strategic growth investments and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable sales mix, offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and productivity improvements, net of inflationary cost increases.

97745_18_ITEM7_P35_S4	The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable sales mix and strategic growth investments offset in part by profit on higher sales in local currencies and, to a lesser extent, the effect of acquisitions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P35_S5	Other Expense, Net The company reported other expense, net, of $539 million and $425 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively (Note 4 ).
97745_18_ITEM7_P35_S6	Interest expense increased $123 million primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt.
97745_18_ITEM7_P35_S7	Provision for Income Taxes The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was principally due to a net provision of $204 million from the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 , consisting primarily of a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, net of a benefit from adjusting the deferred tax balances for the U.S. statutory tax rate reduction.
97745_18_ITEM7_P35_S8	Although the net $204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, the components of the net charge are provisional and may change as discussed in Note 7.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	In 2017, the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes.

97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	The company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2017.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million, offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017) for a net benefit of $33 million.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S6	The company intends to make similar types of distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries when they can be made at no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S7	The ability of the company to make distributions in future periods of similar type and magnitude will depend on the level of earnings and cash flow in various foreign jurisdictions and on the applicable tax laws in effect at that time.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S8	Accordingly, the impact of foreign tax credits on the company s effective tax rate in future periods is likely to vary.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S9	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S10	The company recorded a benefit from income taxes in 2016.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S11	In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S12	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S13	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million , offset in part by additional U.S. taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016) for a net benefit of $54 million .
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S14	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S15	In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits in 2016 totaling $39 million related to prior year tax filings and net charges of $12 million related to tax audits.
97745_18_ITEM7_P36_S16	The effective tax rate in both 2017 and 2016 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $479 million and $663 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
97745_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	The company expects its effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 6% and 9% based on currently forecasted rates of profitability in the countries in which the company conducts business and expected generation of foreign tax credits.
97745_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	The effective tax rate can vary significantly from period to period as a result of discrete income tax factors and events.
97745_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S.
97745_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	Some of these countries have lower tax rates than the U.S.
97745_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	The company s ability to obtain a benefit from lower tax rates outside the U.S. is dependent on its relative levels of income in countries outside the U.S. and on the statutory tax rates in those countries.
97745_18_ITEM7_P37_S6	Based on the dispersion of the company s non-U.S. income tax provision among many countries, the company believes that a change in the statutory tax rate in any individual country is not likely to materially affect the company s income tax provision or net income, aside from any resulting one-time adjustment to the company s deferred tax balances to reflect a new rate.
97745_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	A description of recently issued accounting standards is included under the heading "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 1 .

97745_18_ITEM7_P47_S20	The foreign tax credits are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_18_ITEM7_P47_S21	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM7_P47_S22	In addition, the company recorded discrete benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_18_ITEM7_P47_S23	The tax provision in the 2015 period was favorably affected by $37 million as a result of adjustments to deferred tax balances due to changes in tax rates.
97745_18_ITEM7_P47_S24	The effective tax rate in both 2016 and 2015 was also affected by relatively significant earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P47_S25	Due primarily to the non-deductibility of intangible asset amortization for tax purposes, the company s cash payments for income taxes were higher than its income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and totaled $663 million and $477 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Consolidated working capital was $2.37 billion at December 31, 2017 , compared with $2.16 billion at December 31, 2016 .

97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	Cash provided by operating activities was $4.01 billion during 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	An increase in other liabilities provided cash of $1.02 billion primarily due to the Tax Act's one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S4	Given the availability of foreign tax credits, the company does not expect the transition tax to result in significant cash requirements.
97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S5	An increase in accounts payable provided cash of $274 million due to the timing of payments.
97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S6	Increases in accounts receivable and inventories used cash of $362 million and $81 million , respectively, primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies.
97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S7	An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of income tax refunds.
97745_18_ITEM7_P48_S8	Cash payments for income taxes decreased to $479 million during 2017 , compared with $663 million in 2016 .

97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S9	At February 28, 2018 , $500 million was available for future repurchases of the company s common stock under this authorization.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S10	In January 2018, the company issued additional commercial paper obligations and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the $450 million principal balance of the 2.15% Senior Notes due 2018.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S11	As of December 31, 2017 , the company s short-term debt totaled $2.14 billion , including $960 million of commercial paper obligations and $1.17 billion of senior notes due within the next twelve months.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S12	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S13	If the company borrows under this facility, it intends to leave undrawn an amount equivalent to outstanding commercial paper to provide a source of funds in the event that commercial paper markets are not available.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S14	As of December 31, 2017 , no borrowings were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S15	Approximately half of the company s cash balances and cash flows from operations are from outside the U.S.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S16	A portion of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that are permanently reinvested and which the company plans to use to support continued growth plans outside of the U.S. through funding operations and other investment and growth opportunities.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S17	The majority of these funds are only available for use by the company's U.S. operations if they are repatriated into the U.S.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S18	The funds repatriated would be subject to additional state and foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation; however, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax liabilities that would be incurred.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S19	The company currently has no plans to repatriate these funds held by its non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S20	The company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents of $1.34 billion as of December 31, 2017 and its future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its existing businesses for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 24 months.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S21	Cash provided by operating activities was $3.26 billion during 2016.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S22	An increase in accounts receivable used cash of $352 million primarily to support growth in sales in local currencies and due to the mid-month timing of the acquisition of FEI when receivables are commonly lower than at quarter-end.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S23	Inventories provided cash of $98 million due to a reduction associated with fourth quarter 2016 sales.
97745_18_ITEM7_P49_S24	An increase in other assets used cash of $153 million primarily due to the timing of payments.

97745_18_ITEM7_P52_S8	The amounts disclosed in the table below for letters of credit, bank guarantees, surety bonds and other guarantees relate to guarantees of the company s performance, primarily in the ordinary course of business.

97745_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.
97745_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	(c) Obligation represents funding commitments pursuant to investments held by the company.
97745_18_ITEM7_P54_S4	Reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.41 billion have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P54_S5	The company has no material commitments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, other than those included in the above table, but expects that for 2018 , such expenditures will be between $700 and $730 million .
97745_18_ITEM7_P54_S6	Guarantees of residual value under lease arrangements for three facilities have not been included in the above table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantees may require payment (see Note 10 ).
97745_18_ITEM7_P54_S7	The residual value guarantees become operative at the end of the leases for up to a maximum of $155 million .
97745_18_ITEM7_P54_S8	The initial terms of these leases end in 2019, 2020 and 2022, although renewal options exist for each.
97745_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	A guarantee of pension plan obligations of a divested business has not been included in the preceding table due to the inability to predict if and when the guarantee may require payment.
97745_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The purchaser of the divested business has agreed to pay for the pension benefits, however the company was required to guarantee payment of these pension benefits should the purchaser fail to do so.

97745_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	In disposing of assets or businesses, the company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and related legal fees.
97745_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	The company does not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions.
97745_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	However, the company has no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on its financial position, annual results of operations or cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The company has recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities.
97745_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Business Environmental Matters for a discussion of these liabilities.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates, which could affect its future results of operations and financial condition.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The company manages its exposure to these risks through its regular operating and financing activities.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The company has periodically hedged interest rate risks of fixed-rate instruments with offsetting interest rate swaps.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Additionally, the company uses short-term forward and option contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Such exposures result from purchases, sales, cash and intercompany loans that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Norwegian kroner, Swiss franc and Canadian dollars.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Income and losses arising from these derivative contracts are recognized as offsets to losses and income resulting from the underlying exposure being hedged.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The company does not enter into speculative derivative agreements.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Interest Rates The company is exposed to changes in interest rates while conducting normal business operations as a result of ongoing investing and financing activities, which affect the company s debt as well as cash and cash equivalents.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the company s debt portfolio was comprised primarily of fixed rate borrowings.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The fair market value of the company s fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S4	The total estimated fair value of the company s debt at December 31, 2017 was $21.62 billion (see Note 12 ).
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S5	Fair values were determined from available market prices using current interest rates and terms to maturity.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S6	If interest rates were to decrease by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company s debt at December 31, 2017 would increase by approximately $1.30 billion .
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S7	If interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points, the fair value of the company s debt at December 31, 2017 would decrease by approximately $1.20 billion .
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S8	In addition, interest rate changes would result in a change in the company s interest expense due to variable-rate debt instruments including swap arrangements.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P2_S9	In 2017 , a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on the swap arrangements and variable-rate debt would have increased the company s annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $44 million .
97745_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Currency Exchange Rates The company views its investment in international subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar as permanent.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The company s investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The functional currencies of the company s international subsidiaries are principally denominated in British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, euro, Canadian dollars, Danish kroner and Swiss franc.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The effect of a change in the period ending currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the "accumulated other comprehensive items" component of shareholders equity.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P3_S4	The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P3_S5	A 10% depreciation in year-end 2017 functional currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar, would result in a reduction of shareholders equity of $1.55 billion .
97745_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The fair value of forward currency-exchange contracts is the estimated amount that the company would pay or receive upon termination of the contract, taking into account the change in currency exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	A 10% depreciation in year-end 2017 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an unrealized gain on forward currency-exchange contracts of $130 million .
97745_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	A 10% appreciation in year-end 2017 non-functional currency exchange rates related to the company s contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized loss on forward currency-exchange contracts of $130 million .
97745_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The unrealized gains or losses on forward currency-exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the exposures being hedged.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Certain of the company s cash and cash equivalents are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the depositor and are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	A 10% depreciation in the related year-end 2017 non-functional currency exchange rates applied to such cash balances would result in a negative impact of $34 million on the company s net income.
97745_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	This data is submitted as a separate section to this report.
97745_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	The company s management, with the participation of the company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017 .

97745_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The company s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
97745_18_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on this assessment, the company s management concluded that, as of December 31, 2017 , the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
97745_18_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 , excluded Patheon N.V., which was acquired by the company in August 2017 in a purchase business combination.

97745_18_ITEM15_P83_S2	The company may bypass the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the goodwill impairment test.
97745_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	The company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using forecasts of discounted future cash flows and peer market multiples.
97745_18_ITEM15_P84_S1	The company would record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P84_S2	Prior to the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adoption of new guidance discussed elsewhere in Note 1 , if an impairment had been indicated, any excess of the carrying value over the implied fair value of goodwill would have been recorded as an operating loss.
97745_18_ITEM15_P84_S3	The company determined that no impairments existed in 2017 , 2016 or 2015 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:

97745_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks.
97745_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P89_S2	If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
97745_18_ITEM15_P89_S3	Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.
97745_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	The company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations.
97745_18_ITEM15_P90_S1	The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, British pounds sterling, Swedish kronor, Norwegian kroner, Swiss franc and Canadian dollars.

97745_18_ITEM15_P90_S3	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
97745_18_ITEM15_P90_S4	For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.
97745_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	During 2016, in connection with new debt issuances, the company entered into interest rate swap arrangements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	The company includes the gain or loss on the hedged items (fixed-rate debt) in the same line item (interest expense) as the offsetting effective portion of the loss or gain on the related interest rate swaps.
97745_18_ITEM15_P91_S2	The company also uses foreign currency-denominated debt to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P91_S3	The company s euro-denominated senior notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation.
97745_18_ITEM15_P91_S4	Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income and shareholders equity.
97745_18_ITEM15_P92_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
97745_18_ITEM15_P92_S1	In addition, significant estimates were made in estimating future cash flows to assess potential impairment of assets and in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets (Note 2 ) and the ultimate loss from abandoning leases at facilities being exited (Note 14 ).
97745_18_ITEM15_P92_S2	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P93_S0	In February 2018, the FASB issued new guidance to allow reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to retained earnings for certain tax effects on items within AOCI resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act).

97745_18_ITEM15_P93_S5	As discussed further in Note 7 , the company is reporting provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for which a reasonable estimate can be determined but for which the accounting impact may change based on further analysis regarding the amount and composition of the company's historical foreign earnings and future issuance of interpretive regulations.
97745_18_ITEM15_P93_S6	Adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period, which may be up to December 22, 2018, will be included as adjustments to Benefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes in the period the amounts are determined.

97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	In March 2017, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S3	The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic cost be reported in the same line item(s) as other employee compensation costs and all other components of the net periodic cost be reported in the income statement below operating income.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S4	The guidance is effective for the company in 2018.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S5	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S6	In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance that eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S7	Instead, the new guidance requires entities to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit s carrying amount over its fair value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S8	The company adopted this guidance when it performed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S9	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S10	In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the definition of a business and providing criteria to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not defined as a business.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S11	The new guidance requires such integrated sets to be defined as an asset (and not a business) if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S12	The guidance is effective for the company in 2018.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S13	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S14	In October 2016, the FASB issued new guidance eliminating the deferral of the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S15	The guidance is effective for the company in 2018.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S16	The impact of this guidance will be dependent on the extent of future asset transfers which usually occur in connection with planning around acquisitions and other business structuring activities.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S17	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S18	In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which affects the accounting for stock-based co mpensatio n.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S19	The new guidance simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S20	The company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2017 and applied the changes to the statement of cash flows retrospectively.
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S21	Adoption of this guidance decreased the company's tax provision in 2017 by $65 million and increased diluted earnings per share for the same period by $0.16 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P95_S22	The impact in future periods will be dependent upon changes in the company's stock price, the volume of employee stock option exercises and the timing of service- and performance-based restricted unit vesting.
97745_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which requires lessees to record most leases on their balance sheets as lease liabilities, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with corresponding right-of-use assets.
97745_18_ITEM15_P96_S1	The new guidance also sets forth new disclosure requirements related to leases.
97745_18_ITEM15_P96_S2	The company plans to adopt the guidance in 2019 using a modified retrospective method.
97745_18_ITEM15_P96_S3	The company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, however, assets and liabilities will increase upon adoption for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
97745_18_ITEM15_P96_S4	The company s future commitments under lease obligations are summarized in Note 10 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance which affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S1	This guidance retains the current accounting for classifying and measuring investments in debt securities and loans, but requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with subsequent changes recognized in net income, except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S2	The guidance also changes the accounting for investments without a readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient permitted by the guidance to estimate fair value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S3	A policy election can be made for these investments whereby estimated fair value may be measured at cost and adjusted in subsequent periods for any impairment or changes in observable prices of identical or similar investments.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S4	The guidance is effective for the company in 2018.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S5	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S6	In July 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S7	Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S8	This guidance does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first-out (LIFO).
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S9	The guidance was effective for the company in 2017.
97745_18_ITEM15_P97_S10	Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S0	The new standard also requires significantly expanded disclosures regarding the qualitative and quantitative information of an entity's nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	During 2016 and 2017, the FASB issued additional guidance and clarification, including the elimination of certain SEC Staff Guidance.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S2	The guidance is effective for the company in 2018.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S3	The company has elected to adopt this guidance through application of the modified retrospective method.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S4	The company substantially completed its analysis of the impact of the new guidance in 2017.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S5	Applying the new guidance to the majority of the company s revenue arrangements based on its most commonly used customer terms and conditions and routine sales transactions, which generally consist of a single performance obligation to transfer promised goods or services, does not have a material impact to the company s consolidated financial statements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S6	While the timing of revenue recognition for some of the company s other sales transactions has been affected by the new guidance, the impact is not expected to be material.
97745_18_ITEM15_P98_S7	The impact of recording the cumulative effect of the change in the accounting guidance in the company's balance sheet in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to be less than 1% of total assets, total liabilities, and total shareholders equity.
97745_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	The company s acquisitions have historically been made at prices above the determined fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets, resulting in goodwill, due to expectations of the synergies that will be realized by combining the businesses.
97745_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	These synergies include the elimination of redundant facilities, functions and staffing; use of the company s existing commercial infrastructure to expand sales of the acquired businesses products; and use of the commercial infrastructure of the acquired businesses to cost-effectively expand sales of company products.
97745_18_ITEM15_P99_S2	Acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and the acquired companies results have been included in the accompanying financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

97745_18_ITEM15_P101_S1	The acquisition provided entry into the pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization market and added a complementary service to the company's existing pharmaceutical services portfolio.
97745_18_ITEM15_P101_S2	Patheon's revenues totaled $1.87 billion for the year ended October 31, 2016.
97745_18_ITEM15_P101_S3	The purchase price exceeded the fair market value of the identifiable net assets and, accordingly, $3.26 billion was allocated to goodwill, $125 million of which is tax deductible.
97745_18_ITEM15_P101_S4	On March 2, 2017, the company acquired, within the Analytical Instruments segment, Core Informatics, a North America-based provider of cloud-based platforms supporting scientific data management, for a total purchase price of $94 million , net of cash acquired.

97745_18_ITEM15_P126_S0	The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others.
97745_18_ITEM15_P126_S1	These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer.
97745_18_ITEM15_P126_S2	The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vestings.
97745_18_ITEM15_P126_S3	Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
97745_18_ITEM15_P127_S0	Compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value and is recognized ratably over the requisite vesting period or to the date based on qualifying retirement eligibility, if earlier.
97745_18_ITEM15_P127_S1	The components of stock-based compensation expense are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P128_S0	The company measures the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock-based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P128_S1	The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes.
97745_18_ITEM15_P128_S2	Following the adoption of new guidance discussed in Note 1 , tax benefits recognized as a reduction of the income tax provision were $65 million in 2017.

97745_18_ITEM15_P129_S0	The company s practice is to grant stock options at fair market value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P129_S1	Options vest over 3 - 5 years with terms of 7 - 10 years, assuming continued employment with certain exceptions.
97745_18_ITEM15_P129_S2	Vesting of the option awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions.
97745_18_ITEM15_P130_S0	The fair value of most option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
97745_18_ITEM15_P130_S1	For option grants that require the achievement of both service and market conditions, a lattice model is used to estimate fair value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P130_S2	The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_18_ITEM15_P131_S0	Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs.
97745_18_ITEM15_P132_S0	Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the company s stock.
97745_18_ITEM15_P132_S1	Historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option.
97745_18_ITEM15_P132_S2	The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant.
97745_18_ITEM15_P132_S3	The expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing the company s annual dividend, based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the closing stock price on the grant date.
97745_18_ITEM15_P133_S0	The compensation expense recognized for all stock-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures.
97745_18_ITEM15_P134_S0	Forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
97745_18_ITEM15_P135_S0	The weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P136_S0	The weighted average per share grant-date fair values of options granted during 2017 , 2016 and 2015 were $30.73 , $24.54 and $27.04 , respectively.
97745_18_ITEM15_P136_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the same periods was $199 million , $176 million and $181 million , respectively.
97745_18_ITEM15_P137_S0	The intrinsic value is the difference between the market value of the shares on the exercise date and the exercise price of the option.
97745_18_ITEM15_P137_S1	A summary of the company s option activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 is presented below:
97745_18_ITEM15_P138_S0	(a) Market price per share on December 31, 2017 was $189.88 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P138_S1	The intrinsic value is zero for options with exercise prices above the market price.
97745_18_ITEM15_P138_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , there was $99 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted.
97745_18_ITEM15_P138_S3	The cost is expected to be recognized through 2021 with a weighted average amortization period of 2.6 years .
97745_18_ITEM15_P139_S0	Restricted Share/Unit Awards Awards of restricted units convert into an equivalent number of shares of common stock.
97745_18_ITEM15_P139_S1	The awards generally vest over 3 - 4 years , assuming continued employment, with some exceptions.
97745_18_ITEM15_P139_S2	Vesting of the awards is contingent upon meeting certain service conditions and may also be contingent upon meeting certain performance and/or market conditions.
97745_18_ITEM15_P139_S3	The fair market value of the award at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting period.
97745_18_ITEM15_P139_S4	Recipients of restricted units have no voting rights but are entitled to accrue dividend equivalents.
97745_18_ITEM15_P139_S5	The fair value of service- and performance-based restricted unit awards is determined based on the number of units granted and the market value of the company s shares on the grant date.
97745_18_ITEM15_P139_S6	For awards with market-based vesting conditions, the company uses a lattice model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the award.

97745_18_ITEM15_P144_S3	The costs of the postretirement healthcare programs are generally funded on a self-insured and insured-premium basis.
97745_18_ITEM15_P144_S4	The company recognizes the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability.
97745_18_ITEM15_P144_S5	This amount is defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation.
97745_18_ITEM15_P144_S6	The company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains/losses and prior service costs/credits that arise but were not previously required to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_18_ITEM15_P144_S7	Other comprehensive income is adjusted as these amounts are later recognized in income as components of net periodic benefit cost.
97745_18_ITEM15_P145_S0	When a company with a pension plan is acquired, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as an asset.
97745_18_ITEM15_P145_S1	The recognition of a new liability or a new asset results in the elimination of (a) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss and (b) unrecognized prior service cost or credits.
97745_18_ITEM15_P146_S0	The company funds annually, at a minimum, the statutorily required minimum amount as actuarially determined.

97745_18_ITEM15_P151_S0	The discount rate reflects the rate the company would have to pay to purchase high-quality investments that would provide cash sufficient to settle its current pension obligations.
97745_18_ITEM15_P151_S1	The discount rate is determined based on a range of factors, including the rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income corporate bonds and the related expected duration of the obligations or, in certain instances, the company has used a hypothetical portfolio of high quality instruments with maturities that mirror the benefit obligation in order to accurately estimate the discount rate relevant to a particular plan.
97745_18_ITEM15_P151_S2	The company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot-rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM15_P152_S0	The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations.
97745_18_ITEM15_P152_S1	In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the company considers the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance.
97745_18_ITEM15_P152_S2	In addition, the company may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return benchmarks.
97745_18_ITEM15_P153_S0	Asset management objectives include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to reduce interest rate and market risk and providing adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements.
97745_18_ITEM15_P154_S0	The expected rate of compensation increase reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases and is based on historic salary increase experience and management s expectations of future salary increases.
97745_18_ITEM15_P155_S0	The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in 2018 are not material.
97745_18_ITEM15_P156_S0	The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company s qualified and non-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P157_S0	The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P158_S0	The measurement date used to determine benefit information is December 31 for all plan assets and benefit obligations.
97745_18_ITEM15_P159_S0	The net periodic pension benefit cost (income) includes the following components:
97745_18_ITEM15_P160_S0	The net periodic postretirement benefit cost was not material in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P160_S1	Expected benefit payments are estimated using the same assumptions used in determining the company s benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P160_S2	Benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels, average years employed and average life spans, among other factors, and changes in any of these factors could significantly affect these estimated future benefit payments.
97745_18_ITEM15_P160_S3	Estimated future benefit payments during the next five years and in the aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter, are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P161_S0	A change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point effective January 2017 would not have caused a material change in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 and the 2017 aggregate of service and interest costs.
97745_18_ITEM15_P162_S0	The company s overall objective is to manage the assets in a liability framework where investments are selected that are expected to have similar changes in fair value as the related liabilities will have upon changes in interest rates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P162_S1	The company invests in a portfolio of both return-seeking and liability-hedging assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve long-term growth and to insulate the funded position from interest rate volatility.
97745_18_ITEM15_P162_S2	The strategic asset allocation uses a combination of risk controlled and index strategies in fixed income and global equities.
97745_18_ITEM15_P162_S3	The company also has a small portfolio (comprising less than 1% of invested assets) of private equity investments.
97745_18_ITEM15_P162_S4	The target allocations for the remaining investments are approximately 10% to funds investing in U.S. equities, approximately 10% to funds investing in international equities and approximately 80% to funds investing in fixed income securities.
97745_18_ITEM15_P162_S5	The portfolio maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_18_ITEM15_P163_S0	The company maintains specific plan assets for many of the individual pension plans outside the U.S.
97745_18_ITEM15_P163_S1	The investment strategy of each plan has been uniquely established based on the country specific standards and characteristics of the plans.
97745_18_ITEM15_P163_S2	Several of the plans have contracts with insurance companies whereby the market risks of the benefit obligations are borne by the insurance companies.
97745_18_ITEM15_P164_S0	When assets are held directly in investments, generally the objective is to invest in a portfolio of diversified assets with a variety of fund managers.
97745_18_ITEM15_P164_S1	The investments may include hedge funds, multi-asset funds, alternative investments and derivative funds with the target asset allocations ranging from approximately 0% - 25% for equities, 0% - 100% for fixed income, 0% - 20% for hedge funds, 0% - 45% for multi-asset funds, 0% to 15% for alternative investments and 0% - 22% for funds holding derivatives.
97745_18_ITEM15_P164_S2	The derivatives held by the funds are primarily interest rate swaps intended to match the movements in the plan liabilities as well as equity futures in a synthetic equity fund which provide targeted exposure to equity markets without the fund holding individual equity positions.
97745_18_ITEM15_P164_S3	Each plan maintains enough liquidity at all times to meet the near-term benefit payments.
97745_18_ITEM15_P164_S4	The fair values of the company s plan assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , by asset category are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P165_S0	The tables above present the fair value of the company s plan assets in accordance with the fair value hierarchy (Note 12 ).
97745_18_ITEM15_P165_S1	Certain pension plan assets are measured at net asset value per share and are reported as a level 2 investment above due to the company s ability to redeem its investment either at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_18_ITEM15_P165_S2	Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
97745_18_ITEM15_P165_S3	The fair value amounts of these investments presented in the above tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension plan assets.
97745_18_ITEM15_P165_S4	These investments were also redeemable at the balance sheet date or within limited time restrictions.
97745_18_ITEM15_P166_S0	The components of income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P167_S0	The components of the provision for income taxes of continuing operations are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P168_S0	The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise.
97745_18_ITEM15_P168_S1	Prior to 2017, the amount of the tax deduction in excess of compensation cost recognized was allocated to capital in excess of par value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P168_S2	Beginning in 2017, these excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision as described in Note 1 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P168_S3	In 2017 , the company's tax provision was reduced by $65 million of such benefits.
97745_18_ITEM15_P168_S4	In 2016 and 2015 , $53 million and $63 million , respectively, of such benefits were allocated to capital in excess of par value.
97745_18_ITEM15_P169_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted.
97745_18_ITEM15_P169_S1	The Tax Act includes significant changes to existing U.S. tax laws that affect the company, including a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and creation of a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (transition tax).
97745_18_ITEM15_P169_S2	The company recognized a net charge for certain aspects of the Tax Act in its 2017 financial statements for which the accounting is provisional, but reasonable estimates could be determined.
97745_18_ITEM15_P169_S3	The company recognized a $1.25 billion income tax charge for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the transition tax.
97745_18_ITEM15_P169_S4	The company also remeasured its net U.S. deferred tax balances affected by the Tax Act s reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, which resulted in a $1.06 billion income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017.
97745_18_ITEM15_P169_S5	Although the net $204 million charge represents what the company believes is a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, the components of the net charge are provisional and may change.
97745_18_ITEM15_P169_S6	For example, these estimates may be impacted by the need for further analysis and future clarification and guidance regarding available tax accounting methods and elections, earnings and profits computations and state tax conformity to federal tax changes.
97745_18_ITEM15_P170_S0	The provision for income taxes in the accompanying statement of income differs from the provision calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes due to the following:
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S0	The company has operations and a taxable presence in approximately 50 countries outside the U.S.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S1	The company's effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate each year due to certain operations that are subject to tax incentives, state and local taxes, and foreign taxes that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S2	The foreign tax credits discussed below are the result of foreign earnings and profits remitted or deemed remitted to the U.S. during the reporting year and the U.S. treatment of taxes paid in the foreign jurisdictions in the years those profits were originally earned.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S3	In 2017, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S4	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S5	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $86 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $53 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2017).
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S6	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $20 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S7	In 2016, the company continued to implement tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S8	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S9	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $91 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $37 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign rate differential in 2016).
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S10	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $100 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S11	In 2015, the company implemented tax planning initiatives related to non-U.S. subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S12	These non-U.S. subsidiaries incurred foreign tax obligations, and made cash and deemed distributions to the company s U.S. operations which resulted in no net tax cost.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S13	As a result of these distributions, the company benefitted from U.S. foreign tax credits of $111 million , offset in part by additional U.S. income taxes of $46 million on the related foreign income (which reduced the benefit from the foreign tax rate differential in 2015).
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S14	The company also implemented foreign tax credit planning in Sweden which resulted in $80 million of foreign tax credits, with no related incremental U.S. income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S15	Also in 2015, the company recorded benefits totaling $54 million related to additional prior year foreign tax and other credits as well as restructuring and other costs associated with the 2014 acquisition of Life Technologies.
97745_18_ITEM15_P171_S16	In 2017 the company refinanced certain long term inter-company debt which resulted in an income tax benefit of $237 million related to a foreign exchange loss recognized for income tax purposes.
97745_18_ITEM15_P172_S0	The company has significant activities in Singapore and has received considerable tax incentives.
97745_18_ITEM15_P173_S0	activities that have the effect of promoting economic or technological development in Singapore.
97745_18_ITEM15_P173_S1	This incentive equates to a tax exemption on earnings associated with most of the company s manufacturing activities in Singapore and continues through December 31, 2026 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P173_S2	In 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , the impact of this tax holiday decreased the annual effective tax rates by 1.0 percentage points, 1.1 percentage points and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 , $0.06 and $0.05 , respectively.
97745_18_ITEM15_P173_S3	In connection with the March 2017 extension of this agreement until 2026, the company recorded a benefit in Q1 2017 of approximately $65 million ( $0.16 per diluted share) for the effect on deferred tax balances of the extended tax holiday.
97745_18_ITEM15_P174_S0	Net deferred tax asset (liability) in the accompanying balance sheet consists of the following:
97745_18_ITEM15_P175_S0	The company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized.
97745_18_ITEM15_P175_S1	At December 31, 2017 , all of the company s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM15_P175_S2	The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P176_S0	At December 31, 2017 , the company had federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $195 million , $1.86 billion and $4.09 billion , respectively.
97745_18_ITEM15_P177_S0	Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries.
97745_18_ITEM15_P177_S1	The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2037 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P177_S2	Of the non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $1.43 billion expire in the years 2018 through 2037 , and the remainder do not expire.
97745_18_ITEM15_P178_S0	The company operates in various jurisdictions around the world.
97745_18_ITEM15_P179_S0	A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes on $13.21 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that could be subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S. because such amounts are intended to be reinvested outside the United States indefinitely.
97745_18_ITEM15_P179_S1	It is not practicable to estimate the unrecognized tax liability due to i) the extent of uncertainty as to which remittance structure would be used (among several possibilities) should a decision be made to repatriate; and ii) the implications of indirect taxes, including withholding taxes that could potentially be required depending on the repatriation structure.
97745_18_ITEM15_P180_S0	Unrecognized Tax Benefits As of December 31, 2017 , the company had $1.41 billion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
97745_18_ITEM15_P180_S1	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
97745_18_ITEM15_P181_S0	During 2017, the company s unrecognized tax benefits provisionally increased $511 million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to the scope of the Tax Act s one-time transition tax, $54 million relating to foreign tax positions, $43 million as a result of a foreign exchange loss recognized on the refinancing of certain long term inter-company debt and $31 million due to an acquisition.
97745_18_ITEM15_P181_S1	All of the total $1.41 billion liability is classified as a long-term liability.
97745_18_ITEM15_P181_S2	The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.
97745_18_ITEM15_P181_S3	During 2016, the company s unrecognized tax benefits increased $342 million due to the uncertainty around the deductibility of a foreign exchange loss on intercompany investments, $54 million due to acquisitions, $43 million due to tax planning related to prior years that resulted in amended tax filings, $35 million relating to foreign tax positions and $14 million due to the utilization of deferred tax assets.
97745_18_ITEM15_P181_S4	In 2016, the company also settled the Life Technologies tax audit for the 2012 to 2014 tax years which reduced the reserve on unrecognized tax benefits by $10 million .
97745_18_ITEM15_P181_S5	During 2015, the company s unrecognized tax benefits increased $70 million due to the utilization of deferred tax assets and $28 million relating to foreign net operating losses on which the company has a deferred tax asset established.
97745_18_ITEM15_P181_S6	This increase was offset in part by a reduction of $10 million from a resolution of an IRS audit of Life Technologies for which a reserve had previously been established.
97745_18_ITEM15_P182_S0	The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
97745_18_ITEM15_P182_S1	The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $31 million and $24 million , respectively.
97745_18_ITEM15_P183_S0	The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.

97745_18_ITEM15_P183_S2	With few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S., income tax examinations for years before 2011.
97745_18_ITEM15_P184_S0	The effective interest rates for the fixed-rate debt include the stated interest on the notes, the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium, the amortization of any debt issuance costs and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging.
97745_18_ITEM15_P184_S1	See Note 12 for fair value information pertaining to the company s long-term obligations.

97745_18_ITEM15_P186_S3	These unused lines of credit generally provide for short-term unsecured borrowings at various interest rates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P186_S4	The company has a revolving credit facility with a bank group that provides for up to $2.50 billion of unsecured multi-currency revolving credit.
97745_18_ITEM15_P186_S5	The facility expires in July 2021 .
97745_18_ITEM15_P187_S0	The agreement calls for interest at either a LIBOR-based rate, a EURIBOR-based rate (for funds drawn in Euro) or a rate based on the prime lending rate of the agent bank, at the company s option.
97745_18_ITEM15_P187_S1	The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default customary for financings of this type.
97745_18_ITEM15_P188_S0	The covenants in our revolving credit facility (the Facility) include a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (total debt-to-Consolidated EBITDA) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage ratio (Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense), as such terms are defined in the Facility.
97745_18_ITEM15_P188_S1	Specifically, the company has agreed that, so long as any lender has any commitment under the Facility, any letter of credit is outstanding under the Facility, or any loan or other obligation is outstanding under the Facility, it will maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.0 :1.0 for the first and second quarters of 2018 and then stepping down to 3.5 :1.0 for the third quarter of 2018 and thereafter.

97745_18_ITEM15_P188_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , no borrowings were outstanding under the Facility, although available capacity was reduced by approximately $77 million as a result of outstanding letters of credit.
97745_18_ITEM15_P189_S0	The company has commercial paper programs pursuant to which it may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes (CP Notes).
97745_18_ITEM15_P189_S1	Under the U.S. program, a) maturities may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue and b) the CP Notes are issued on a private placement basis under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are not redeemable prior to maturity nor subject to voluntary prepayment.

97745_18_ITEM15_P201_S0	In connection with the sale of businesses of the company, the buyers have assumed certain contractual obligations of such businesses and have agreed to indemnify the company with respect to those assumed liabilities.
97745_18_ITEM15_P201_S1	In the event a third-party to a transferred contract does not recognize the transfer of obligations or a buyer defaults on its obligations under the transferred contract, the company could be liable to the third-party for such obligations.
97745_18_ITEM15_P201_S2	However, in such event, the company would be entitled to seek indemnification from the buyer.

97745_18_ITEM15_P202_S1	The scope and duration of such indemnity obligations vary from transaction to transaction.
97745_18_ITEM15_P202_S2	Where appropriate, an obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability.
97745_18_ITEM15_P203_S0	Generally, a maximum obligation cannot be reasonably estimated.
97745_18_ITEM15_P203_S1	Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of divestiture, historically the company has not made significant payments for these indemnifications.
97745_18_ITEM15_P203_S2	In connection with the company s efforts to reduce the number of facilities that it occupies, the company has vacated some of its leased facilities or sublet them to third parties.
97745_18_ITEM15_P203_S3	When the company sublets a facility to a third-party, it remains the primary obligor under the master lease agreement with the owner of the facility.
97745_18_ITEM15_P203_S4	As a result, if a third-party vacates the sublet facility, the company would be obligated to make lease or other payments under the master lease agreement.
97745_18_ITEM15_P204_S0	The company believes that the financial risk of default by sublessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the company s financial position or results of operations.

97745_18_ITEM15_P206_S1	The company cannot predict all potential costs related to environmental remediation matters and the possible impact on future operations given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the complexity and interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods and the extent of the company s responsibility.
97745_18_ITEM15_P206_S2	Expenses for environmental remediation matters related to the costs of installing, operating and maintaining groundwater-treatment systems and other remedial activities related to historical environmental contamination at the company s domestic and international facilities were not material in any period presented.
97745_18_ITEM15_P207_S0	liabilities, based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated.
97745_18_ITEM15_P207_S1	The company calculates estimates based upon several factors, including reports prepared by environmental specialists and management s knowledge of and experience with these environmental matters.
97745_18_ITEM15_P207_S2	The company includes in these estimates potential costs for investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance of cleanup sites.
97745_18_ITEM15_P207_S3	At December 31, 2017 , the company s total environmental liability was approximately $52 million .
97745_18_ITEM15_P207_S4	While management believes the accruals for environmental remediation are adequate based on current estimates of remediation costs, the company may be subject to additional remedial or compliance costs due to future events such as changes in existing laws and regulations, changes in agency direction or enforcement policies, developments in remediation technologies or changes in the conduct of the company s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM15_P208_S0	Litigation and Related Contingencies There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the company including matters involving product liability, intellectual property, employment and commercial issues.
97745_18_ITEM15_P208_S1	The company determines the probability and range of possible loss based on the current status of each of these matters.
97745_18_ITEM15_P208_S2	A liability is recorded in the financial statements if it is believed to be probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
97745_18_ITEM15_P209_S0	The company establishes a liability that is an estimate of amounts expected to be paid in the future for events that have already occurred.
97745_18_ITEM15_P209_S1	The company accrues the most likely amount or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss when a range of probable loss can be estimated.
97745_18_ITEM15_P209_S2	The accrued liabilities are based on management s judgment as to the probability of losses for asserted and unasserted claims and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P209_S3	Accrual estimates are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made.
97745_18_ITEM15_P209_S4	The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P210_S0	Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with pending litigation or claims, the company cannot predict the outcome, nor, with respect to certain pending litigation or claims where no liability has been accrued, make a meaningful estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.
97745_18_ITEM15_P210_S1	The company has no material accruals for pending litigation or claims for which accrual amounts are not disclosed below , nor are material losses deemed probable for such matters.
97745_18_ITEM15_P210_S2	It is reasonably possible, however, that an unfavorable outcome that exceeds the company s current accrual estimate, if any, for one or more of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
97745_18_ITEM15_P210_S3	The range of probable loss for product liability, workers compensation and other personal injury matters of the company s continuing operations at December 31, 2017 , was approximately $237 million to $388 million on an undiscounted basis.

97745_18_ITEM15_P211_S0	The assets and liabilities assumed at the Fisher merger date were ascribed a fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows, using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of interest for monetary assets with comparable maturities (weighted average discount rate of 4.67% ).
97745_18_ITEM15_P211_S1	The discount on the liabilities of approximately $22 million and the discount on the assets of approximately $14 million (net discount $8 million ) are being accreted to interest expense over the expected settlement period.
97745_18_ITEM15_P212_S0	Although the company believes that the amounts accrued and estimated recoveries are probable and appropriate based on available information, including actuarial studies of loss estimates, the process of estimating losses and insurance recoveries involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and the ultimate amounts could vary materially.
97745_18_ITEM15_P213_S0	Insurance contracts do not relieve the company of its primary obligation with respect to any losses incurred.
97745_18_ITEM15_P213_S1	The collectability of amounts due from its insurers is subject to the solvency and willingness of the insurer to pay, as well as the legal sufficiency of the insurance claims.
97745_18_ITEM15_P213_S2	Management monitors the payment history as well as the financial condition and ratings of its insurers on an ongoing basis.

97745_18_ITEM15_P227_S1	The fair value of derivative contracts is the estimated amount that the company would receive/pay upon liquidation of the contracts, taking into account the change in interest rates and currency exchange rates.
97745_18_ITEM15_P227_S2	The company determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with such future payments.

97745_18_ITEM15_P231_S8	The hedge was terminated in advance of completing a debt offering in April 2016 (Note 9 ).
97745_18_ITEM15_P231_S9	The fair value of the hedge at that time, $46 million , net of tax, was classified as a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive items and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt.
