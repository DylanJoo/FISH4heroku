1474464_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation intending to elect and qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year that ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	To maintain REIT status, we will be required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	On September 2, 2010, we commenced our initial public offering ("IPO") on a best efforts basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock (exclusive of 25.0 million shares available pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the DRIP )) at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-11(File No. 333-163069) (the Registration Statement ) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
1474464_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We sold 20,000 shares to New York Recovery Special Limited Partnership, LLC, an entity wholly owned by American Realty Capital III, LLC (the Sponsor ) on October 16, 2009, at $10.00 per share.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had 327,499 common shares outstanding with an aggregate value of approximately $3.2 million based on a per share value of $10.00.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	In addition, we sold approximately 2.0 million shares of convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares ) for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act (the Preferred Offering ).
1474464_11_ITEM1_P1_S4	We are dependent upon the net proceeds from these offerings to conduct our operations.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	We were formed to acquire high quality, income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by the Company alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P2_S3	We purchased our first property, the Interior Design Building (the Design Center ), and commenced our real estate operations in June 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P2_S4	On December 1, 2010, we purchased a portfolio of five retail condominiums on Bleecker Street ( Bleecker Street ).
1474464_11_ITEM1_P2_S5	As of December 31, 2010, the Company owned six properties comprising approximately 91,000 square feet of commercial space with an aggregate purchase price of $66.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P2_S6	As of December 31, 2010, these properties were 100% occupied.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the OP ), a Delaware limited partnership.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	We are the sole general partner and holder of 99.9% of the units of the OP.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P3_S2	Our Advisor made a capital contribution to the OP in the amount of $2,000 in exchange for 200 OP units, which may be exchanged for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at our option, a corresponding number of shares of common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P3_S3	The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are managed by our Advisor and New York Recovery Properties, LLC, an entity wholly owned by the Sponsor, which serves as our property manager (the Property Manager ) unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our Dealer Manager, an affiliate of the Sponsor, serves as the dealer manager of our IPO.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	These related parties receive compensation and fees for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Real estate-related investments are higher-yield and higher-risk investments that our Advisor will actively manage, if we elect to acquire such investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	The real estate-related investments in which we may invest include: (i) mortgage loans; (ii) equity securities such as common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible preferred securities of real estate companies; (iii) debt securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgages, mortgage loan participations and debt securities issued by other real estate companies; and (iv) certain types of illiquid securities, such as mezzanine loans and bridge loans.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	Since our inception, we have not acquired any real estate-related investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	We are focused on helping our stockholders take advantage of a unique window of opportunity to participate in the expected recovery of the New York City real estate market.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our investment goals are as follows:
1474464_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Maximize Total Returns Maximize total returns to our stockholders through a combination of realized appreciation and current income.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	We intend to primarily focus our investment activities on acquiring quality income producing commercial real estate located in the New York MSA and, in particular, properties located in New York City.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition, we may elect to originate or acquire real estate debt backed by quality income producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	The real estate debt we originate or acquire is expected to be primarily first mortgage debt but also may include bridge loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	We expect to invest in commercial real estate including various property types such as office, retail, multi-family residential, industrial and hotel properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	We may invest in commercial real estate located anywhere in the continental United States, but plan to focus on commercial real estate located in New York City.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our policies require that a minimum of 70% of our assets be located in the New York MSA.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P9_S3	When evaluating prospective investments in real property, our management and our Advisor will consider relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P9_S4	In this regard, our Advisor will have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject to board approval.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	The following table lists the tenants whose annualized rental revenue represented greater than 10% of consolidated revenues:
1474464_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of one of the above tenants would have a material adverse effect on the revenues of the Company.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	No other tenant represents more than 10% of the rental revenue for the periods presented.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	In March 2011, the Company re-negotiated the lease terms with Rosselli 61 st Street LLC.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	The new terms, effective April 2011, include a reduction in monthly rent and an increase in annual rent escalations.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	We may originate or acquire real estate loans.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Although we do not have a formal policy, our criteria for investing in loans will be substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	We may originate or invest in real estate loans (including, but not limited to, investments in first, second and third mortgage loans, wraparound mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans on real property, and loans on leasehold interest mortgages).
1474464_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	We also may invest in participations in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	Further, we may invest in unsecured loans; however , we will not make unsecured loans or loans not secured by mortgages unless such loans are approved by a majority of our independent directors.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P12_S5	We currently do not intend to invest in or originate real estate loans (excluding publicly traded real estate debt) in excess of 20% of the aggregate value of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P12_S6	To the extent that we invest in collateralized mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), we intend to invest in CMBS guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, such as the Government National Mortgage Association, or U.S. government sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, to reduce the credit and interest rate risk.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	We will not make or invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans outstanding on the property, including our borrowings, would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of the property, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors unless substantial justification exists, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our board of directors may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans in cases in which we believe there is a high probability of our foreclosure upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and, in respect of transactions with our affiliates, in which the cost of the mortgage loan investment does not exceed the appraised value of the underlying property.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	Our board of directors may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans that are in default where we intend to foreclose upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and, in respect of transactions with our affiliates, where the cost of the mortgage loan investment does not exceed the appraised value of the underlying property.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our Advisor will evaluate all potential loan investments to determine if the term of the loan, the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meets our investment criteria and objectives.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	An officer, director, agent or employee of our Advisor will inspect the property securing the loan, if any, during the loan approval process.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	We do not expect to make or invest in mortgage or mezzanine loans with a maturity of more than ten years from the date of our investment, and anticipate that most loans will have a term of five years.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	We do not expect to make or invest in bridge loans with a maturity of more than one year (with the right to extend the term for an additional one year) from the date of our investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	Most loans which we will consider for investment would provide for monthly payments of interest and some also may provide for principal amortization, although many loans of the nature which we will consider provide for payments of interest only and a payment of principal in full at the end of the loan term.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P15_S3	We will not originate loans with negative amortization provisions.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our charter does not limit the amount of gross offering proceeds that we may apply to loan originations or investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our charter also does not place any limit or restriction on:
1474464_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	the types of properties subject to the mortgages or other loans in which we invest.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	We may invest in securities of non-majority owned publicly traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	We may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or options to acquire such securities.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	It is our intention that we be limited to investing no more than 20% of the aggregate value of our assets as of the close of our initial ongoing offering period and thereafter in publicly traded real estate equity or debt securities, including, but not limited to, CMBS.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	However, any investment in equity securities (including any preferred equity securities) that are not traded on a national securities exchange or included for quotation on an inter-dealer quotation system must be approved by a majority of directors, including a majority of independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair, competitive and commercially reasonable.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	We anticipate acquiring fee interests in properties (a fee interest is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although other methods of acquiring a property, including acquiring leasehold interests (a leasehold interest a right to enjoy the exclusive possession and use of an asset or property for a stated definite period as created by a written lease), may be utilized if we deem it to be advantageous.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	For example, we may acquire properties through a joint venture or the acquisition of substantially all of the interests of an entity which in turn owns the real property.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	We also may make preferred equity investments in an entity that owns real property.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our focus will be on acquiring office and retail properties but we also may acquire multifamily, industrial, hotel and other types of real property.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at a later time.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Under our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness shall not exceed 300% of our total net assets (as defined by the North American Securities Administrators Association ("NASAA") REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	In addition, it is currently our intention to limit our aggregate borrowings to 40% to 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets (calculated after the close of our initial ongoing offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of this offering), unless borrowing a greater amount is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for borrowing such a greater amount.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	We will not borrow from our Advisor or its affiliates unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Except with respect to the borrowing limits contained in our charter, we may reevaluate and change our financing policies without a stockholder vote.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include: then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, our expected investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our annual taxable income (which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1474464_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our board of directors may authorize distributions in excess of those required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	We calculate our monthly distributions based upon daily record and distribution declaration dates so investors may be entitled to distributions immediately upon purchasing our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors declared a distribution rate equal to a 6.05% annualized rate based on the common share price of $10.00, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	The distributions will be payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	The dividend will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	On January 5, 2011, we paid approximately $10,000 in distributions to common stockholders of record on December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We, our board of directors and Advisor share a similar philosophy with respect to paying our distribution.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	The distribution should principally be derived from cash flows generated from real estate operations.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	In order to improve our operating cash flows and our ability to pay dividends from operating cash flows, our affiliated Advisor agreed to waive certain fees including asset management and property management fees.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	The Company pays the Advisor an annualized asset management fee of up to 0.75% based on the aggregate contract purchase price of all real estate investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	The Advisor has elected to waive its asset management fees of approximately $0.2 million related to the year ended December 31, 2010, and will determine if a portion or all of such fees will be waived in subsequent periods on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S5	The fees that were waived relating to the year ended December 31, 2010 are not deferrals and accordingly, will not be paid by the Company.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S6	Because the Advisor waived certain fees that we owed, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor was available to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S7	In certain instances, to improve our working capital, the Advisor may elect to absorb a portion of our general and administrative costs that would otherwise have been paid by us.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S8	Additionally, the Advisor at its election may contribute capital to enhance our cash position for distribution purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S9	Any contributed capital amounts are not reimbursable to our Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S10	Further, any capital contributions are made without any corresponding issuance of common or preferred shares of beneficial interest.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P29_S11	The Advisor contributed approximately $0.1 million to us during the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our Preferred Shares pay cumulative dividends monthly in arrears at the annualized rate of 8.0% on the liquidation preference of $9.00 per share, resulting in a dividend rate of 8.23%.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid approximately $0.7 million of dividends to preferred stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	On January 15, 2011, we paid approximately $0.1 million of dividends to preferred stockholders of record on December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, and so long as we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	The retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential real estate markets are highly competitive.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	We compete with other owners and operators of retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	The continued development of new retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we operate.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others may be organized in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P34_S5	Therefore, we compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase.
1474464_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The employees of the Advisor and other affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, wholesale brokerage and investor relations services.

1474464_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to an Investment in American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We have a very limited operating history and have no established financing sources, and the prior performance of other real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor may not be an indication of our future results.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We have a very limited operating history and you should not rely upon the past performance of other real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor to predict our future results.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We were incorporated on October 6, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we have acquired only six properties and do not otherwise have any operations or independent financing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The recent real estate experience of Messrs. Schorsch, Kahane and Happel principally has focused on triple-net leasing rather than the ownership and operation of real estate properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Accordingly, the prior performance of real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane and our Advisor may not be indicative of our future results.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Moreover, neither our Advisor nor we have any established financing sources.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Presently, both we and our Advisor have been funded by capital contributions or advances from American Realty Capital III, LLC, a company which is directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. Schorsch and Mr. Kahane, and by loans from unaffiliated entities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If our capital resources, or those of our Advisor, are insufficient to support our operations, we will not be successful.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	You should consider our prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are, like us, in their early stage of development.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	To be successful in this market, we must, among other things:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	continue to build and expand our operations structure to support our business.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We cannot guarantee that we will succeed in achieving these goals, and our failure to do so could cause you to lose all or a portion of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Because our initial ongoing offering is a blind pool offering, you will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them, which makes an investment in us more speculative.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have acquired six properties and have not identified any other properties to acquire.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Additionally, we will not provide you with information to evaluate our investments prior to our acquisition of properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	We will seek to invest substantially all the offering proceeds available for investment, after the payment of fees and expenses, in the acquisition of properties located in the New York MSA, and, in particular, New York City, or otherwise only in the United States.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We also may, in the discretion of our Advisor, invest in other types of real estate or in entities that invest in real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, our Advisor may make or invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or participations therein on our behalf if our board of directors determines, due to the state of the real estate market or in order to diversify our investment portfolio or otherwise, that such investments are advantageous to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	You may be more likely to sustain a loss on your investment because our Sponsor does not have as strong an economic incentive to avoid losses as does a sponsor who has made significant equity investments in its company.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our Sponsor has only invested $200,000 in us through the purchase of 20,000 shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Therefore, if we are successful in raising enough proceeds to be able to reimburse our Sponsor for our significant organization and offering expenses, our Sponsor will have little exposure to loss in the value of our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Without this exposure, our investors may be at a greater risk of loss because our Sponsor may have less to lose from a decrease in the value of our shares as does a sponsor that makes more significant equity investments in its company.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	There is no public trading market for our shares and there may never be one; therefore, it will be difficult for you to sell your shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	There currently is no public market for our shares and there may never be one.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If you are able to find a buyer for your shares, you may not sell your shares unless the buyer meets applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards and the sale does not violate state securities laws.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our charter also prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock by a single investor, unless exempted by our board of directors, which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase your shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Moreover, our share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that would limit your ability to sell your shares to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Our board of directors may reject any request for redemption of shares, or amend, suspend or terminate our share repurchase program upon 30 days notice.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Therefore, it will be difficult for you to sell your shares promptly or at all.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	If you are able to sell your shares, you likely will have to sell them at a substantial discount to the price you paid for the shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S7	It also is likely that your shares would not be accepted as the primary collateral for a loan.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P13_S8	You should purchase the shares only as a long-term investment because of the illiquid nature of the shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If we, through New York Recovery Advisors, LLC, are unable to find suitable investments, then we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions is dependent upon the performance of New York Recovery Advisors, LLC, our Advisor, in acquiring our investments, selecting tenants for our properties and securing independent financing arrangements.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We cannot be sure that our Advisor will be successful in obtaining suitable investments on financially attractive terms or that, if it makes investments on our behalf, our objectives will be achieved.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we, through our Advisor, are unable to find suitable investments, we will hold the proceeds from our offering in an interest-bearing account, invest the proceeds in short-term, investment-grade investments or, if we cannot find at least one suitable investment within one year after we reach our minimum offering, or if our board of directors determines it is in the best interests of our stockholders, liquidate.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	In such an event, our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders would be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We could suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, particularly as a result of our reliance on our Advisor at times when management of our Advisor is simultaneously seeking to locate suitable investments for other affiliated programs including American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., or ARCT, Phillips Edison ARC Shopping Center REIT, Inc., or PEARC, American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust, Inc., or ARC HT, American Realty Capital Retail Centers of America, Inc., or ARC RCA, and Business Development Corporation of America, Inc., or BDCA, each of which are American Realty Capital sponsored programs that have been declared effective by the SEC, in addition to American Realty Capital Trust II, Inc, or ARCT II, American Realty Capital Trust III, or ARCT III, ARC Northcliffe Income Properties, Inc., or ARC-Northcliffe and American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., or ARCP, each of which are American Realty Capital sponsored programs that are currently in registration with the SEC.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Delays we encounter in the selection, acquisition and, if we develop properties, development of income-producing properties, likely would adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your overall returns.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In such event, we may pay all or a substantial portion of our distributions from the proceeds of our offering or from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow, which may constitute a return of your capital.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from our offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would; (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Distributions from the proceeds of our offering or from borrowings also could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	This, in turn, would reduce the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S6	In particular, where we acquire properties prior to the start of construction or during the early stages of construction, it typically will take several months to complete construction and rent available space.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Therefore, you could suffer delays in the receipt of cash distributions attributable to those particular properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If New York Recovery Advisors, LLC is unable to obtain suitable investments, we will hold the proceeds of our offering in an interest-bearing account or invest the proceeds in short-term, investment-grade investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we cannot invest proceeds from our offering within a reasonable amount of time, or if our board of directors determines it is in the best interests of our stockholders, we will return the uninvested proceeds to investors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our properties may be adversely affected by the current economic downturn, as well as economic cycles and risks inherent to the New York MSA, especially New York City.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We expect to use substantially all the net proceeds of our offering to acquire quality income-producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City and elsewhere in the New York MSA.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the New York MSA, including a continuation or worsening of the current economic downturn, would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this markets in both the short and long term.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in the New York MSA could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The factors affecting economic conditions in the New York MSA include:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In addition, since rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions, our office properties located in the New York MSA may be adversely affected during periods of diminished economic growth and a decline in white-collar employment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for over two years.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A protracted economic downturn could have a negative impact on our portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If real property or other real estate related asset values continue to decline after we acquire them, we may have a difficult time making new acquisitions or generating returns on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If the current debt market environment persists, we may modify our investment strategy in order to optimize our portfolio performance.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Our options would include limiting or eliminating the use of debt and focusing on those investments that do not require the use of leverage to meet our portfolio goals.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	It is impossible for us to assess with certainty the future effects of the current adverse trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic area in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in this area.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If the current economic downturn persists or if there is any further local, national or global worsening of the current economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability will be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Because our properties will be located primarily in New York City, our portfolio may be concentrated in properties of substantial size.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We anticipate having significant investments in the New York MSA, primarily in New York City, where individual property values may be substantially higher than in other geographic areas in the United States or abroad.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may acquire one or more individual properties with high acquisition costs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	As a result, our portfolio may be concentrated in few properties of substantial size.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the New York MSA would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We anticipate having significant investments in the New York MSA, primarily in New York City.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	This in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number and type of investments we may make and the value of your investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific properties we acquire.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our offering is being made on a best efforts basis, whereby the Dealer Manager is only required to use its best efforts to sell our shares and has no firm commitment or obligation to purchase any of the shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	As a result, the amount of proceeds we raise in our offering may be substantially less than the amount we would need to achieve a broadly diversified property portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If we are unable to raise substantially more than the minimum offering amount, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the number of investments owned, the geographic regions in which our investments are located and the types of investments that we make.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	In such event, the likelihood of our profitability being affected by the performance of any one of our investments will increase.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	For example, if we are unable to sell additional shares, we may not be able to make any additional investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S5	If we are not able to make any additional investments, we would not achieve any asset diversification.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Additionally, we are not limited in the number or size of our investments or the percentage of net proceeds we may dedicate to a single investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Your investment in our shares will be subject to greater risk to the extent that we lack a diversified portfolio of investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P30_S8	In addition, our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, and our financial condition and ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain key personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain of our executive officers and other key personnel of our Advisor, including Nicholas S. Schorsch and William M. Kahane, each of whom would be difficult to replace.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our Advisor does not have an employment agreement with any of these key personnel and we cannot guarantee that all, or any particular one, will remain affiliated with us and/or our Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If any of our key personnel were to cease their affiliation with our Advisor, our operating results could suffer.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Further, we do not intend to separately maintain key person life insurance on Messrs. Schorsch or Kahane or any other person.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P32_S4	We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our Advisor s ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial, operational and marketing personnel.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that our Advisor will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P32_S6	If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain the services of key personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered, and the value of your investment may decline.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We may be unable to pay or maintain distributions from cash available from operations or increase distributions over time.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	There are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash distributions to stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	We intend to pay distributions from cash available from our operations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The amount of cash available for distributions is affected by many factors, such as our ability to buy properties as offering proceeds become available, rental income from such properties and our operating expense levels, as well as many other variables.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Actual cash available for distributions may vary substantially from estimates.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S3	With no prior operating history, we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay or maintain our current level of distributions or that distributions will increase over time.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S4	We cannot give any assurance that rents from the properties will increase, that the securities we buy will increase in value or provide constant or increased distributions over time, or that future acquisitions of real properties, mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or any investments in securities will increase our cash available for distributions to stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Our actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used by our board of directors in establishing the distribution rate to stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S6	We may not have sufficient cash from operations to make a distribution required to qualify for or maintain our REIT status.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S7	We may pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S8	For example, we may borrow money or use proceeds from our offering to make distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S9	Any such distributions will constitute a return of capital and may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties and negatively impact the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P35_S10	In addition, we may issue additional securities or sell assets to fund distribution payments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers, directors and our Advisor are limited, which could reduce your and our recovery against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In addition, subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors, officers and Advisor and our Advisor s affiliates and permits us to indemnify our employees and agents.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	However, as required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines, our charter provides that we may not indemnify a director, our Advisor or an affiliate of our Advisor for any loss or liability suffered by any of them or hold harmless such indemnitee for any loss or liability suffered by us unless; (1) the indemnitee determined, in good faith, that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in our best interests, (2) the indemnitee was acting on behalf of or performing services for us, (3) the liability or loss was not the result of (A) negligence or misconduct, in the case of a director (other than an independent director), the Advisor or an affiliate of the Advisor, or (B) gross negligence or willful misconduct, in the case of an independent director, and (4) the indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of our net assets and not from our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Although our charter does not allow us to indemnify or hold harmless an indemnitee to a greater extent than permitted under Maryland law and the NASAA REIT Guidelines, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors, officers, employees and agents, and our Advisor and its affiliates, than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce your and our recovery against them.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents or our Advisor and its affiliates in some cases which would decrease the cash otherwise available for distribution to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We will be subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationships with our Advisor and its affiliates, including the material conflicts discussed below.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC will face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase and leasing of properties, and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect our investment opportunities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Affiliates of our Advisor have sponsored other real estate investment programs, including ACRT, PEARC, ARC HT, ARC RCA, ARCT II, ARCT III, ARC-Northcliffe and ARCP.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	ARCT commenced its initial public offering of 150.0 million shares of common stock on January 25, 2008 and has acquired 259 properties, primarily comprised of freestanding, single-tenant retail and commercial properties that are net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As of December 31, 2010, ARCT had total real estate investments, at cost, of approximately $872.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	PEARC intends to invest primarily in necessity-based neighborhood and community shopping centers throughout the United States, with a focus on grocery anchored shopping centers.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	ARC HT intends to invest primarily in medical office buildings and healthcare-related facilities in the United States.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	ARC RCA intends to invest primarily in existing anchored, stabilized core retail properties, including power centers, lifestyle centers, grocery-anchored shopping centers and other need-based shopping centers located in the United States and at least 80% leased at the time of acquisition.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	ARCT II intends to invest primarily in free-standing, single-tenant bank branch, convenience store, retail, office and industrial properties that are double-net and triple-net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	ARCT III intends to invest primarily in free-standing retail properties that are double-net and triple-net leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S5	ARC-Northcliffe intends to invest primarily in tenant commercial properties and lease them back to the sellers pursuant to leases generally having terms of at least ten years in the United States and Europe.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S6	ARCP intends to invest in commercial properties with medium term net leases.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S7	Affiliates of our Advisor may sponsor additional other real estate investment programs in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S8	We may buy properties at the same time and/or in the same geographic areas as one or more of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs managed by officers and key personnel of our Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S9	There is a risk our Advisor will choose a property that provides lower returns to us than a property purchased by another American Realty Capital-sponsored program.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S10	We cannot be sure that officers and key personnel acting on behalf of our Advisor and on behalf of managers of other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs will act in our best interests when deciding whether to allocate any particular property to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S11	Also, although our board of directors adopted a policy whereby we may not acquire properties from affiliated entities, we may in the future, with the approval of our board, change our policy and acquire properties from, or sell properties to, other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs, and although we will do so consistent with our investment procedures, objectives and policies, transactions entered between us and our affiliates will not be subject to arm s-length negotiations, which could mean that the acquisitions may be on terms less favorable to us than those negotiated with unaffiliated parties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S12	However, our charter provides that the purchase price of any property acquired from an affiliate may not exceed its fair market value as determined by a qualified independent appraiser selected by our independent directors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S13	In addition, a majority of our directors, including a majority of independent directors, who have no financial interest in the transaction, must determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to us and that the transaction is at a price to us not greater than the cost to our affiliate or, if the price to us exceeds the cost paid by our affiliate, that there is substantial justification for the excess cost.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S14	Furthermore, if one of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs attracts a tenant that we are competing for, we could suffer a loss of revenue due to delays in locating another suitable tenant.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S15	You will not have the opportunity to evaluate the manner in which these conflicts of interest are resolved before or after making your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P42_S16	Similar conflicts of interest may apply if our Advisor determines to make or purchase mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or participations therein on our behalf, since other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs may be competing with us for these investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC faces conflicts of interest relating to joint ventures, which could result in a disproportionate benefit to the other venture partners at our expense.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We have entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliated entity, American Realty Capital Operating Partnership, L.P., and may enter into joint ventures with other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC may have conflicts of interest in determining which American Realty Capital-sponsored program should enter into any particular joint venture agreement.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In addition, New York Recovery Advisors, LLC may face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interest of the affiliated co-venturer and in managing the joint venture.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Since New York Recovery Advisors, LLC and its affiliates will control both the affiliated co-venturer and, to a certain extent, us, agreements and transactions between the co-venturers with respect to any such joint venture will not have the benefit of arm s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers, which may result in the co-venturer receiving benefits greater than the benefits that we receive.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, we may assume liabilities related to the joint venture that exceeds the percentage of our investment in the joint venture.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC and its officers and employees and certain of our key personnel face competing demands relating to their time, and this may cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC and its officers and employees and certain of our key personnel and their respective affiliates are key personnel, general partners and sponsors of other real estate programs having investment objectives and legal and financial obligations similar to ours and may have other business interests as well.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Because these persons have competing demands on their time and resources, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our business and these other activities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If this occurs, the returns on our investments may suffer.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Our officers and directors face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with affiliated entities, which could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to generate returns to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Certain of our executive officers, including Nicholas S. Schorsch, who also serves as the chairman of our board of directors, and William M. Kahane, our president, also are officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager, our Dealer Manager and other affiliated entities, including the advisor and property manager of other REITs sponsored by the American Realty Capital group of companies.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a result, these individuals owe fiduciary duties to these other entities and their stockholders and limited partners, which fiduciary duties may conflict with the duties that they owe to us and our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Their loyalties to these other entities could result in actions or inactions that are detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our investment and leasing opportunities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of new investments and management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) our purchase of properties from, or sale of properties, to affiliated entities, (c) the timing and terms of the investment in or sale of an asset, (d) development of our properties by affiliates, (e) investments with affiliates of our Advisor, (f) compensation to our Advisor, and (g) our relationship with our Dealer Manager and Property Manager.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P49_S4	If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, we may be unable to generate cash needed to make distributions to you and to maintain or increase the value of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P49_S5	If these individuals act or fail to act in a manner that is detrimental to our business or favor one entity over another, they may be subject to liability for breach of fiduciary duty.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC faces conflicts of interest relating to the incentive fee structure under our advisory agreement, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Under our advisory agreement, New York Recovery Advisors, LLC or its affiliates will be entitled to fees that are structured in a manner intended to provide incentives to our Advisor to perform in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	However, because our Advisor does not maintain a significant equity interest in us and is entitled to receive substantial minimum compensation regardless of performance, our Advisor s interests are not wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	In that regard, our Advisor could be motivated to recommend riskier or more speculative investments in order for us to generate the specified levels of performance or sales proceeds that would entitle our Advisor to fees.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	In addition, our Advisor s or its affiliates entitlement to fees upon the sale of our assets and to participate in sale proceeds could result in our Advisor recommending sales of our investments at the earliest possible time at which sales of investments would produce the level of return that would entitle the Advisor to compensation relating to such sales, even if continued ownership of those investments might be in our best long-term interest.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Our advisory agreement will require us to pay a performance-based termination fee to our Advisor or its affiliates if we terminate the advisory agreement prior to the listing of our shares for trading on an exchange or, absent such listing, in respect of its participation in net sales proceeds.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S5	To avoid paying this fee, our independent directors may decide against terminating the advisory agreement prior to our listing of our shares or disposition of our investments even if, but for the termination fee, termination of the advisory agreement would be in our best interest.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S6	In addition, the requirement to pay the fee to the Advisor or its affiliates at termination could cause us to make different investment or disposition decisions than we would otherwise make, in order to satisfy our obligation to pay the fee to the terminated Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Moreover, our Advisor will have the right to terminate the advisory agreement upon a change of control of our company and thereby trigger the payment of the performance fee, which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing the change of control.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	There is no separate counsel for us and our affiliates, which could result in conflicts of interest.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Proskauer Rose LLP acts as legal counsel to us and also represents our Advisor and some of its affiliates.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P53_S1	There is a possibility in the future that the interests of the various parties may become adverse and, under the Code of Professional Responsibility of the legal profession, Proskauer Rose LLP may be precluded from representing any one or all such parties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P53_S2	If any situation arises in which our interests appear to be in conflict with those of our Advisor or its affiliates, additional counsel may be retained by one or more of the parties to assure that their interests are adequately protected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Moreover, should a conflict of interest not be readily apparent, Proskauer Rose LLP may inadvertently act in derogation of the interest of the parties which could affect our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the shares of our stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P56_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Our charter permits our board of directors to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of common stockholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Our charter permits our board of directors to issue up to 250.0 million shares of stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In addition, our board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series of stock that we have authority to issue.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P58_S3	Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have a priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may limit your ability to exit the investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Under Maryland law, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P60_S1	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has exempted any business combination involving New York Recovery Advisors, LLC or any affiliate of New York Recovery Advisors, LLC.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and New York Recovery Advisors, LLC or any affiliate of New York Recovery Advisors, LLC.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P67_S3	As a result, New York Recovery Advisors, LLC and any affiliate of New York Recovery Advisors, LLC may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P67_S4	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by stockholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	A control share acquisition means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or by-laws of the corporation.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Our by-laws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P71_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The company is not registered, and does not intend to register itself or any of its subsidiaries, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P73_S1	If we become obligated to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company, the registered entity would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act imposing, among other things:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The company intends to conduct its operations, directly and through wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, so that the company and each of its subsidiaries are exempt from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Since we will be primarily engaged in the business of acquiring real estate, we believe that the company and most, if not all, of its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries will not be considered investment companies under either Section 3(a)(1)(A) or Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	If the company or any of its wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries would ever inadvertently fall within one of the definitions of investment company, we intend to rely on the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Under Section 3(c)(5)(C), the SEC staff generally requires the company to maintain at least 55% of its assets directly in qualifying assets and at least 80% of the entity s assets in qualifying assets and in a broader category of real estate related assets to qualify for this exception.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Mortgage-related securities may or may not constitute such qualifying assets, depending on the characteristics of the mortgage-related securities, including the rights that we have with respect to the underlying loans.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The company s ownership of mortgage-related securities, therefore, is limited by provisions of the Investment Company Act and SEC staff interpretations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The method we use to classify our assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act will be based in large measure upon no-action positions taken by the SEC staff in the past.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P79_S1	These no-action positions were issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and a number of these no-action positions were issued more than ten years ago.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	No assurance can be given that the SEC staff will concur with our classification of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P80_S1	In addition, the SEC staff may, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to re-classify our assets for purposes of qualifying for an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P80_S2	If we are required to re-classify our assets, we may no longer be in compliance with the exclusion from the definition of an investment company provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	A change in the value of any of our assets could cause us or one or more of our wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries to fall within the definition of investment company and negatively affect our ability to maintain our exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P81_S1	To avoid being required to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P81_S2	In addition, we may have to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or may have to forgo opportunities to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire and would be important to our investment strategy.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P82_S0	If we were required to register the company as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P83_S0	You are bound by the majority vote on matters on which you are entitled to vote, and therefore, your vote on a particular matter may be superseded by the vote of others.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P84_S0	You may vote on certain matters at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, including the election of directors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P84_S1	However, you will be bound by the majority vote on matters requiring approval of a majority of the stockholders even if you do not vote with the majority on any such matter.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P85_S0	If you do not agree with the decisions of our board of directors, you only have limited control over changes in our policies and operations and may not be able to change such policies and operations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Our board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding investments, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders except to the extent that such policies are set forth in our charter.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P86_S2	Under the Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter, our stockholders have a right to vote only on the following:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P87_S0	certain mergers, consolidations or sales or other dispositions of all or substantially all our assets, as provided in our charter.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P88_S0	All other matters are subject to the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our board of directors may change our investment policies without stockholder approval, which could alter the nature of your investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P90_S1	These policies may change over time.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P90_S2	The methods of implementing our investment policies also may vary, as new real estate development trends emerge and new investment techniques are developed.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Our investment policies, the methods for their implementation, and our other objectives, policies and procedures may be altered by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P90_S4	As a result, the nature of your investment could change without your consent.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P91_S0	We will not calculate the net asset value per share for our shares until 18 months after completion of our last offering, therefore, you will not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an ongoing basis during our offering and for a substantial period of time thereafter.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We do not intend to calculate the net asset value per share for our shares until 18 months after the completion of our last offering.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Beginning 18 months after the completion of the last offering of our shares (excluding offerings under our distribution reinvestment plan), our board of directors will determine the value of our properties and our other assets based on such information as our board determines appropriate, which may or may not include independent valuations of our properties or of our enterprise as a whole.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P93_S1	We will disclose this net asset value to stockholders in our filings with the SEC.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P93_S2	Therefore, you will not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an ongoing basis during our offering.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P94_S0	You are limited in your ability to sell your shares pursuant to our share repurchase program and may have to hold your shares for an indefinite period of time.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Our board of directors may amend the terms of our share repurchase program without stockholder approval.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Our board of directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program upon 30 days notice or to reject any request for repurchase.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S2	In addition, the share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that would limit your ability to sell your shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Generally, you must have held your shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S4	Subject to funds being available, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below until we establish an estimated value of our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S5	We do not currently anticipate obtaining appraisals for our investments (other than investments in transactions with our Sponsor, Advisor, directors or their respective affiliates) and, accordingly, the estimated value of our investments should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S6	We expect to begin establishing an estimated value of our shares based on the value of our real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of our offering.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P95_S7	We will retain persons independent of us and our Advisor to prepare the estimated value of our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Only those stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions may be able to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In other words, once our shares are transferred for value by a stockholder, the transferee and all subsequent holders of the shares are not eligible to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P97_S0	We will repurchase shares on the last business day of each quarter (and in all events on a date other than a dividend payment date).
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Prior to establishing the estimated value of our shares, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows: (a) the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least one year, (b) the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least two years, (c) the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least three years, and (d) the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least four years (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P97_S2	These limits might prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any year.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P97_S3	These restrictions severely limit your ability to sell your shares should you require liquidity, and limit your ability to recover the value you invested or the fair market value of your shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We established the offering price on an arbitrary basis; as a result, the actual value of your investment may be substantially less than what you pay.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our board of directors has arbitrarily determined the selling price of the shares, and such price bears no relationship to our book or asset values, or to any other established criteria for valuing issued or outstanding shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Because the offering price is not based upon any independent valuation, the offering price is not indicative of the proceeds that you would receive upon liquidation.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Your interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Existing stockholders and potential investors in our offering do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P101_S1	Our charter currently has authorized 250.0 million shares of stock, of which 240.0 million shares are designated as common stock and 10.0 million are designated as preferred stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Subject to any limitations set forth under Maryland law, our board of directors may increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock, increase or decrease the number of shares of any class or series of stock designated, or reclassify any unissued shares without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P101_S3	All such shares may be issued in the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P101_S4	Existing stockholders and investors purchasing shares in our offering likely will suffer dilution of their equity investment in us, if we: (a) sell shares in our offering or sell additional shares in the future, including those issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan; (b) sell securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock; (c) issue shares of our common stock in a private offering of securities to institutional investors; (d) issue restricted share awards to our directors; (e) issue shares to our Advisor or its successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation as set forth under our advisory agreement; or (f) issue shares of our common stock to sellers of properties acquired by us in connection with an exchange of limited partnership interests of New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., existing stockholders and investors purchasing shares in our offering will likely experience dilution of their equity investment in us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P101_S5	In addition, the partnership agreement for New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. contains provisions that would allow, under certain circumstances, other entities, including other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs, to merge into or cause the exchange or conversion of their interest for interests of New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. Because the limited partnership interests of New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. may, in the discretion of our board of directors, be exchanged for shares of our common stock, any merger, exchange or conversion between New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. and another entity ultimately could result in the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, thereby diluting the percentage ownership interest of other stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P101_S6	Because of these and other reasons described in this Risk Factors section, you should not expect to be able to own a significant percentage of our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Future offerings of equity securities which are senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation may adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P103_S0	In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity securities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Under our charter, we may issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock or other classes of common stock with rights that could dilute the value of your shares of common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Any issuance of preferred stock must be approved by a majority of our independent directors not otherwise interested in the transaction, who will have access, at our expense, to our legal counsel or to independent legal counsel.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Upon liquidation, holders of our shares of preferred stock having a preference as to dividend distributions or upon liquidation will be entitled to receive our available assets prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Additionally, any convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P104_S5	Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay a liquidating distribution or dividends to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share trading price of our common stock and diluting their interest in us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Your investment will be diluted upon conversion of the convertible stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P107_S0	On December 22, 2009, we commenced a private offering to accredited investors of up to $50.0 million in shares of our 8% series A convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares) subject to an option to increase the offering up to $100.0 million in shares of our preferred stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P107_S1	This private offering was terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the registration statement with respect to our common shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P107_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had received aggregate gross offering proceeds, net of certain discounts, of approximately $17.0 million from the sale of approximately 2.0 million shares in this private offering.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P107_S3	The Preferred Shares are convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock after September 2, 2011, the first anniversary of the final closing of the private offering at a conversion price of $9.00 per share (subject to discounts to a price not less than $8.50).
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P107_S4	This conversion price is at a discount from the public offering price of our common stock pursuant to our offering and will result dilution of our stockholders interest in us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Payment of fees to New York Recovery Advisors, LLC and its affiliates reduces cash available for investment and distribution.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P109_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC and its affiliates will perform services for us in connection with the offer and sale of the shares, the selection and acquisition of our investments, and the management and leasing of our properties, the servicing of our mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans, if any, and the administration of our other investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P109_S1	They are paid substantial fees for these services, which reduces the amount of cash available for investment in properties or distribution to stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Such fees and reimbursements include, but are not limited to: (i) a property management fee of 4% of gross revenues from properties managed; (ii) an asset management fee equal to 0.75% of the cost our assets (provided, however , that no fee will accrue or be payable on assets acquired using the proceeds from the private offering until we have sufficient cash flow to pay dividends on the preferred shares); (iii) reimbursement of up to 1.5% of gross offering proceeds for organization and offering expenses; (iv) acquisition fees equal to 1.0% of the contract purchase price of each property or asset that we acquire (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such property) and 1.0% of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such investment), along with reimbursement of acquisition expenses; (v) reimbursement for expenses actually incurred (including personnel costs) related to selecting, evaluating and acquiring assets on our behalf; (vi) a financing coordination fee equal to 0.75% of the amount available and/or outstanding under any debt financing that we obtain and use for the acquisition of properties and other investments or that is assumed, directly or indirectly, in connection with the acquisition of properties; (vii) a real estate commission paid on the sale of property, up to the lesser of 2% and one-half of the total brokerage commission paid if a third party broker is also involved; (viii) a subordinated participation in net sale proceeds equal to 15% of remaining Net Sale Proceeds (as defined in the advisory agreement) after return of capital contributions plus payment to investors of an annual 6% cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded return on the capital contributed by investors; (ix) a subordinated incentive listing fee equal to 15% of the amount by which the sum of our adjusted market value plus distributions exceeds the sum of the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to an annual 6% cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded return to investors; and (x) a subordinated termination fee, in each case subject to the conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Because of our holding company structure, we depend on our operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries for cash flow and we will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of such operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We are a holding company with no business operations of our own.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S1	Our only significant asset is and will be the general partnership interests of our operating partnership.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S2	We conduct, and intend to conduct, all of our business operations through our operating partnership.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S3	Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our operating partnership and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S4	We cannot assure you that our operating partnership or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to make distributions to our stockholders from cash flows from operations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S5	Each of our operating partnership s subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from such entities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S6	In addition, because we are a holding company, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P111_S7	Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy your claims as stockholders only after all of our and our operating partnerships and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Our operating results will be affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general, and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P114_S0	periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P115_S0	These and other reasons may prevent us from being profitable or from realizing growth or maintaining the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P116_S0	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant s lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Such a bankruptcy filing would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Post-bankruptcy debts would be paid currently.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P117_S3	If a lease is assumed, all pre-bankruptcy balances owing under it must be paid in full.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P117_S4	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P117_S5	If a lease is rejected, it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant because our claim is capped at the rent reserved under the lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year or 15% of the remaining term of the lease, but not greater than three years, plus rent already due but unpaid.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P117_S6	This claim could be paid only if funds were available, and then only in the same percentage as that realized on other unsecured claims.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P118_S0	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Such an event could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments that would mean a reduction in our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P119_S0	In the event of a bankruptcy, we cannot assure you that the tenant or its trustee will assume our lease.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P119_S1	If a given lease, or guaranty of a lease, is not assumed, our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to you may be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P120_S0	If a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a tenant s bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition could be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P121_S0	We may enter into sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we would purchase a property and then lease the same property back to the person from whom we purchased it.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P121_S1	In the event of the bankruptcy of a tenant, a transaction structured as a sale-leaseback may be re-characterized as either a financing or a joint venture, either of which outcomes could adversely affect our business.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P121_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a financing, we might not be considered the owner of the property, and as a result would have the status of a creditor in relation to the tenant.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P121_S3	In that event, we would no longer have the right to sell or encumber our ownership interest in the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P121_S4	Instead, we would have a claim against the tenant for the amounts owed under the lease, with the claim arguably secured by the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P122_S0	The tenant/debtor might have the ability to propose a plan restructuring the term, interest rate and amortization schedule of its outstanding balance.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P122_S1	If confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we could be bound by the new terms, and prevented from foreclosing our lien on the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P122_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a joint venture, our lessee and we could be treated as co-venturers with regard to the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P122_S3	As a result, we could be held liable, under some circumstances, for debts incurred by the lessee relating to the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P122_S4	Either of these outcomes could adversely affect our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P124_S0	If we enter into sale-leaseback transactions, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a true lease for tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P124_S1	However, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge such characterization.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P124_S2	In the event that any such sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P124_S3	If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification asset tests or income tests and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P124_S4	Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Properties that have vacancies for a significant period of time could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P126_S0	A property may incur vacancies either by the continued default of tenants under their leases or the expiration of tenant leases.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P126_S1	If vacancies continue for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues resulting in less cash to be distributed to stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P126_S2	In addition, because properties market values depend principally upon the value of the properties leases, the resale value of properties with prolonged vacancies could suffer, which could further reduce your return.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P127_S0	We may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property and would have only limited recourse if our due diligence did not identify any issues that lower the value of our property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P128_S0	The seller of a property often sells such property in its as is condition on a where is basis and with all faults, without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P128_S1	In addition, purchase agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P128_S2	The purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk that we may lose some or all our invested capital in the property as well as the loss of rental income from that property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P129_S0	We may be unable to secure funds for future tenant improvements or capital needs, which could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P130_S0	When tenants do not renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, it is usual that, in order to attract replacement tenants, we will be required to expend substantial funds for tenant improvements and tenant refurbishments to the vacated space.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P130_S1	In addition, we will likely be responsible for any major structural repairs, such as repairs to the foundation, exterior walls and rooftops, even if our leases with tenants require tenants to pay routine property maintenance costs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P130_S2	We will use substantially all of our offering s gross proceeds to buy real estate and pay various fees and expenses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P130_S3	We intend to reserve only 0.1% of the gross proceeds from our offering for future capital needs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P130_S4	Accordingly, if we need additional capital in the future to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason, we will have to obtain financing from other sources, such as cash flow from operations, borrowings, property sales or future equity offerings.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P130_S5	These sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P130_S6	If we cannot procure additional funding for capital improvements, our investments may generate lower cash flows or decline in value, or both.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Our inability to sell a property when we desire to do so could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P132_S0	The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P132_S1	We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P132_S2	We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P133_S0	We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P133_S1	We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Moreover, in acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P133_S3	These provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P134_S0	We may not be able to sell our properties at a price equal to, or greater than, the price for which we purchased such property, which may lead to a decrease in the value of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Many of our leases will not contain rental increases over time.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P135_S1	Therefore, the value of the property to a potential purchaser may not increase over time, which may restrict our ability to sell a property, or if we are able to sell such property, may lead to a sale price less than the price that we paid to purchase the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P136_S0	We may acquire or finance properties with lock-out provisions, which may prohibit us from selling a property, or may require us to maintain specified debt levels for a period of years on some properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Lock-out provisions could materially restrict us from selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P137_S1	These provisions would affect our ability to turn our investments into cash and thus affect cash available for distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P137_S2	Lock out provisions may prohibit us from reducing the outstanding indebtedness with respect to any properties, refinancing such indebtedness on a non-recourse basis at maturity, or increasing the amount of indebtedness with respect to such properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P137_S3	Lock-out provisions could impair our ability to take other actions during the lock-out period that could be in the best interests of our stockholders and, therefore, may have an adverse impact on the value of the shares, relative to the value that would result if the lock-out provisions did not exist.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P137_S4	In particular, lock-out provisions could preclude us from participating in major transactions that could result in a disposition of our assets or a change in control even though that disposition or change in control might be in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P138_S0	Rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Any properties that we buy in the future will be, subject to operating risks common to real estate in general, any or all of which may negatively affect us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P139_S1	If any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses, we could be required to expend funds with respect to that property for operating expenses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P139_S2	The properties will be subject to increases in tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P139_S3	If renewals of leases or future leases are not negotiated on a triple-net-lease basis or do not require the tenants to pay all or a portion of such expenses, we may have to pay those costs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P139_S4	If we are unable to lease properties on a triple-net-lease basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, or if tenants fail to pay required tax, utility and other impositions, we could be required to pay those costs which could adversely affect funds available for future acquisitions or cash available for distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P140_S0	If we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P141_S0	We will carry comprehensive general liability coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties with limits of liability which we deem adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P141_S1	Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we estimate to be adequate to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the rehabilitation period.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Material losses may occur in excess of insurance proceeds with respect to any property, as insurance may not be sufficient to fund the losses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P142_S1	However, there are types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S0	Insurance risks associated with potential terrorism acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S1	Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase specific coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S2	It is uncertain whether such insurance policies will be available, or available at reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our potential properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S3	In these instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S4	We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S5	The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 is designed for a sharing of terrorism losses between insurance companies and the federal government, and extends the federal terrorism insurance backstop through 2014.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S6	We cannot be certain how this act will impact us or what additional cost to us, if any, could result.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P143_S7	If such an event damaged or destroyed one or more of our properties, we could lose both our invested capital and anticipated profits from such property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Real estate related taxes may increase and if these increases are not passed on to tenants, our income will be reduced.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P145_S0	Some local real property tax assessors may seek to reassess some of our properties as a result of our acquisition of the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Generally, from time to time our property taxes increase as property values or assessment rates change or for other reasons deemed relevant by the assessors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P146_S0	An increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes will result in an increase in the related real estate taxes on that property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P146_S1	There is no assurance that renewal leases or future leases will be negotiated on the same basis, even if some tenant leases permit us to pass through such tax increases to the tenants for payment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P146_S2	Increases not passed through to tenants will adversely affect our income, cash available for distributions, and the amount of distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P147_S0	CC Rs may restrict our ability to operate a property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P148_S0	Some of our properties may be contiguous to other parcels of real property, comprising part of the same commercial center.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P148_S1	In connection with such properties, there are significant covenants, conditions and restrictions, known as CC Rs, restricting the operation of such properties and any improvements on such properties, and related to granting easements on such properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P148_S2	Moreover, the operation and management of the contiguous properties may impact such properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P148_S3	Compliance with CC Rs may adversely affect our operating costs and reduce the amount of funds that we have available to pay distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Our operating results may be negatively affected by potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S0	We may use proceeds from our offering to acquire and develop properties upon which we will construct improvements.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S1	We will be subject to uncertainties associated with re-zoning for development, environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups, and our builder s ability to build in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs, and timetables.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S2	If a builder fails to perform, we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S3	A builder s performance also may be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder s control.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S4	Delays in completion of construction could also give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S5	We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S6	These and other such factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S7	In addition, we will be subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S8	We also must rely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a price at the time we acquire the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P150_S9	If our projections are inaccurate, we may pay too much for a property, and our return on our investment could suffer.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P151_S0	We may invest in unimproved real property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P151_S1	For purposes of this paragraph, unimproved real property does not include properties acquired for the purpose of producing rental or other operating income, properties under development or construction, and properties under contract for development or in planning for development within one year.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P151_S2	Returns from development of unimproved properties are also subject to risks associated with re-zoning the land for development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P152_S0	If we invest unimproved property other than property we intend to develop, your investment will be subject to the risks associated with investments in unimproved real property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Competition with third parties in acquiring properties and other investments may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P154_S0	We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, bank and insurance company investment accounts, other REITs, real estate limited partnerships, and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, many of which have greater resources than we do.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P154_S1	Larger REITs may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P154_S2	In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investments may increase.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P154_S3	Any such increase would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P154_S4	If we pay higher prices for properties and other investments, our profitability will be reduced and you may experience a lower return on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Our properties face competition that may affect tenants ability to pay rent and the amount of rent paid to us may affect the cash available for distributions and the amount of distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P156_S0	Our properties typically are, and we expect will be, located in developed areas such as the New York MSA.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P156_S1	Therefore, there are and will be numerous other properties within the market area of each of our properties that will compete with us for tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P156_S2	The number of competitive properties could have a material effect on our ability to rent space at our properties and the amount of rents charged.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P156_S3	We could be adversely affected if additional competitive properties are built in locations competitive with our properties, causing increased competition for customer traffic and creditworthy tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P156_S4	This could result in decreased cash flow from tenants and may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise made, thus affecting cash available for distributions, and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P157_S0	We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Leases representing 21.5% of the total annual rent of our properties will expire in August, October and December 2011.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P158_S1	We cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above our existing rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or tenant-favorable renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P158_S2	If the rental rates of our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to satisfy our principal and interest obligations would be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P158_S3	Moreover, the resale value of our property could be diminished because the market value of the property depends upon the value of the leases of the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Delays in acquisitions of properties may have an adverse effect on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P160_S0	There may be a substantial period of time before the proceeds of our offering are invested.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P160_S1	Delays we encounter in the selection, acquisition and/or development of properties could adversely affect your returns.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P161_S0	Where properties are acquired prior to the start of construction or during the early stages of construction, it will typically take several months to complete construction and rent available space.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Therefore, you could suffer delays in the payment of cash distributions attributable to those particular properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P162_S0	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for any distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P163_S0	All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P163_S1	These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P163_S2	Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P163_S3	In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P164_S0	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P164_S1	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P164_S2	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P164_S3	Additionally, our tenants operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P164_S4	In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply, and that may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P164_S5	Any material expenditures, fines, or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to make distributions and may reduce the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P165_S0	State and federal laws in this area are constantly evolving, and we intend to monitor these laws and take commercially reasonable steps to protect ourselves from the impact of these laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of most properties that we acquire; however, we will not obtain an independent third-party environmental assessment for every property we acquire.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P165_S1	In addition, any such assessment that we do obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities or that a prior owner of a property did not create a material environmental condition not known to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P165_S2	The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims would materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P166_S0	If we sell properties by providing financing to purchasers, defaults by the purchasers would adversely affect our cash flows.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P167_S0	If we decide to sell any of our properties, we intend to use our best efforts to sell them for cash.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P167_S1	However, in some instances we may sell our properties by providing financing to purchasers.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P167_S2	When we provide financing to purchasers, we will bear the risk that the purchaser may default, which could negatively impact our cash distributions to stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P167_S3	Even in the absence of a purchaser default, the distribution of the proceeds of sales to our stockholders, or their reinvestment in other assets, will be delayed until the promissory notes or other property we may accept upon the sale are actually paid, sold, refinanced or otherwise disposed of.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P167_S4	In some cases, we may receive initial down payments in cash and other property in the year of sale in an amount less than the selling price and subsequent payments will be spread over a number of years.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P167_S5	If any purchaser defaults under a financing arrangement with us, it could negatively impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P168_S0	Our recovery of an investment in a mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loan that has defaulted may be limited.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P169_S0	There is no guarantee that the mortgage, loan or deed of trust securing an investment will, following a default, permit us to recover the original investment and interest that would have been received absent a default.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P170_S0	The security provided by a mortgage, deed of trust or loan is directly related to the difference between the amount owed and the appraised market value of the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P170_S1	Even though we intend to rely on a current real estate appraisal when we make the investment, the value of the property is affected by factors outside our control, including general fluctuations in the real estate market, rezoning, neighborhood changes, highway relocations and failure by the borrower to maintain the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P170_S2	In addition, we may incur the costs of litigation in our efforts to enforce our rights under defaulted loans.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P171_S0	Our costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P172_S0	Our properties will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Disabilities Act).
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P172_S1	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P172_S2	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P172_S3	The Disabilities Act s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P173_S0	We will attempt to acquire properties that comply with the Disabilities Act or place the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with the Disabilities Act.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P173_S1	However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P173_S2	If we cannot, our funds used for Disabilities Act compliance may affect cash available for distributions and the amount of distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P174_S0	Economic conditions may adversely affect our income and we could be subject to risks associated with acquiring discounted real estate assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P175_S0	U.S. and international markets are currently experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of many factors, including decreasing values of home prices, limited access to credit markets, higher fuel prices and less consumer spending.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P175_S1	The effects of the current market dislocation may persist as financial institutions continue to take the necessary steps to restructure their business and capital structures.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P175_S2	As a result, this economic downturn has reduced demand for space and removed support for rents and property values.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P176_S0	Since we cannot predict when the real estate markets will recover, the value of our properties may decline if current market conditions persist or worsen.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P177_S0	In addition, we will be subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of discounted real estate assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P177_S1	Such assets may be purchased at a discount from historical cost due to, among other things, substantial deferred maintenance, abandonment, undesirable locations or markets, or poorly structured financing of the real estate or debt instruments underlying the assets, which has since lowered their value.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P177_S2	Further, the continuing instability in the financial markets has limited the availability of lines of credit and the degree to which people and entities have access to cash to pay rents or debt service on the underlying the assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P177_S3	Such illiquidity has the effect of increasing vacancies, increasing bankruptcies and weakening interest rates commercial entities can charge consumers, which can all decrease the value of already discounted real estate assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P177_S4	Should conditions worsen, the continued inability of the underlying real estate assets to produce income may weaken our return on our investments, which, in turn, may weaken your return on investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P178_S0	Further, irrespective of the instability the financial markets may have on the return produced by discounted real estate assets, the evolving efforts to correct the instability make the valuation of such assets highly unpredictable.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P178_S1	The fluctuation in market conditions make judging the future performance of such assets difficult.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P178_S2	There is a risk that we may not purchase real estate assets at absolute discounted rates and that such assets may continue to decline in value.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P179_S0	Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P180_S0	A retail property s revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P180_S1	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our common stock may be negatively impacted.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P181_S0	Some of our leases may provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P181_S1	A number of our retail leases also may include a percentage rent clause for additional rent above the base amount based upon a specified percentage of the sales our tenants generate.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P181_S2	Under those leases which contain percentage rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P182_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P182_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we may derive from percentage rent leases could decline upon a general economic downturn.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P183_S0	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P183_S1	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P184_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P184_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our financial condition.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P185_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant s lease is terminated.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S1	These co-tenancy provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P186_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P187_S0	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P188_S0	If we acquire retail properties, our retail tenants will face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs, internet websites and telemarketing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P188_S1	Other retail centers within the market area of our properties will compete with our properties for customers, affecting their tenants cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P188_S2	In addition, some of our tenants rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P188_S3	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P189_S0	Declines in overall activity in our markets may adversely affect the performance of our office properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P190_S0	Rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P190_S1	Our office properties may be adversely affected by the unprecedented volatility and illiquidity in the financial and credit markets, the general global economic recession, and other market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P190_S2	Because our portfolio will include commercial office buildings located principally in Manhattan, if economic conditions persist or deteriorate, then our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service current debt and to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by the following, among other potential conditions:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P191_S0	reduced liquidity in debt markets and increased credit risk premiums for certain market participants may impair our ability to access capital.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P192_S0	These conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions, may continue or worsen in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P193_S0	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P193_S1	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P193_S2	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P194_S0	The loss of anchor tenants for our office properties could adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P195_S0	We may acquire office properties and, as with our retail properties, we are subject to the risk that tenants may be unable to make their lease payments or may decline to extend a lease upon its expiration.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P195_S1	A lease termination by a tenant that occupies a large area of space in one of our office properties (commonly referred to as an anchor tenant) could impact leases of other tenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P195_S2	Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of a lease termination by an anchor tenant or the closure of the business of an anchor tenant that leaves its space vacant, even if the anchor tenant continues to pay rent.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P195_S3	Any such modifications or conditions could be unfavorable to us as the property owner and could decrease rents or expense recoveries.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P195_S4	In the event of default by an anchor tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P196_S0	The short-term nature of our residential leases may adversely impact our income.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P197_S0	If our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their units.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P197_S1	Because substantially all our residential leases will be for apartments, they generally will be for terms of no more than one or two years.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P197_S2	If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P198_S0	Certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances result in a reduction in rental income.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P199_S0	An economic downturn could adversely affect the residential industry and may affect operations for the residential properties that we acquire.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P200_S0	As a result of the effects of an economic downturn, including increased unemployment rates, the residential industry may experience a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in overall renters.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P200_S1	The current economic downturn and increase in unemployment rates may have an adverse effect on our operations if the tenants occupying the residential and office properties we acquire cease making rent payments to us or if there a change in spending patterns resulting in reduced traffic at the retail properties we acquire.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P200_S2	Moreover, low residential mortgage interest rates could accompany an economic downturn and encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P200_S3	The residential properties we acquire may experience declines in occupancy rate due to any such decline in residential mortgage interest rates.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P201_S0	The hotel industry is very competitive, seasonal and has been affected by economic slowdowns, terrorist attacks and other world events.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P202_S0	The hotel industry is intensely competitive, seasonal in nature and has been affected by the current economic slowdown, terrorist attacks, military activity in the Middle East, natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy and the travel and hotel industries, and, as a result, our lodging properties may be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P202_S1	Since the hotel industry is intensely competitive, our third-party management company and our third-party tenants may be unable to compete successfully or if our competitors marketing strategies are more effective, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders, may be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P202_S2	In particular, as a result of terrorist attacks around the world, the war in Iraq and the effects of the economic recession, subsequent to 2001 the lodging industry experienced a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in both business and leisure travel.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P202_S3	Our business and lodging properties may continue to be affected by such events, including our hotel occupancy levels and average daily rates, and, as a result, our revenues may decrease or not increase to levels we expect.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P203_S0	Since we do not intend to operate our lodging properties, our revenues depend on the ability of our third-party management company and our-third party tenants to compete successfully with other hotels in the New York MSA.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P203_S1	Some of our competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P203_S2	If our third-party management company and our third-party tenants are unable to compete successfully, including competition from Internet intermediaries, or if our competitors marketing strategies are effective, our results of operations, financial condition, ability to service debt and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P204_S0	In addition, the seasonality of the hotel industry can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and also may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, such as extreme or unexpectedly mild weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P205_S0	To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues, we may attempt to borrow in order to make distributions to our stockholders or be required to reduce other expenditures or distributions to stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P206_S0	Our profitability may be adversely affected by unstable market and business conditions and insufficient demand for lodging due to reduced business and leisure travel.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P207_S0	Our hotels will be subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P207_S1	These risks could adversely affect hotel occupancy and the rates that can be charged for hotel rooms as well as hotel operating expenses, and generally include:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P208_S0	risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate, as discussed below.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P209_S0	We do not have control over the market and business conditions that affect the value of our lodging properties, and adverse changes with respect to such conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P209_S1	Hotel properties are subject to varying degrees of risk generally common to the ownership of hotels, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P210_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P211_S0	Adverse changes in any or all these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, thereby adversely impacting our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P212_S0	As a REIT, we cannot directly operate our lodging properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, which could impact our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S0	We cannot and will not directly operate our lodging properties and, as a result, our results of operations, financial position, ability to service debt and our ability to make distributions to stockholders are dependent on the ability of our third-party management companies and our tenants to operate our hotel properties successfully.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S1	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly operate any lodging properties we may acquire or actively participate in the decisions affecting their daily operations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S2	Instead, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, or a TRS lessee, we must enter into management agreements with a third-party management company, or we must lease our lodging properties to third-party tenants on a triple-net lease basis.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S3	We cannot and will not control this third-party management company or the tenants who operate and are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of our lodging properties, including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S4	Thus, even if we believe our lodging properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party management company or the tenants to change their method of operation of our lodging properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S5	Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and our ability to service debt and to make distributions to stockholders are, therefore, dependent on the ability of our third-party management company and tenants to operate our lodging properties successfully.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S6	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator and/or its affiliated brands generally may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and consequently cash flows thereby impacting our ability to service debt, and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P213_S7	There can be no assurance that our affiliate continues to manage any lodging properties we acquire.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S0	We will rely on a third-party hotel management company to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S1	In doing this, the property manager should have policies and procedures in place which allows them to effectively monitor and report to us the operating results of our lodging properties which ultimately are included in our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S2	Because the operations of our lodging properties ultimately become a component of our consolidated financial statements, we evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting at all our properties, including our lodging properties, in connection with the certifications we provide in our quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S3	However, we will not control the design or implementation of or changes to internal controls at any of our lodging properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S4	Thus, even if we believe that our lodging properties are being operated without effective internal controls, we may not be able to require the third-party management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S5	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S6	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S7	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party management company will implement at our lodging properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P214_S8	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at one or more of our lodging properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P215_S0	If we replace a third-party management company or tenant, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement or lease to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at the affected lodging properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P215_S1	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party management company or tenants with substantial prior lodging experience in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P215_S2	If we experience such disruptions, it may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P216_S0	Potential liability as the result of, and the cost of compliance with, environmental matters is greater if we invest in industrial properties or lease our properties to tenants that engage in industrial activities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P217_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on such property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P217_S1	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P218_S0	We may invest in properties historically used for industrial, manufacturing and commercial purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P218_S1	Some of these properties are more likely to contain, or may have contained, underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P218_S2	All of these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P219_S0	Leasing properties to tenants that engage in industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities will cause us to be subject to increased risk of liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P219_S1	The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P220_S0	The demand for and profitability of our industrial properties may be adversely affected by fluctuations in manufacturing activity in the United States.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P221_S0	Our industrial properties may be adversely affected if manufacturing activity decreases in the United States.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P222_S0	Trade agreements with foreign countries have given employers the option to utilize less expensive non-US manufacturing workers.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P222_S1	The outsourcing of manufacturing functions could lower the demand for our industrial properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P222_S2	Moreover, an increase in the cost of raw materials or decrease in the demand of housing could cause a slowdown in manufacturing activity, such as furniture, textiles, machinery and chemical products, and our profitability may be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P223_S0	Our portfolio may be negatively impacted by a high concentration of industrial tenants in a single industry.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P224_S0	If we invest in industrial properties, we may lease properties to tenants that engage in similar industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P224_S1	A high concentration of tenants in a specific industry would magnify the adverse impact that a downturn in such industry might otherwise have to our portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P225_S0	We may incur mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings, which may increase our business risks.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P226_S0	We expect that in most instances, we will acquire real properties by using either existing financing or borrowing new funds.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P226_S1	In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge all or some of our real properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P227_S0	We may borrow if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P227_S1	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P228_S0	Our Advisor believes that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objective of maximizing the return to investors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S0	There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S1	Under our charter, our borrowings may not exceed 300% of our total net assets (as defined by the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S2	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S3	In addition, it is our intention to limit our borrowings to 40% to 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets (calculated after the close of our offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our offering), unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for such excess borrowing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S4	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S5	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S6	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S7	We expect that during the period of our offering we seek independent director approval of borrowings in excess of these limitations since we will then be in the process of raising our equity capital to acquire our portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P229_S8	As a result, we expect that our debt levels will be higher until we have invested most of our capital.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P230_S0	If there is a shortfall between the cash flow from a property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on a property, then the amount available for distributions to stockholders may be reduced.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P230_S1	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P230_S2	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P230_S3	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P230_S4	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P230_S5	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of distributions required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P231_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P231_S1	When we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P232_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P232_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P233_S0	The current state of debt markets could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P234_S0	The domestic and international commercial real estate debt markets are currently experiencing volatility as a result of certain factors including the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P234_S1	This is resulting in lenders increasing the cost for debt financing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P234_S2	Should the overall cost of borrowings increase, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, we will need to factor such increases into the economics of future acquisitions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P234_S3	This may result in future acquisitions generating lower overall economic returns and potentially reducing future cash flow available for distribution.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P234_S4	If these disruptions in the debt markets persist, our ability to borrow monies to finance the purchase of, or other activities related to, real estate assets will be negatively impacted.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P234_S5	If we are unable to borrow monies on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, we likely will have to reduce the number of properties we can purchase, and the return on the properties we do purchase may be lower.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P234_S6	In addition, we may find it difficult, costly or impossible to refinance indebtedness which is maturing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P235_S0	In addition, the state of the debt markets could have an impact on the overall amount of capital investing in real estate which may result in price or value decreases of real estate assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P235_S1	This could negatively impact the current value of our existing assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P236_S0	High mortgage rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire and the amount of cash distributions we can make.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P237_S0	If we place mortgage debt on properties, we run the risk of being unable to refinance the properties when the loans come due, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P237_S1	If interest rates are higher when the properties are refinanced, we may not be able to finance the properties and our income could be reduced.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P237_S2	If any of these events occur, our cash flow would be reduced.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P237_S3	This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution to you and may hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P238_S0	Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P239_S0	In connection with providing us financing, a lender could impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P239_S1	Loan documents we enter into may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property, discontinue insurance coverage or replace New York Recovery Advisors, LLC as our Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P239_S2	These or other limitations may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our investment and operating objectives.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P240_S0	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P241_S0	We expect that we will incur indebtedness in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P241_S1	To the extent that we incur variable rate debt, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay distributions to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P241_S2	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P242_S0	We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S0	Under our charter, our borrowings may not exceed 300% of our total net assets (as defined by the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S1	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S2	In addition, it is our intention to limit our aggregate borrowings to 40% to 50% of the fair market value of all of our assets (calculated after the close of our offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our offering), unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with a justification for such excess borrowing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S3	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S4	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S5	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S6	We expect that during the period of our offering we will seek independent director approval of borrowings in excess of these limitations since we will then be in the process of raising our equity capital to acquire our portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S7	As a result, we expect that our debt levels will be higher until we have invested most of our capital.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S8	High debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges, would result in higher debt service payments and could be accompanied by restrictive covenants.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P243_S9	These factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P244_S0	We may invest in collateralized mortgage-backed securities, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk and the risks of the securitization process.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P245_S0	We may invest in CMBS, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P245_S1	We have not adopted, and do not expect to adopt, any formal policies or procedures designed to manage risks associated with our investments in CMBS.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P246_S0	In this context, credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P247_S0	Interest rate risk occurs as prevailing market interest rates change relative to the current yield on the CMBS.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P247_S1	For example, when interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their existing mortgages to take advantage of the lower cost of financing.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P247_S2	As prepayments occur, principal is returned to the holders of the CMBS sooner than expected, thereby lowering the effective yield on the investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P247_S3	On the other hand, when interest rates rise, borrowers are more likely to maintain their existing mortgages.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P247_S4	As a result, prepayments decrease, thereby extending the average maturity of the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P248_S0	We intend to manage interest rate risk by purchasing CMBS offered in tranches, or with sinking fund features, that are designed to match our investment objectives.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P249_S0	CMBS are also subject to several risks created through the securitization process.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P250_S0	Subordinate CMBS are paid interest only to the extent that there are funds available to make payments.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P250_S1	To the extent the collateral pool includes delinquent loans, there is a risk that the interest payment on subordinate CMBS will not be fully paid.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P250_S2	Subordinate CMBS are also subject to greater credit risk than those CMBS that are more highly rated.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P250_S3	If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you will be adversely affected.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P251_S0	Any real estate debt security that we originate or purchase are subject to the risks of delinquency and foreclosure.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P252_S0	We may originate and purchase real estate debt securities, which are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P252_S1	Typically, we will not have recourse to the personal assets of our borrowers.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P253_S0	The ability of a borrower to repay a real estate debt security secured by an income-producing property depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property, rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P253_S1	If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the real estate debt security may be impaired.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P253_S2	A property s net operating income can be affected by, among other things:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P254_S0	increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P255_S0	We bear the risks of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the real estate debt security, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P256_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a real estate debt security borrower, the real estate debt security to that borrower will be deemed to be collateralized only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the real estate debt security will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P257_S0	Foreclosure of a real estate debt security can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed real estate debt security.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P257_S1	We also may be forced to foreclose on certain properties, be unable to sell these properties and be forced to incur substantial expenses to improve operations at the property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P258_S0	Failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P259_S0	We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT beginning with the tax year ending December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S0	In order for us to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy certain requirements set forth in the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury Regulations and various factual matters and circumstances that are not entirely within our control.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S1	We intend to structure our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all of these requirements.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S2	However, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization could jeopardize our ability to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S3	Proskauer Rose LLP, our tax counsel, has rendered its opinion that we will qualify as a REIT, based upon our representations as to the manner in which we are and will be owned, invest in assets and operate, among other things.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S4	However, our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, through investments, actual operating results, distributions and satisfaction of specific rules, the various tests imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S5	Proskauer Rose LLP will not review these operating results or compliance with the qualification standards on an ongoing basis.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S6	This means that we may fail to satisfy the REIT requirements in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S7	Also, this opinion represents Proskauer Rose LLP s legal judgment based on the law in effect as of the date of the prospectus contained in our Registration Statement at the time it was first declared effective by the SEC.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S8	Proskauer Rose LLP s opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and we will not apply for a ruling from the IRS regarding our status as a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P260_S9	Future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P261_S0	If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P261_S1	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT status.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P261_S2	Losing our REIT status would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P261_S3	In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P261_S4	If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P262_S0	To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P262_S1	This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P263_S0	To obtain the favorable tax treatment accorded to REITs under the Internal Revenue Code, we generally will be required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain), determined without regard to the deduction for distributions paid.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P263_S1	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income, (ii) 95% of our capital gain net income and (iii) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P263_S2	These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P263_S3	It is possible that we might not always be able to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P264_S0	You may have current tax liability on distributions you elect to reinvest in our common stock but would not receive the cash from such distributions to pay such tax liability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P265_S0	If you participate in our distribution reinvestment plan, you will be deemed to have received, and for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed on, the amount reinvested in common stock to the extent the amount reinvested was not a tax-free return of capital.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P265_S1	As a result, unless you are a tax-exempt entity, you may have to use funds from other sources to pay your tax liability on the value of the common stock received.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P266_S0	There is a risk that you may receive shares of our common stock as dividends and thereby have a current tax liability without receiving the cash to pay such tax liability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P267_S0	We have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend for the purpose of fulfilling our REIT distribution requirements in shares of our common stock instead of in cash.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P267_S1	As long as a portion of such dividend is paid in cash (which portion could potentially be as low as 10%) and certain requirements are met, the entire distribution will be treated as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P267_S2	As a result, a stockholder would be taxed on 100% of the dividend in the same manner as a cash dividend, even though most of the dividend was paid in shares of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P267_S3	Stockholders who receive a disproportionate amount of cash in the dividend under election procedures may experience greater dilution than other stockholders if we elect to distribute our common stock as a dividend.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P268_S0	Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P269_S0	Our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition is restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT status.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P269_S1	Under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, we will be subject to a 100% tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P270_S0	Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P270_S1	No assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business, even if we (i) conduct activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such subsidiaries will incur income taxes), (ii) conduct our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary other than a TRS, will be treated as a prohibited transaction, or (iii) structure certain dispositions of our properties to comply with certain safe harbors available under the Internal Revenue Code for properties held for at least two years.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P271_S0	In certain circumstances, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as a REIT, which would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P272_S0	Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P272_S1	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are dealer properties sold by a REIT (a prohibited transaction under the Internal Revenue Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P273_S0	We may not be able to make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P273_S1	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay income tax directly on such income.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P273_S2	In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P273_S3	However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P274_S0	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, either directly or at the level of New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P274_S1	Any taxes we pay will reduce our cash available for distribution to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P275_S0	The use of TRSs, which may be required for REIT qualification purposes, would increase our overall tax liability and thereby reduce our cash available for distribution to you.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P276_S0	Some of our assets (e.g., hotel properties) may need to be owned or sold, or operations conducted, by TRSs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P276_S1	Any of our TRSs will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P276_S2	The after-tax net income of our TRSs would be available for distribution to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P276_S3	Further, we will incur a 100% excise tax on transactions with our TRSs that are not conducted on an arm s length basis.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P276_S4	For example, to the extent that the rent paid by one of our TRSs exceeds an arm s length rental amount, such amount is potentially subject to the excise tax.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P276_S5	No assurance can be given that all transactions between us and our TRSs will be conducted on an arm s length basis, and that, therefore, no amounts paid by our TRSs to us will be subject to the excise tax.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P277_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P278_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P278_S1	The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P278_S2	In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P278_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P278_S4	As a result, we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P278_S5	These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P279_S0	Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect the returns to our investors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P280_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P280_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P280_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P280_S3	You are urged to consult with your own tax adviser with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P280_S4	You also should note that our counsel s tax opinion was based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P281_S0	Even though REITs continue to receive substantially better tax treatment than entities taxed as corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be taxed for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P281_S1	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P281_S2	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P282_S0	If the operating partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership, its income may be subject to taxation.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P283_S0	We intend to maintain the status of the operating partnership as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P283_S1	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of the operating partnership as a partnership for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P283_S2	In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P283_S3	This would also result in our losing REIT status, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our own income.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P283_S4	This would substantially reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the yield on your investment.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P283_S5	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P283_S6	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain REIT status.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P284_S0	Distributions to foreign investors may be treated as an ordinary income distribution to the extent that it is made out of current or accumulated earnings and profits.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P285_S0	In general, foreign investors will be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax with respect to their investment in our stock if the income derived there from is effectively connected with the foreign investor s conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P285_S1	A distribution to a foreign investor that is not attributable to gain realized by us from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest within the meaning of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, as amended, or FIRPTA, and that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend, will be treated as an ordinary income distribution to the extent that it is made out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes).
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P285_S2	Generally, any ordinary income distribution will be subject to a U.S. federal income tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution, unless this tax is reduced by the provisions of an applicable treaty.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P286_S0	Foreign purchasers of our common stock may be subject to FIRPTA tax upon the sale of their shares or upon the payment of a capital gain dividend.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P287_S0	A foreign person disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests, is generally subject to the FIRPTA tax on the gain recognized on the disposition.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P287_S1	Such FIRPTA tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is domestically controlled.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P288_S0	A REIT is domestically controlled if less than 50% of the REIT s stock, by value, has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying U.S. persons during a continuous five-year period ending on the date of disposition or, if shorter, during the entire period of the REIT s existence.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P288_S1	We cannot assure you that we will qualify as a domestically controlled REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P289_S0	A foreign investor also may be subject to FIRPTA tax upon the payment of any capital gain dividend by us, which dividend is attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P289_S1	We encourage you to consult your own tax advisor to determine the tax consequences applicable to you if you are a foreign investor.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P290_S0	In order to avoid triggering additional taxes and/or penalties, if you intend to invest in our shares through pension or profit-sharing trusts or IRAs, you should consider additional factors.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P291_S0	Our management has attempted to structure us in such a manner that we will be an attractive investment vehicle for pension, profit-sharing, 401(k), Keogh and other qualified retirement plans and IRAs.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P291_S1	However, in considering an investment in our shares, those involved with making such an investment decision should consider applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P291_S2	While each of the ERISA and Internal Revenue Code issues discussed below may not apply to all such plans and IRAs, individuals involved with making investment decisions with respect to such plans and IRAs should carefully review the items described below, and determine their applicability to their situation.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P291_S3	Any such prospective investors are required to consult their own legal and tax advisors on these matters.
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P292_S0	In general, individuals making investment decisions with respect to such plans and IRAs should, at a minimum, consider:
1474464_11_ITEM1A_P293_S0	whether the investment would constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code, if applicable.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we owned six properties located in New York City.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	These properties are 100% occupied with a weighted average remaining lease term of 6.0 years as of December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	In the aggregate, these properties represent approximately 91,000 rentable square feet.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	The following table presents certain additional information about the properties we own at December 31, 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	Remaining lease term in years as of December 31, 2010, calculated on a weighted-average basis.

1474464_11_ITEM2_P5_S0	Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Company engaged an unaffiliated third-party real estate firm to re-measure the rentable square footage of this building.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P5_S1	This activity is a standard practice that generally occurs following an acquisition.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P5_S2	In connection with this re-measurement, it was determined the property contained approximately 81,000 rentable square feet, or 28% more than the amount represented by the seller of this building.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P6_S0	Non-controlling interest members contributed $13.0 million to purchase this portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P7_S0	The following table presents certain debt information about the properties we own at December 31, 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):

1474464_11_ITEM2_P12_S2	The new terms, effective April 2011, include a reduction in monthly rent and an increase in annual contractual rent escalations.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P13_S0	The following table presents future minimum base rent payments, on a cash-basis, due to us over the next ten years and thereafter at the properties we own as of December 31, 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM2_P14_S0	The following is a summary of lease expirations for the next ten years at the properties we own as of December 31, 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM2_P15_S0	The following table lists tenants whose square footage is greater than 10% of the total portfolio square footage as of December 31, 2010 (annual rent in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM2_P16_S0	Remaining lease term in years as of December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P17_S0	If the tenant has multiple leases with varying lease expirations, remaining lease term is calculated on a weighted-average basis.
1474464_11_ITEM2_P18_S0	Annualized rental income as of December 31, 2010 for the tenant on a straight-line basis.
1474464_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	We are not party to, and none of our properties are subject to, any material pending legal proceedings.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	No public market currently exists for our shares of common stock, and we currently have no plans to list our shares on a national securities exchange.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	Until our shares are listed, if ever, our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum purchase requirements.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	In addition, our charter prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% of our stock, unless exempted by our board of directors.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P0_S3	Consequently, there is the risk that our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at a time or price acceptable to them.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P0_S4	Pursuant to our offering, we are selling shares of our common stock to the public at a price of $10.00 per share and at $9.50 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	In order for Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ) members and their associated persons to participate in the offering and sale of shares of common stock pursuant to our offering, we are required pursuant to NASD Rule 2710(f)(2)(M) to disclose in each annual report distributed to stockholders a per share estimated value of the shares, the method by which it was developed and the date of the data used to develop the estimated value.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	In addition, we prepare annual statements of estimated share values to assist fiduciaries of retirement plans subject to the annual reporting requirements of ERISA in the preparation of their reports relating to an investment in our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P1_S2	During our offering the value of the shares is deemed to be the offering price of $10.00 per share (without regard to purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers), as adjusted for any special distribution of net sales proceeds.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P1_S3	There is no public trading market for the shares at this time, and there can be no assurance that stockholders would receive $10.00 per share if such a market did exist and they sold their shares or that they will be able to receive such amount for their shares in the future.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P1_S4	Nor does this deemed value reflect the distributions that stockholders would be entitled to receive if our properties were sold and the sale proceeds were distributed upon liquidation of our Company.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P1_S5	Such a distribution upon liquidation may be less than $10.00 per share primarily due to the fact that the funds initially available for investment in properties were reduced from the gross offering proceeds in order to pay selling commissions and dealer manager fees, organization and offering expenses, and acquisitions and advisory fees.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of March 15, 2011, we had 727,480 shares of common stock outstanding held by a total of 219 stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	We have elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P3_S2	The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors declared a distribution rate equal to a 6.05% annualized rate based on the common share price of $10.00, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	The distributions will be payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P4_S2	The dividend will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P4_S3	On January 5, 2011, we paid $10,661 in distributions to common stockholders of record on December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P5_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	We, our board of directors and Advisor share a similar philosophy with respect to paying our distribution.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P6_S1	The distribution should principally be derived from cash flows generated from real estate operations.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P6_S2	In order to improve our operating cash flows and our ability to pay dividends from operating cash flows, our related party Advisor agreed to waive certain fees including asset management and property management fees.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S0	The Company pays the Advisor an annualized asset management fee of up to 0.75% based on the aggregate contract purchase price of all real estate investments.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S1	The Advisor has elected to waive its asset and property management fees of approximately $0.2 million related to the year ended December 31, 2010, and will determine if a portion or all of such fees will be waived in subsequent periods on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S2	The fees that were waived relating to the year ended December 31, 2010 are not deferrals and accordingly, will not be paid by the Company.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S3	Because the Advisor waived certain fees that we owed, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor was available to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S4	In certain instances, to improve our working capital, the Advisor may elect to absorb a portion of our general and administrative costs that would otherwise have been paid by us.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S5	Additionally, the Advisor at its election may contribute capital to enhance our cash position for distribution purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S6	Any contributed capital amounts are not reimbursable to our Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S7	Further, any capital contributions are made without any corresponding issuance of common or preferred shares of beneficial interest.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P7_S8	The Advisor contributed approximately $0.1 million to us during the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P8_S0	Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( FFO ), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a real estate investment trust, or REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P8_S1	The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P9_S0	FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P10_S0	We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004, or the White Paper.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P10_S1	The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property but including asset impairment write downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P10_S2	Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P10_S3	Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P11_S0	The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P11_S1	Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, we believe, may be less informative.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P11_S2	As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which is not immediately apparent from net income.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P12_S0	However, changes in the accounting and reporting rules under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that have been put into effect since the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in the non-cash and non-operating items included in FFO.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P12_S1	In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives, and impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as items which are typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P12_S2	Lastly, publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation and therefore require additional adjustments to FFO in evaluating performance.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P12_S3	Due to these and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association ( IPA ), an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as Modified FFO ("MFFO"), which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P12_S4	The use of MFFO is recommended by the IPA as a supplemental performance measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P13_S0	MFFO is a metric used by management to evaluate sustainable performance and dividend policy.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P14_S0	MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P15_S0	We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P15_S1	The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; nonrecurring impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P15_S2	Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P15_S3	In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to non-controlling interests with an additional adjustment to add back amounts received or receivable from the Advisor or its affiliates in the form of an additional capital contribution (without any corresponding issuance of equity in the form of common or preferred shares of beneficial interest to the Advisor or its affiliates).
1474464_11_ITEM5_P16_S0	Presentation of this information is intended to assist in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P16_S1	Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P16_S2	FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other measurements as an indication of our performance.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P17_S0	Our calculation of FFO and MFFO is presented in the following table for the applicable periods during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P17_S1	We did not have FFO or MFFO for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009 (in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM5_P18_S0	The following table compares cumulative distributions paid to cumulative MFFO, FFO and net loss (in accordance with GAAP) for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) through December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM5_P19_S0	Calculated in accordance with the IPA recommended format.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P20_S0	Cash used to pay our distributions was generated mainly from funds received from property operating results, a contribution from our Advisor and the sale of our preferred and common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P20_S1	As additional capital is raised and we continue to build our portfolio of investments, we expect that we will use funds received from operating activities to pay a greater proportion of our distributions and will be able to reduce and in the future eliminate the use of funds from the sale of common stock to pay distributions .
1474464_11_ITEM5_P20_S2	As the cash flows from operations become more significant our Advisor may discontinue its past practice of forgiving fees and providing contributions and may charge the full fee owed to it in accordance with our agreements with the Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P21_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P21_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P22_S0	Our Preferred Shares pay cumulative dividends monthly in arrears at the annualized rate of 8% on the liquidation preference of $9.00, resulting in a dividend rate of 8.23%.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P22_S1	The following table reflects dividends paid and declared on Preferred Shares during the year ended December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM5_P23_S0	On January 15, 2011, we paid approximately $0.1 million of dividends to preferred stockholders of record on December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P24_S0	The following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to preferred stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM5_P25_S0	We have a stock option plan (the Plan ) which authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options to our independent directors, subject to the absolute discretion of the board of directors and the applicable limitations of the Plan.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P25_S1	The exercise price for all stock options granted under the Plan will be fixed at $10.00 per share until the termination of the IPO, and thereafter the exercise price for stock options granted to the independent directors will be equal to the fair market value of a share on the last business day preceding the annual meeting of stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P25_S2	A total of 500,000 shares have been authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P26_S0	Notwithstanding any other provisions of our Plan to the contrary, no stock option issued pursuant thereto may be exercised if such exercise would jeopardize our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P27_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our stock option plan as of December 31, 2010:
1474464_11_ITEM5_P28_S0	On September 22, 2010, the Board of Directors adopted an employee and director incentive restricted share plan (the RSP ).
1474464_11_ITEM5_P28_S1	The RSP provides for the automatic grant of 3,000 restricted shares of common stock to each of the independent directors, without any further action by our board of directors or the stockholders, on the date of each annual stockholder s meeting.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P28_S2	Restricted stock issued to independent directors will vest over a five-year period following the first anniversary of the date of grant in increments of 20% per annum.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P29_S0	The RSP provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain of our consultants and certain consultants to the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P29_S1	The total number of common shares reserved for issuance under the RSP is equal to 5.0% of our authorized shares.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P30_S0	Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive common shares from us under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P30_S1	Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient s employment or other relationship us.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P31_S0	Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P31_S1	Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P31_S2	Any distributions payable in common shares shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P32_S0	There were 9,000 unvested shares outstanding under the RSP at December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P33_S0	On September 2, 2010, our Registration Statement covering a public offering of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock for up to $10.00 per share, for an aggregate offering price of up to $1.5 billion, was declared effective under the Securities Act.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P33_S1	The offering commenced on September 2, 2010 and is ongoing.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P33_S2	Shares are offered in our public offering initially at a price of $10.00 per share.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P33_S3	Shares are offered under our distribution reinvestment plan initially at a price of $9.50 per share.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P34_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009, we had sold 327,499 shares and 20,000 shares for gross offering proceeds of $2.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P34_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had incurred selling commissions, dealer manager fees and other organization and offering costs in the amounts set forth below.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P34_S2	The Dealer Manager reallowed all of the selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P35_S0	The following table reflects the offering costs associated with this issuance of common stock (in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM5_P36_S0	Other organization and offering costs include non-recurring legal and due diligence fees related to the initial process of acquiring our Registration Statement effective.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P36_S1	As of December 31, 2010, total expenses exceeded offering proceeds from the sale of common stock by $0.4 million, due to the on-going nature of our offering process and that many expenses were paid before the offering commenced.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P36_S2	We will use the net proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering to purchase or fund real estate investments, including acquisition fees and closing costs.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P37_S0	On December 22, 2009, we commenced a private offering to accredited investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 of up to $50.0 million in shares of our 8% series A convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares ) subject to an option to increase the offering up to $100.0 million in shares of our preferred stock.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P37_S1	This private offering was terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the registration statement with respect to our common shares.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P37_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had received aggregate gross offering proceeds, net of certain discounts, of approximately $17.0 million from the sale of approximately 2.0 million shares in this private offering.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P37_S3	The Preferred Shares are convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock after September 2, 2011, the first anniversary of the final closing of the private offering at a conversion price of $9.00 per share (subject to discounts to a price not less than $8.50).
1474464_11_ITEM5_P38_S0	The following table reflects the offering costs associated with this issuance of Preferred Shares (in thousands) :
1474464_11_ITEM5_P39_S0	Through December 31, 2010, the net offering proceeds to us, after deducting the total expenses paid as described above, were $13.9 million.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P39_S1	We used the net proceeds from this private offering to fund a portion of the $66.3 million of real estate acquisitions.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P40_S0	On October 16, 2009, we sold 20,000 shares of our common stock to our Sponsor under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 at a price of $10.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $0.2 million, which was used to fund organizational costs.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P40_S1	Other than this initial unregistered sale and the private offering of Preferred Shares described above, during the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009, we did not sell equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P41_S0	Our common stock is currently not listed on a national securities exchange and we will not seek to list our stock until such time as our independent directors believe that the listing of our stock would be in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P41_S1	In order to provide stockholders with the benefit of some interim liquidity, our board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program (the SRP ) that enables our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after you have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P41_S2	Our Sponsor, Advisor, directors and affiliates are prohibited from receiving a fee on any share repurchases.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P41_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we had no shares eligible for repurchase as the one-year holding requirement had not yet been met.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P42_S0	Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at our sole discretion and generally will be made quarterly.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P42_S1	We will limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 st of the previous calendar year.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P42_S2	In addition, we are only authorized to repurchase shares using the proceeds received from our distribution reinvestment plan and will limit the amount we spend to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the amount of proceeds we received from our distribution reinvestment plan in that same quarter.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P42_S3	Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P43_S0	Unless the shares of our common stock are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below until we establish an estimated value of our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P43_S1	We do not currently anticipate obtaining appraisals for our investments (other than investments in transactions with our Sponsor, Advisor, directors or their respective affiliates) and, accordingly, the estimated value of our investments should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P43_S2	We expect to begin establishing an estimated value of our shares based on the value of our real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of our offering.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P43_S3	We will retain persons independent of us and our Advisor to prepare the estimated value of our shares.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P44_S0	Only those stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions may be able to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P44_S1	In other words, once our shares are transferred for value by a stockholder, the transferee and all subsequent holders of the shares are not eligible to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P45_S0	We will repurchase shares as of the last business day of each quarter (and in all events on a date other than a dividend payment date).
1474464_11_ITEM5_P45_S1	Prior to establishing the estimated value of our shares, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows:
1474464_11_ITEM5_P46_S0	the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least four years (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_11_ITEM5_P47_S0	Upon the death or disability of a stockholder, upon request, we will waive the one-year holding requirement.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P47_S1	Shares repurchased in connection with the death or disability of a stockholder will be repurchased at a purchase price equal to the price actually paid for the shares during the offering, or if not engaged in the offering, the per share purchase price will be based on the greater of $10.00 or the then-current net asset value of the shares as determined by our board of directors (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_11_ITEM5_P47_S2	In addition, we may waive the holding period in the event of a stockholder s bankruptcy or other exigent circumstances.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P48_S0	The share repurchase program immediately will terminate if our shares are listed on any national securities exchange.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P48_S1	In addition, our board of directors may amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM5_P48_S2	Further, our board of directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any requests for repurchases.
1474464_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following selected financial data as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below:
1474464_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements of American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. and the notes thereto.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Please see Forward-Looking Statements above for a description of these risks and uncertainties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation intending to elect and qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year that ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	To maintain REIT status, we will be required, among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, as defined by the Code, to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	On September 2, 2010, we commenced our IPO on a best efforts basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock (exclusive of 25.0 million shares available pursuant to our DRIP) at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-11 filed with the SEC under the Securities Act.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We sold 20,000 shares to our Sponsor on October 16, 2009, at $10.00 per share.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we had 327,499 shares of common stock outstanding with an aggregate value of approximately $3.2 million based on a per share value of $10.00.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	In addition, we sold approximately 2.0 million shares of Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million in the Preferred Offering.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	We are dependent upon the net proceeds from these offerings to conduct our operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	We were formed to acquire high quality, income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by the Company alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	We purchased our first property, the Interior Design Building (the Design Center ), and commenced our real estate operations in June 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	On December 1, 2010, we purchased a portfolio of five retail condominiums on Bleecker Street ( Bleecker Street ).
1474464_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	As of December 31, 2010, the Company owned six properties comprising approximately 91,000 square feet of commercial space with an aggregate purchase price of $66.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P4_S6	As of December 31, 2010, these properties were 100% occupied.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP, a Delaware limited partnership.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	We are the sole general partner and holder of 99.9% of the units of the OP.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our Advisor made a capital contribution to the OP in the amount of $2,000 in exchange for 200 OP units, which may be exchanged for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at our option, a corresponding number of shares of common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	We are managed by our Advisor and Sponsor, which serves as our Property Manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our Dealer Manager, an affiliate of the Sponsor, serves as the dealer manager of our IPO.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	These related parties receive compensation and fees for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of our assets.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Real estate-related investments are higher-yield and higher-risk investments that our Advisor will actively manage, if we elect to acquire such investments.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	The real estate-related investments in which we may invest include: (i) mortgage loans; (ii) equity securities such as common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible preferred securities of real estate companies; (iii) debt securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgages, mortgage loan participations and debt securities issued by other real estate companies; and (iv) certain types of illiquid securities, such as mezzanine loans and bridge loans.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Since our inception, we have not acquired any real estate-related investments.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Investments in real estate are recorded at cost.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to forty years for buildings, 15 years for improvements, five to ten years for fixtures and improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale on the balance sheet.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Long-lived assets are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted or when they are designated as held for sale.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Valuation of real estate is considered a critical accounting estimate because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value, and therefore, the carrying amounts of our real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	Additionally, decisions regarding when a property should be classified as held for sale are also highly subjective and require significant management judgment.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Events or changes in circumstances that could cause an evaluation for impairment include the following:
1474464_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We review our portfolio on an on-going basis to evaluate the existence of any of the aforementioned events or changes in circumstances that would require us to test for recoverability.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	In general, our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value expected, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	Tangible assets include land, buildings, equipment and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Amounts allocated to land, buildings, equipment and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third-parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of forty years for buildings, seven years for building equipment and fixtures, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The aggregate value of intangibles assets related to customer relationship is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from 2 to 20 years.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	The allocations presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are substantially complete; however, there are certain items that we will finalize once we receive additional information.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	Accordingly, these allocations are subject to revision when final information is available, although we do not expect future revisions to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the guidance on transfers of financial assets to, among other things, eliminate the qualifying special-purpose entity concept, include a new unit of account definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, clarify and change the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, and require significant additional disclosure.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	This standard was effective January 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which revised the consolidation guidance for variable-interest entities.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The modifications include the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable-interest entity.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	This standard was effective January 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies that the stock portion of a distribution to stockholders that allow them to receive cash or stock with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all stockholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a share issuance that is reflected in earnings per share prospectively and is not a stock dividend.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	This standard was effective January 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	In January 2010, the FASB amended guidance to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Specifically, the guidance revises two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarifies two others.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	It requires separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	Also, it requires the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within Level 3 on a gross basis rather than on a net basis.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P36_S4	The amendments clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P36_S5	The adoption of the guidance related to Levels 1 and 2 were effective January 1, 2010 and did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P36_S6	The adoption of the guidance related to Level 3 is effective January 1, 2011 and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	In February 2010, the FASB updated the guidance to no longer require companies that file with the SEC to indicate the date through which they have analyzed subsequent events.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	This updated guidance became effective immediately upon issuance; therefore we adopted it as of the first quarter of 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	In March 2010, the FASB issued a clarification of previous guidance that exempts certain credit related features from analysis as potential embedded derivatives subject to bifurcation and separate fair value accounting.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	This guidance specifies that an embedded credit derivative feature related to the transfer of credit risk that is only in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another is not subject to bifurcation from a host contract.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	All other embedded credit derivative features should be analyzed to determine whether their economic characteristics and risks are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and whether bifurcation and separate fair value accounting is required.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	The adoption of this guidance on July 1, 2010 had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	In December 2010, the FASB updated its guidance related to goodwill which affected all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	The guidance modifies Step 1 so that for those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P40_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance, which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P40_S2	This guidance will become effective for us on January 1, 2011.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P40_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	In December 2010, the FASB updated the guidance related to business combinations to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The amendment specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The amendment affects any public entity, as defined, that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	This guidance will become effective for us for acquisitions occurring on or after January 1, 2011.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	We do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we owned six properties which are 100% leased.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2009, we did not own any properties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P43_S2	Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009 reflect significant increases in most categories.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	Rental income was $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	Rental income was driven by our acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2010 of $66.3 million of properties, representing approximately 91,000 square feet, which were 100% leased as of December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P44_S2	We did not own any properties and therefore, had no rental income for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Operating expense reimbursement revenue was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	This revenue represents the portion of property operating expenses which are reimbursable by our tenants and primarily relates to the Design Center acquisition.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P45_S2	We did not own any properties and therefore, had no operating expense reimbursement revenue for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Our Advisor is entitled to fees for the management of our properties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Advisor has elected to waive all asset management fees for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, we would have incurred additional asset management fees of $0.2 million, had they not been waived.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	There were no fees earned or waived for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our affiliated Property Manager, has elected to waive the property management fees for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Such fees represent amounts that, had they not been waived, would have been paid to our Property Manager to manage and lease our properties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P47_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, we would have incurred property management fees of $0.1 million, had the fees not been waived.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P47_S3	There were no property management fees incurred or waived for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $0.7 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	These costs primarily relate to the costs associated with maintaining the Design Center property including real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance and unaffiliated third party property management fees.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	There were no properties purchased and therefore no property expenses for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Acquisition and transaction related costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $1.4 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	These costs related to the purchase of six properties acquired in 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of $66.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	There were no properties purchased and therefore no acquisition and transaction-related costs for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	General and administrative expenses of $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily included board member compensation.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P50_S1	General and administrative expenses for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 200 were immaterial.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to the purchase of six properties acquired in 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of $66.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	The purchase price of acquired properties is allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	There were no properties purchased and therefore no depreciation and amortization expense for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Interest expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, related to financing of a portion of the properties acquired in 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	We view these secured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	There were no properties purchased and therefore no interest expense for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the level of proceeds raised in our offering, the cost of borrowings, and the opportunity to acquire real estate assets which meet our investment objectives.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 represents the 13.8% of the net loss, excluding depreciation and amortization, on our Bleecker Street property that is related to minority interest holders.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	There were no properties purchased and therefore no net loss attributable to non-controlling interests for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in operating activities was $1.2 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P56_S1	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P56_S2	Cash flows used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 was mainly due to a net loss of $1.8 million, primarily related to acquisition costs and increases in prepaid expenses of $0.7 million primarily due to the prepayments of real estate taxes and the increase in unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with straight-line basis accounting, as well as the receivable from affiliates of $0.4 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P56_S3	These uses in cash were partially offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.4 million and an increase in deferred rent and other liabilities of $0.2 million, primarily representing rent payments received in advance of the respective due date.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P56_S4	Non cash adjustments to net cash used in operating activities primarily related to depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets of $1.0 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million, offset by a net loss attributable to minority interest holders of $0.1 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Net cash used in investing activities during the year December 31, 2010 of $52.0 million related to properties acquired during the period.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Net cash provided by financing activities of $53.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 related to proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Shares and common stock of $19.8 million, proceeds from mortgage notes payable of $21.3 million, proceeds from minority interest holders and the Advisor of $13.1 million and proceeds from other notes payable of $8.9 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	These amounts were partially offset by offering costs of $3.7 million, repayments of mortgage and other notes payable of $3.0 million, dividends paid of $0.7 million, payments of deferred financing costs of $1.3 million and restricted cash of $0.8 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	Cash provided by financing activities in 2010 was used for property acquisitions.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	During the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009, cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the sale of common stock of $0.2 million, which was offset of by $0.2 million of payments related to offering costs.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Our principal demands for funds will continue to be for property acquisitions, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses, distributions to our investors, repurchases under our SRP, and for the payment of interest on our outstanding indebtedness.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Generally, cash needs for property acquisitions will be met through proceeds from the sale of common stock through our public offering.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	We may also from time to time enter into other agreements with third parties where by third parties will make equity investments in specific properties or groups of properties that we acquire.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Items other than property acquisitions are expected to be met from a combination of the proceeds from the sale of common stock and cash flows from operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	We expect to meet our future short-term operating liquidity requirements through a combination of net cash provided by our current property operations and the operations of properties to be acquired in the future and proceeds from the sale of common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P62_S1	Management expects that in the future, as our portfolio grows, our properties will generate sufficient cash flow to cover operating expenses and the payment of a monthly distribution.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P62_S2	Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from private offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	We expect to continue to raise capital through the sale of our common stock and to utilize the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and proceeds from secured financings to complete future property acquisitions.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had issued approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $2.9 million and approximately 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Our board of directors has adopted a SRP that enables our stockholders to sell their shares to us under limited circumstances.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	At the time a stockholder requests a redemption, we may, subject to certain conditions, redeem the shares presented for repurchase for cash to the extent we have sufficient funds available to fund such purchase.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	As of December 31, 2010 we had no shares eligible for repurchase as the one year holding requirement has not been met.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	We expect cash flows from operations and the sale of common stock to be used primarily to invest in additional real estate, pay debt service, pay operating expenses and pay stockholder distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Our Advisor evaluates potential acquisitions of real estate and real estate related assets and engages in negotiations with sellers and borrowers on our behalf.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	Investors should be aware that after a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence and negotiation of final binding agreements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from common stock offerings in certain investments that could yield lower returns than the properties.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	Operating cash flows are expected to increase as additional properties are acquired in our investment portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors declared a distribution rate equal to a 6.05% annualized rate based on the common share price of $10.00, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	The distributions will be payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P68_S2	The dividend will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P68_S3	On January 5, 2011, we paid distributions of $10,661 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	We, our board of directors and Advisor share a similar philosophy with respect to paying our distribution.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	The distribution should principally be derived from cash flows generated from real estate operations.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	In order to improve our operating cash flows and our ability to pay dividends from operating cash flows, our related party Advisor agreed to waive certain fees including asset management and property management fees.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	Because the Advisor waived certain fees that we owed, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor was available to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S4	See Note 10 Related Party transactions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for more information on fees that were forgiven by our Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S5	The fees that were forgiven relating to the activity during the year ended December 31, 2010 are not deferrals and accordingly, will not be paid by us.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S6	In certain instances, to improve our working capital, the Advisor may elect to absorb a portion of our general and administrative costs that would otherwise have been paid by us.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S7	Additionally, the Advisor at its election may contribute capital to enhance our cash position for distribution purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S8	Any contributed capital amounts are not reimbursable to our Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S9	Further, any capital contributions are made without any corresponding issuance of common or preferred shares of beneficial interest.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P70_S10	The Advisor contributed approximately $0.1 million to us during the three months ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	As our real estate portfolio grows, we expect cash flows from operations to cover a more significant portion of our dividend distributions and over time to cover the entire distribution.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	As the cash flows from operations become more significant our Advisor may discontinue its past practice of forgiving fees and may charge the full fee owed to it in accordance with our agreements with the Advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	Preferred Shares pay cumulative dividends monthly in arrears at the annualized rate of 8% on the liquidation preference of $9.00, resulting in a dividend rate of 8.23%.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	The payment terms of our loan obligations require principal and interest amounts payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	Our loan agreements stipulate that we comply with specific reporting covenants.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Our Advisor may, with approval from our independent board of directors, seek to borrow short-term capital that, combined with secured mortgage financing, exceeds our targeted leverage ratio.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P74_S1	Such short-term borrowings may be obtained from third-parties on a case-by-case basis as acquisition opportunities present themselves simultaneous with our capital raising efforts.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P74_S2	We view the use of short-term borrowings as an efficient and accretive means of acquiring real estate in advance of raising equity capital.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P74_S3	Accordingly, we can take advantage of buying opportunities as we expand our fund raising activities.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P74_S4	As additional equity capital is obtained, these short-term borrowings will be repaid.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P74_S5	Our leverage ratio approximated 53.4% (secured mortgage notes payable as a percentage of total real estate investments, at cost) as of December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 (in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, and so long as we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_11_ITEM7_P78_S2	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P78_S3	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, including common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P78_S4	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	We have entered into agreements with American Realty Capital III, LLC and its wholly-owned affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees or reimbursements to our Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, sales commissions, dealer manager fees, asset and property management fees and reimbursement of operating costs.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.
1474464_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Our long-term debt, which consists of secured financings, bears interest at fixed rates.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes in earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars, and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our debt included fixed-rate debt, with a carrying value of $35.4 million and a fair value of $35.4 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the debt, but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our debt to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2010 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $0.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P3_S2	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $0.3 million.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P3_S3	At December 31, 2010, we do not have any variable rate debt.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and, assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2010, it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As a result, the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.
1474464_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.
1474464_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	The information required by this Item 8 is hereby incorporated by reference to our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1474464_11_ITEM9_P0_S0	Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of such period, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	In connection with the preparation of our Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making that assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	The rules of the SEC do not require, and this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1474464_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	During the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_11_ITEM10_P0_S0	We have adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all of our executive officers and directors, including but not limited to, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer.
1474464_11_ITEM10_P0_S1	A copy of our code of ethics may be obtained, free of charge, by sending a written request to our executive office 405 Park Avenue 15 th Floor, New York, NY 10022, attention Chief Financial Officer.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P5_S0	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, this annual report on Form 10-K has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P6_S0	American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P7_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. (a Maryland Corporation) (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P7_S1	Our audits of the basic financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a).

1474464_11_ITEM15_P8_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P8_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P8_S2	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P8_S3	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P8_S4	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) to December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. (the Company ), incorporated on October 6, 2009, is a newly formed Maryland corporation that intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	On September 2, 2010, the Company commenced its initial public offering (the IPO ) on a best efforts basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock (exclusive of 25.0 million shares available pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP )) at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-163069) (the Registration Statement ) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	The Company sold 20,000 shares to New York Recovery Special Limited Partnership, LLC, an entity wholly owned by American Realty Capital III, LLC (the Sponsor ) on October 16, 2009, at $10.00 per share.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had 327,499 shares outstanding with an aggregate value of approximately $3.2 million based on a per share value of $10.00.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P20_S1	In addition, the Company sold approximately 2.0 million shares of convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares ) for gross proceeds of approximately $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act (the Preferred Offering ).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	The Company was formed to acquire high quality, income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by the Company alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P21_S2	The Company may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC (the Advisor ), is the Company s affiliated advisor.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Substantially all of the Company s business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the OP ), a Delaware limited partnership.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	The Company is the sole general partner and holder of 99.9% of the units of the OP.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P23_S2	Our Advisor made a capital contribution to the OP in the amount of $2,000 in exchange for 200 OP units, which may be exchanged for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at the Company s option, a corresponding number of shares of common stock.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P23_S3	The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company is managed by the Advisor and New York Recovery Properties, LLC, an entity wholly owned by the Sponsor, which serves as the Company s property manager (the Property Manager ) unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Sponsor, serves as the dealer manager of the Company s IPO.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	These related parties receive compensation and fees for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of the Company s assets.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P24_S3	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages (see Note 10 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	All inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	In determining whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P28_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, and derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, as applicable.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P31_S0	The Company records acquired real estate at cost and makes assessments as to the useful lives of depreciable assets.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Company considers the period of future benefit of the asset to determine the appropriate useful lives.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P31_S2	Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 40 years for buildings, seven to 15 years for building fixtures and improvements and the remaining lease term for acquired intangible lease assets.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold are presented as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented, and properties intended to be sold are designated as held for sale on the balance sheet.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P33_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	Tangible assets include land, buildings, equipment and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P35_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P35_S4	Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	Amounts allocated to land, buildings, equipment and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third-parties or the Company s analysis of comparable properties in its portfolio.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of forty years for buildings, seven years for building equipment and fixtures, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P37_S1	Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P37_S2	In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P37_S3	Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	The aggregate value of intangibles assets related to customer relationship is measured based on the Company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and its overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P41_S1	Characteristics considered in determining these values include the nature and extent of the existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from 2 to 20 years.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P42_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P42_S2	If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P43_S2	The allocations presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are substantially complete; however, there are certain items that will be finalized once additional information is received.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P43_S3	Accordingly, these allocations are subject to revision when final information is available, although the Company does not expect future revisions to have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Intangible assets and acquired lease obligations consist of the following (amounts in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	The following table provides the weighted-average amortization and accretion periods as of December 31, 2010 for intangible assets and liabilities and the projected amortization expense for the next five years (dollar amounts in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	Cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company deposits cash with high quality financial institutions.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	These deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company ( FDIC ) up to an insurance limit.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P48_S2	At December 31, 2010 the company had deposits of $0.3 million of which $0.1 million were in excess of the amount insured by the FDIC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P48_S3	Although the Company bears risk to amounts in excess of those insured by the FDIC, it does not anticipate any losses as a result.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves related to lease expirations as well as maintenance, structural, and debt service reserves as of December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P50_S3	Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	The Company s board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program ( SRP ) that enables stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in limited circumstances.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	The SRP permits investors to sell their shares back to the Company after they have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described below.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	Prior to the time that the Company s shares are listed on a national securities exchange and until the Company establishes an estimated value for the shares, the purchase price per share will depend on the length of time investors have held such shares as follows: after one year from the purchase date the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after two years from the purchase date the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after three years from the purchase date the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; and after four years from the purchase date the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the amount they actually paid for each share (in each case, as adjusted for any stock distributions, combinations, splits and recapitalizations).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company expects to begin establishing an estimated value for its shares based on the value of its real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of its offering.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	Beginning 18 months after the completion of the last offering of the Company s shares (excluding offerings under the DRIP), the board of directors will determine the value of the properties and the other assets based on such information as the board determines appropriate, which may or may not include independent valuations of properties or of the Company as a whole.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company is only authorized to repurchase shares using the proceeds received from the distribution reinvestment plan and will limit the amount spent to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the amount of proceeds received from the distribution reinvestment plan in that same quarter.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	In addition, the board of directors may reject a request for redemption, at any time.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P54_S2	Due to these limitations, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P54_S3	Purchases under the SRP by the Company will be limited in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior year.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	Shares available for redemption based on the limit of 5% of weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the prior year are reported as redeemable common stock, which is a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P55_S1	These amounts are valued at their respective redemption value of the common stock based on the weighted average length of time the stock has been outstanding and available for redemption.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	When a stockholder requests redemption and the redemption is approved by the Company, it will reclassify such obligation from equity to a liability based on the settlement value of the obligation.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, no shares were eligible to be redeemed as the one-year holding requirement had not yet been met.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP ), in which eligible stockholders may elect to reinvest distributions by purchasing shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	No dealer manager fees or selling commissions are paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	Participants purchasing shares pursuant to the DRIP have the same rights and are treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the IPO.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	The board of directors may designate that certain cash or other distributions be excluded from the DRIP.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company has the right to amend any aspect of the DRIP or terminate the DRIP with ten days notice to participants.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P59_S2	Shares issued under the DRIP are recorded to equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the period distributions are declared.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P59_S3	There were no shares issued under the DRIP during the year ended December 31, 2010 or the period from October 6, 2009 to December 31, 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company s operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P63_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P63_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P63_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P64_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P66_S0	The accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P66_S1	If the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P66_S2	If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P66_S3	Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company did not have any derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P68_S0	Upon the acquisition of real estate, certain properties will have leases where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company will record rental revenue for the full term of each lease on a straight-line basis.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P68_S2	When the Company acquires a property, the term of existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P68_S3	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in tenant reimbursement income in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company s revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P69_S1	Since many of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P69_S2	The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P70_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P71_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in the consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P72_S0	Organization and offering costs (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) of the Company may be paid by the Advisor, the Dealer Manager or their affiliates on behalf of the Company.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P72_S1	Such organization and offering costs include all expenses to be paid by the Company in connection with its offering, including but not limited to (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing, and filing fees; (ii) escrow related fees; (iii) reimbursement of the Dealer Manager for amounts it may pay to reimburse the bona fide diligence expenses of broker-dealers; and (iv) reimbursement to the Advisor for the salaries of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and related offering activities.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P72_S2	Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement and the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Company is obligated to reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for organization and offering costs paid by them on behalf of the Company, provided that the Advisor is obligated to reimburse the Company to the extent organization and offering costs (excluding selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and bonafide due diligence cost reimbursements) incurred by the Company in its offering exceed 1.5% of gross offering proceeds.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P72_S3	As a result, these costs are only a liability of the Company to the extent selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs do not exceed 11.5% of the gross proceeds determined at the end of offering (See Note 10 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company has a stock-based incentive award plan for its directors, which is accounted for under the guidance of share based payments.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P73_S1	The guidance on share based compensation also requires the tax benefits associated with these share-based payments to be classified as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P74_S0	The Company made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P74_S1	If the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income to its stockholders, and so long as it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P75_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P75_S1	Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P76_S0	Income (loss) per basic share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P76_S1	Diluted income (loss) per share of common stock considers the effect of potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Company s investments in real estate generate rental revenue and other income through the leasing of properties, which comprised 100% of total consolidated revenues.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P78_S0	Management evaluates the operating performance of the Company s investments in real estate on an individual property level.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P78_S1	The Company s properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P80_S0	In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the guidance on transfers of financial assets to, among other things, eliminate the qualifying special-purpose entity concept, include a new unit of account definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, clarify and change the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, and require significant additional disclosure.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P80_S1	This standard was effective January 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P80_S2	Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P81_S0	In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance which revised the consolidation guidance for variable-interest entities.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P81_S1	The modifications include the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable-interest entity.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P81_S2	This standard was effective January 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P81_S3	Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P82_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies that the stock portion of a distribution to stockholders that allow them to receive cash or stock with a potential limitation on the total amount of cash that all stockholders can elect to receive in the aggregate is considered a share issuance that is reflected in earnings per share prospectively and is not a stock dividend.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P82_S1	This standard was effective January 1, 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P82_S2	Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P83_S0	In January 2010, the FASB amended guidance to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P83_S1	Specifically, the guidance revises two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarifies two others.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P83_S2	It requires separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P83_S3	Also, it requires the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within Level 3 on a gross basis rather than on a net basis.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P83_S4	The amendments clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P83_S5	The adoption of the guidance related to Levels 1 and 2 were effective January 1, 2010 and did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P83_S6	The adoption of the guidance related to Level 3 is effective January 1, 2011 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P84_S0	In February 2010, the FASB updated the guidance to no longer require companies that file with the SEC to indicate the date through which they have analyzed subsequent events.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P84_S1	This updated guidance became effective immediately upon issuance; therefore the Company adopted it as of the first quarter of 2010.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P85_S0	In March 2010, the FASB issued a clarification of previous guidance that exempts certain credit related features from analysis as potential embedded derivatives subject to bifurcation and separate fair value accounting.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P85_S1	This guidance specifies that an embedded credit derivative feature related to the transfer of credit risk that is only in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another is not subject to bifurcation from a host contract.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P85_S2	All other embedded credit derivative features should be analyzed to determine whether their economic characteristics and risks are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and whether bifurcation and separate fair value accounting is required.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P85_S3	The adoption of this guidance on July 1, 2010 had no material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P86_S0	In December 2010, the FASB updated its guidance related to goodwill which affected all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P86_S1	The guidance modifies Step 1 so that for those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P87_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P87_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance, which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P87_S2	This guidance will become effective on January 1, 2011.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P87_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P88_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P89_S0	In December 2010, the FASB updated the guidance related to business combinations to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P89_S1	The amendment specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P89_S2	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P90_S0	The amendment affects any public entity, as defined, that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P90_S1	This guidance will become effective for the Company for acquisitions occurring on or after January 1, 2011.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P90_S2	The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact upon the Company s financial position or results of operations.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P97_S1	This activity is a standard practice that generally occurs following an acquisition.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P97_S2	In connection with this re-measurement, it was determined the property contained approximately 81,000 rentable square feet, or 28% more than the amount represented by the seller of this building.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P98_S0	Non-controlling interest holders contributed $13.0 million to purchase this portfolio.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P102_S0	The following table lists the tenants whose annualized rental revenue represented greater than 10% of consolidated revenues:
1474464_11_ITEM15_P103_S0	No other tenant represents more than 10% of the rental revenue for the periods presented.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P103_S1	In March 2011, the Company re-negotiated the lease terms with Rosselli 61 st Street LLC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P103_S2	The new terms, effective April 2011, include a reduction in monthly rent and an increase in annual rent escalations.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P104_S0	As part of the acquisition of the Interior Design Building (see Note 3 Real Estate Investments) the Company entered into loan agreements totaling $8.9 million with two unaffiliated third party investors.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P104_S1	The loans each have an annual interest rate of 9.0%.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P104_S2	The repayment of such bridge loans require a 1% fee based on the original loan proceeds payable upon the maturities of the respective loans and are pre-payable at any time.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P104_S3	During the fourth quarter of 2010, the terms of the notes were modified from a maturity date of January 1, 2011 to pay interest only on a monthly basis and to repay the remaining principal balance upon maturity on June 30, 2012.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P108_S0	This mortgage is guaranteed by an affiliate, American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., until such time as the Company reaches a net worth of $40.0 million.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P108_S1	Thereafter, this minimum net worth must be maintained by the Company to remain in compliance with the debt covenants under the loan agreement.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P109_S0	The following table summarizes the scheduled aggregate principal repayments for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2010 (amounts in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM15_P110_S0	The Company follows the guidance related to the fair value of financial instruments that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P111_S0	The framework for measuring fair value requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P111_S1	The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P111_S2	This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, and implied volatilities.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P112_S0	The guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
1474464_11_ITEM15_P113_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P114_S0	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P115_S0	Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P116_S0	The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P116_S1	In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P116_S2	The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter; and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P116_S3	However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P117_S0	The Company did not have any assets or liabilities required to be recorded at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P118_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P119_S0	The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P119_S1	The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other receivables, due to affiliates, short-term notes payable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and distributions payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheet due to their short-term nature.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P119_S2	The fair values of the Company s remaining financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet are reported below (amounts in thousands):
1474464_11_ITEM15_P120_S0	The fair value of the mortgage notes payable are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Company's current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P121_S0	In December 2009, the Company commenced its Preferred Offering to qualified investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P121_S1	The Company sold 1,966,376 Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P121_S2	Upon the commencement of the Company s IPO the Preferred Offering was terminated.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P122_S0	The Preferred Shares have a liquidation preference of $9.00 per Preferred Share regardless of the purchase price paid.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P122_S1	From the date of the closing at which an investor is issued Preferred Shares, the Company will pay cumulative dividends on the Preferred Shares monthly in arrears at the annualized rate of 8.00% on the liquidation preference (resulting in a dividend rate of 8.23% of the purchase price if the purchase price is $8.75 and a dividend rate of 8.47% of the purchase price if the purchase price is $8.50).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P123_S0	The Preferred Shares rank senior to all other shares of the Company s capital stock, including its common stock, with respect to dividends and payments and distribution of assets upon liquidation.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P123_S1	The holders of the Preferred Shares may elect to convert them, in whole or in part, into shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time after the one year anniversary of the final closing date of the Preferred Offering (the Final Closing ).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P123_S2	The Preferred Shares are redeemable and the holder may be required to convert the Preferred Shares into common stock under certain circumstances.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Preferred Shares are convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock at any time and from time to time after the first anniversary of the Final Closing, at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis (as adjusted for any stock split, stock combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar transaction).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P125_S0	Redemption or Conversion at the Option of the Company .
1474464_11_ITEM15_P125_S1	At the option of the Company, any time after the one year anniversary of the Final Closing, (i) the Preferred Shares are redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at a redemption price equal to the purchase price paid by a holder plus accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the date of redemption, and/or (ii) the Company can require that the Preferred Shares be converted, in whole or in part, into common stock on a one-for-one basis (and will pay the holder an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the date of conversion on the Preferred Shares converted).
1474464_11_ITEM15_P126_S0	If the Company calls the Preferred Shares for redemption for cash and the Company s Registration Statement is effective, the holders will have the option to convert the Preferred Shares into common stock at any time prior to the redemption date.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P127_S0	On the third anniversary of the date of the Final Closing, the Company, at its option, either shall redeem all the Preferred Shares for cash or convert all the Preferred Shares into shares of common stock at the redemption price or conversion price set forth in the paragraph above entitled Redemption or Conversion at the Option of the Company.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P128_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_11_ITEM15_P129_S0	Because the terms of the Preferred Shares allow the Company to either convert the shares to common stock at a fixed rate or redeem the shares for cash, also at a fixed amount, and the holder of the Preferred Shares only has the right to convert the Preferred Shares to common stock at a fixed redemption rate and does not, except in the case of death or disability of the holder, have the right to redeem the stock for cash, the Preferred Shares are included as a separate component of equity in the Company s balance sheet.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P511_S0	(c) no payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than the correct fixed rent or additional rent due hereunder shall be deemed to be other than a payment on account, nor shall any endorsement or statement on any check or any letter accompanying any check or payment be deemed an accord and satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check or payment without prejudice to Landlord s right to recover the balance or pursue any other remedy in this lease or at law provided.

1474464_11_ITEM15_P1023_S0	Dated this 28th day of March, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation, and qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	On September 2, 2010, we commenced our IPO on a reasonable best efforts basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-163069) (the Registration Statement ) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our Registration Statement also covers up to 25.0 million shares available pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP ) under which our common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at the greater of $9.50 per share or 95% of the estimated value of a share of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , we had 6.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted shares of convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares ) and shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2011 , we had received total gross proceeds of $45.8 million from the sale of 4.6 million shares of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S5	In addition, we sold 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, which terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the Registration Statement.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S6	On December 15, 2011, we exercised our option to convert the Preferred Shares into 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2011 , the aggregate value of all common share issuances and subscriptions outstanding was $66.4 million based on a per share value of $10.00 (or $9.50 for shares issued under the DRIP).
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	We were formed to acquire high quality, income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	We purchased our first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2011 we owned nine properties consisting of 148,933 rentable square feet, which were 91.0% occupied on a weighted-average basis with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.7 years.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S5	Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "OP').
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S6	We are the sole general partner and holder of 99.01% of the units of the OP.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S7	Our Advisor is the sole limited partner and owner of a 0.99% non-controlling interest in our OP.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S8	The limited partner interests may be exchanged for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at our option, a corresponding number of shares of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S9	The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S10	We retained the Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S11	Our Property Manager, an entity wholly owned by American Realty Capital III, LLC (the Sponsor ), serves as our property manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S12	Our Dealer Manager, an affiliate of the Sponsor, serves as the dealer manager of our IPO.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S13	These related parties receive compensation and fees for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P1_S14	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Real estate-related investments are higher-yield and higher-risk investments that our Advisor will actively manage, if we elect to acquire such investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	The real estate-related investments in which we may invest include: (i) mortgage loans; (ii) equity securities such as common stock, preferred stock and convertible preferred securities of real estate companies; (iii) debt securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgages, mortgage loan participations and debt securities issued by other real estate companies; and (iv) certain types of illiquid investments, such as mezzanine loans and bridge loans.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	Since our inception, we have not acquired any real estate-related investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Investment Objectives We are focused on helping our stockholders take advantage of a unique window of opportunity to participate in the expected recovery of the New York City real estate market.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our investment goals are as follows:
1474464_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Maximize Total Returns Maximize total returns to our stockholders through a combination of realized appreciation and current income.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Focus We intend to focus our investment activities on acquiring quality income-producing commercial real estate located in the New York MSA and, in particular, properties located in New York City and originating or acquiring real estate debt backed by quality income-producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	The real estate debt we originate or acquire is expected to be primarily first mortgage debt but also may include bridge loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity or securitized loans.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Investing in Real Property We expect to invest in commercial real estate including various property types such as office, retail, multi-family residential, industrial and hotel.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	We may invest in commercial real estate located anywhere in the continental United States, but plan to focus on commercial real estate located in New York City.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	Our policies require that a minimum of 70% of our assets be located in the New York MSA (calculated after the close of our offering and once substantially all the proceeds of our offering have been invested).
1474464_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	When evaluating prospective investments in real property, our management and our Advisor will consider relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	In this regard, our Advisor will have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject to board approval.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The following table lists the tenants whose annualized rental income on a straight-line basis represented greater than 10% of our total annualized rental income for all portfolio properties on a straight-line basis:
1474464_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	________________________________ * Tenant's annualized rental income on a straight-line basis was not greater than 10% of our total annualized rental income for all portfolio properties as of the period specified.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of one of the above tenants would have a material adverse effect on revenues.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	No other tenant represents more than 10% of our annualized rental income for the periods presented.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	We may originate or acquire real estate loans.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	Although we do not have a formal policy, our criteria for investing in loans will be substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	We may originate or invest in real estate loans (including, but not limited to, investments in first, second and third mortgage loans, wraparound mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans on real property, and loans on leasehold interest mortgages).
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	We also may invest in participations in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	Further, we may invest in unsecured loans; however, we will n ot make unsecured loans or loans not secured by mortgages unless such loans are approved by a majority of our independent directors.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S5	We currently do not intend to invest in or originate real estate loans (excluding publicly traded real estate debt) in excess of 20% of the aggregate value of our assets as of the close of our IPO and thereafter.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S6	To the extent that we invest in collateralized mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), we intend to invest in CMBS guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, such as the Government National Mortgage Association, or U.S. government sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, to reduce the credit and interest rate risk.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S7	We will not make or invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans outstanding on the property, including our borrowings, would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of the property, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, unless substantial justification exists, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S8	Our board of directors may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans in cases in which we believe there is a high probability of our foreclosure upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and, in respect of transactions with our affiliates, in which the cost of the mortgage loan investment does not exceed the appraised value of the underlying property.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P9_S9	Our board of directors may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans that are in default where we intend to foreclose upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and, in respect of transactions with our affiliates, where the cost of the mortgage loan investment does not exceed the appraised value of the underlying property.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our Advisor will evaluate all potential loan investments to determine if the term of the loan, the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meets our investment criteria and objectives.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	An officer, director, agent or employee of our Advisor will inspect the property securing the loan, if any, during the loan approval process.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	We do not expect to make or invest in mortgage or mezzanine loans with a maturity of more than ten years from the date of our investment, and anticipate that most loans will have a term of five years.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	We do not expect to make or invest in bridge loans with a maturity of more than one year (with the right to extend the term for an additional one year) from the date of our investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Most loans which we will consider for investment would provide for monthly payments of interest and some also may provide for principal amortization, although many loans of the nature which we will consider provide for payments of interest only and a payment of principal in full at the end of the loan term.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	We will not originate loans with negative amortization provisions.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Our charter does not limit the amount of gross offering proceeds that we may apply to loan originations or investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our charter also does not place any limit or restriction on: the percentage of our assets that may be invested in any type or any single loan; or the types of properties subject to the mortgages or other loans in which we invest.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Investing in Real Estate Securities We may invest in securities of non-majority-owned publicly traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	We may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or options to acquire such securities.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P13_S2	It is our intention that we be limited to investing no more than 20% of the aggregate value of our assets as of the close of our initial ongoing offering and thereafter in publicly traded real estate equity or debt securities, including, but not limited to, CMBS.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P13_S3	However, any investment in equity securities (including any preferred equity securities) that are not traded on a national securities exchange or included for quotation on an inter-dealer quotation system must be approved by a majority of directors, including a majority of independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair, competitive and commercially reasonable.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	We anticipate acquiring fee interests in properties (a fee interest is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although other methods of acquiring a property, including acquiring leasehold interests (a leasehold interest is a right to enjoy the possession and use of an asset or property for a stated definite period as created by a written lease), may be utilized if we deem it to be advantageous.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	For example, we may acquire properties through a joint venture or the acquisition of substantially all of the interests of an entity which in turn owns the real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	We also may make preferred equity investments in an entity that owns real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our focus will be on acquiring office and retail properties but we also may acquire multifamily, industrial, hotel and other types of real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	Financing Strategies and Policies Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at a later time.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or at a fixed rate or floating rate.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	Under our charter, the maximum amount of our total indebtedness shall not exceed 300% of our total net assets (as defined by the North American Securities Administrators Association ("NASAA") REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	In addition, it is currently our intention to limit our aggregate borrowings to 40% to 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets (calculated after the close of our initial ongoing offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our offering), unless borrowing a greater amount is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for borrowing such a greater amount.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S4	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S5	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S6	We will not borrow from our Advisor or its affiliates unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approves the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S7	Except with respect to the borrowing limits contained in our charter, we may reevaluate and change our financing policies without a stockholder vote.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P17_S8	Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include: then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, our expected investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Tax Status We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, and so long as we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	We believe we are organized and operating in such a manner as to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Competition The retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential real estate markets are highly competitive.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	We compete with other owners and operators of retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	The continued development of new retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in the New York MSA.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	The number of competing properties in the New York MSA could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S5	In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S6	These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S7	There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others may be organized in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S8	Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S9	In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S10	Therefore, we compete for financing in a market where funds for real estate financing may decrease.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S11	Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S12	It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S13	In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of proceeds from our offering in desirable assets, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability to commence or maintain distributions to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S14	We believe that our senior management s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry will enable us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S15	Because we are organized as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, we are well positioned within the industries in which we intend to operate to offer existing owners the opportunity to contribute their properties to our company in tax-deferred transactions using our operating partnership units as transactional currency.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S16	As a result, we have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S17	Regulations Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S18	We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S19	As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S20	Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P20_S21	However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	Employees We have no direct employees.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	The employees of the Advisor and other affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, wholesale brokerage and investor relations services.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including the sale of shares of our common stock, asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Financial Information About Industry Segments Our current business consists of owning, managing, operating, leasing, acquiring, investing in and disposing of real estate assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	All of our consolidated revenues are from our consolidated real estate properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view all of our real estate assets as one industry segment, and, accordingly, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	Please see Part IV, Item 15 Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, included elsewhere in this annual report for more detailed financial information.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	We electronically file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, and proxy statements, with the SEC.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	We also filed with the SEC our Registration Statement in connection with our current offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, or you may obtain information by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	The SEC maintains an internet address at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and information statements, and other information, which you may obtain free of charge.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P25_S4	In addition, copies of our filings with the SEC may be obtained from the website maintained for us and our affiliates at www.americanrealtycap.com .
1474464_12_ITEM1_P25_S5	Access to these filings is free of charge.
1474464_12_ITEM1_P25_S6	We are not incorporating our website or any information from the website into this Form 10-K.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We have a limited operating history and have no established financing sources, and the prior performance of other real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor may not be an indication of our future results.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We have a limited operating history and you should not rely upon the past performance of other real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor to predict our future results.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	We were incorporated on October 6, 2009.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , we have acquired only nine properties and do not otherwise have any operations or independent financing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The recent real estate experience of Messrs. Schorsch, Kahane and Happel principally has focused on triple-net leasing rather than the ownership and operation of real estate properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Accordingly, the prior performance of real estate investment programs sponsored by affiliates of Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane and our Advisor may not be indicative of our future results.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Moreover, neither our Advisor nor we have any established financing sources other than the proceeds of our offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Presently, both we and our Advisor have been funded by capital contributions or advances from American Realty Capital III, LLC, a company which is directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. Schorsch and Mr. Kahane, by proceeds from our offering and by loans from unaffiliated entities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	If our capital resources, or those of our Advisor, are insufficient to support our operations, we will not be successful.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P1_S5	You should consider our prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are, like us, in their early stage of development.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P1_S6	To be successful in this market, we must, among other things:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	continue to build and expand our operations structure to support our business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will succeed in achieving these goals, and our failure to do so could cause you to lose all or a portion of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Because our initial ongoing offering is a blind pool offering, you will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments before we make them, which makes an investment in us more speculative.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We have acquired nine properties and have not identified any other properties to acquire.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Additionally, we will not provide you with information to evaluate our investments prior to our acquisition of properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We will seek to invest substantially all the offering proceeds available for investment, after the payment of fees and expenses, in the acquisition of properties located in the New York MSA, and, in particular, New York City, or otherwise only in the United States.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We also may, in the discretion of our Advisor, invest in other types of real estate or in entities that invest in real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	In addition, our Advisor may make or invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or participations therein on our behalf if our board of directors determines, due to the state of the real estate market or in order to diversify our investment portfolio or otherwise, that such investments are advantageous to us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	You may be more likely to sustain a loss on your investment because our Sponsor does not have as strong an economic incentive to avoid losses as does a sponsor who has made significant equity investments in its company.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Our Sponsor has only invested $200,000 in us through the purchase of 20,000 shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Therefore, since we were successful in raising enough proceeds to be able to reimburse our Sponsor for our significant organization and offering expenses, our Sponsor will have little exposure to loss in the value of our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P4_S8	Without this exposure, our investors may be at a greater risk of loss because our Sponsor may have less to lose from a decrease in the value of our shares than would a sponsor that makes more significant equity investments in its company.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	There is no public trading market for our shares and there may never be one; therefore, it will be difficult for you to sell your shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	There currently is no public market for our shares and there may never be one.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If you are able to find a buyer for your shares, you may not sell your shares unless the buyer meets applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards and the sale does not violate state securities laws.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our charter also prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock by a single investor, unless exempted by our board of directors, which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase your shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Moreover, our share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that would limit your ability to sell your shares to us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our board of directors may reject any request for redemption of shares, or amend, suspend or terminate our share repurchase program upon 30 days notice.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Therefore, it will be difficult for you to sell your shares promptly or at all.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S7	If you are able to sell your shares, you likely will have to sell them at a substantial discount to the price you paid for the shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S8	It also is likely that your shares would not be accepted as the primary collateral for a loan.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S9	You should purchase the shares only as a long-term investment because of the illiquid nature of the shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S10	If we, through our Advisor, are unable to find suitable investments, then we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S11	Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions is dependent upon the performance of our Advisor in acquiring our investments, selecting tenants for our properties and securing independent financing arrangements.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S12	As of December 31, 2011 , we own only nine properties and we have not identified any other properties to acquire and do not have any other investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S13	Except for those investments described herein and those investors who purchase shares in our offering after such time as our prospectus is supplemented to describe one or more additional investments which have been identified, you will have no opportunity to evaluate the terms of transactions or other economic or financial data concerning our investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S14	You must rely entirely on the management ability of our Advisor and the oversight of our board of directors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P5_S15	We cannot be sure that our Advisor will be successful in obtaining suitable investments on financially attractive terms or that, if it makes investments on our behalf, our objectives will be achieved.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We could suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, particularly as a result of our reliance on our Advisor at times when management of our Advisor is simultaneously seeking to locate suitable investments for other affiliated programs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Delays we encounter in the selection and acquisition of income-producing properties (and, if we develop properties, development of income-producing properties) likely would adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your overall returns.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In such event, we may pay all or a substantial portion of our distributions from the proceeds of our offering or from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow, which may constitute a return of your capital.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from our offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Distributions from the proceeds of our offering or from borrowings also could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	This, in turn, would reduce the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	In particular, where we acquire properties prior to the start of construction or during the early stages of construction, it typically will take several months to complete construction and rent available space.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Therefore, you could suffer delays in the receipt of cash distributions attributable to those particular properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S9	If our Advisor is unable to obtain further suitable investments, we will hold the uninvested proceeds of our offering in an interest-bearing account or invest the proceeds in short-term, investment-grade investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P6_S10	If we cannot invest the uninvested proceeds from our offering within a reasonable amount of time, or if our board of directors determines it is in the best interests of our stockholders, we will return the uninvested proceeds to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our properties may be adversely affected by the current economic downturn, as well as economic cycles and risks inherent to the New York MSA, especially New York City.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expect to use substantially all the net proceeds of our offering to acquire quality income-producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City and elsewhere in the New York MSA.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the New York MSA, including a continuation or worsening of the current economic downturn, would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact the New York MSA in both the short and long term.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in the New York MSA could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P7_S5	The factors affecting economic conditions in the New York MSA include:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In addition, since rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions, our office properties located in the New York MSA may be adversely affected during periods of diminished economic growth and a decline in white-collar employment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for over two years.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	A protracted economic downturn could have a negative impact on our portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If real property or other real estate related asset values continue to decline after we acquire them, we may have a difficult time making new acquisitions or generating returns on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If the current debt market environment persists, we may modify our investment strategy in order to optimize our portfolio performance.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our options would include limiting or eliminating the use of debt and focusing on those investments that do not require the use of leverage to meet our portfolio goals.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	It is impossible for us to assess with certainty the future effects of the current adverse trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic area in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in this area.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If the current economic downturn persists or if there is any further local, national or global worsening of the current economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability will be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Because our properties will be located primarily in New York City, our portfolio may be concentrated in properties of substantial size.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We anticipate having significant investments in the New York MSA, primarily in New York City, where individual property values may be substantially higher than in other geographic areas in the United States or abroad.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may acquire one or more individual properties with high acquisition costs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result, our portfolio may be concentrated in few properties of substantial size.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the New York MSA would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We anticipate having significant investments in the New York MSA, primarily in New York City.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S8	This in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S9	As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S10	If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number and type of investments we may make and the value of your investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific properties we acquire.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Our offering is being made on a best efforts basis, whereby the Dealer Manager is only required to use its best efforts to sell our shares and has no firm commitment or obligation to purchase any of the shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S12	As a result, the amount of proceeds we raise in our offering may be substantially less than the amount we would need to achieve a broadly diversified property portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S13	If we are unable to raise substantially more than the minimum offering amount, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the number of investments owned, the geographic regions in which our investments are located and the types of investments that we make.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S14	In such event, the likelihood of our profitability being affected by the performance of any one of our investments will increase.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S15	Additionally, we are not limited in the number or size of our investments or the percentage of net proceeds we may dedicate to a single investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S16	Your investment in our shares will be subject to greater risk to the extent that we lack a diversified portfolio of investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S17	In addition, our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, and our financial condition and ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S18	If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain key personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S19	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain of our executive officers and other key personnel of our Advisor, including Nicholas S. Schorsch and William M. Kahane, each of whom would be difficult to replace.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S20	Our Advisor does not have an employment agreement with any of these key personnel and we cannot guarantee that all, or any particular one, will remain affiliated with us and/or our Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S21	If any of our key personnel were to cease their affiliation with our Advisor, our operating results could suffer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S22	Further, we do not intend to separately maintain key person life insurance on Messrs. Schorsch or Kahane or any other person.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S23	We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our Advisor s ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial, operational and marketing personnel.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S24	Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that our Advisor will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P11_S25	If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain the services of key personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered, and the value of your investment may decline.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be unable to pay or maintain distributions from cash available from operations or increase distributions over time.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	There are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash distributions to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The amount of cash available for distributions is affected by many factors, such as our ability to buy properties as offering proceeds become available, rental income from such properties and our operating expense levels, as well as many other variables.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Actual cash available for distributions may vary substantially from estimates.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	With no prior operating history, we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay or maintain our current level of distributions or that distributions will increase over time.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We cannot give any assurance that rents from the properties will increase, that the securities we buy will increase in value or provide constant or increased distributions over time, or that future acquisitions of real properties, mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or any investments in securities will increase our cash available for distributions to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Our actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used by our board of directors in establishing the distribution rate to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We may not have sufficient cash from operations to make a distribution required to qualify for or maintain our REIT status.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We may pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S8	For example, we may borrow money or use proceeds from our offering to make distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Any such distributions will constitute a return of capital and may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties and negatively impact the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S10	In addition, we may issue additional securities or sell assets to fund distribution payments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers, directors and our Advisor are limited, which could reduce your and our recovery against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S12	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S13	In addition, subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors, officers and Advisor and our Advisor s affiliates and permits us to indemnify our employees and agents.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S14	However, as required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines, our charter provides that we may not indemnify a director, our Advisor or an affiliate of our Advisor for any loss or liability suffered by any of them or hold harmless such indemnitee for any loss or liability suffered by us unless; (1) the indemnitee determined, in good faith, that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in our best interests, (2) the indemnitee was acting on behalf of or performing services for us, (3) the liability or loss was not the result of (A) negligence or misconduct, in the case of a director (other than an independent director), the Advisor or an affiliate of the Advisor, or (B) gross negligence or willful misconduct, in the case of an independent director, and (4) the indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of our net assets and not from our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S15	Although our charter does not allow us to indemnify or hold harmless an indemnitee to a greater extent than permitted under Maryland law and the NASAA REIT Guidelines, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors, officers, employees and agents, and our Advisor and its affiliates, than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce your and our recovery against them.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P13_S16	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents or our Advisor and its affiliates in some cases which would decrease the cash otherwise available for distribution to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest We will be subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationships with our Advisor and its affiliates, including the material conflicts discussed below.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The management of multiple REITs, especially REITs in the development stage, by our executive officers and officers of our Advisor may significantly reduce the amount of time our executive officers and officers of our Advisor are able to spend on activities related to us and may cause other conflicts of interest, which may cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our executive officers and officers of our Advisor are part of the senior management or are key personnel of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs and their advisors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs, including us, Phillips Edison ARC Shopping Center REIT, Inc., or PE-ARC, American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust, Inc., or ARC HT, American Realty Capital Retail Centers of America, Inc., or ARC RCA, American Realty Capital Daily Net Asset Value Trust, Inc., or ARC Daily NAV, American Realty Capital Trust III, Inc., or ARCT III have effective registration statements and currently are offering securities in the aggregate of approximately $9.0 billion.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	American Realty Capital Global Daily Net Asset Value Trust, Inc., or ARC Global DNAV, has a registration statement that is not yet effective and is in the development phase.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., or ARCT, completed its public offering of common stock in December 2011 for gross proceeds of approximately $1.7 billion.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	American Realty Capital Properties, Inc., or ARCP, which currently trades on NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol ARCP, completed its initial public offering of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $69.8 million.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S4	As a result, such REITs will have concurrent or overlapping fundraising, acquisition, operational and disposition and liquidation phases as us, which may cause conflicts of interest to arise throughout the life of our company with respect to, among other things, finding investors, locating and acquiring properties, entering into leases and disposing of properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Additionally, based on our Sponsor s experience, a significantly greater time commitment is required of senior management during the development stage when the REIT is being organized, funds are initially being raised and funds are initially being invested, and less time is required as additional funds are raised and the offering matures.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S6	The conflicts of interest each of our executive officers and each officer of our Advisor will face may delay our fund raising and investment of our proceeds due to the competing time demands and generally cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Officers of any service provider may face similar conflicts of interest should they be involved with the management of multiple REITs, and especially REITs in the developmental stage.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We will compete for investors with other programs of our Sponsor, which could adversely affect the amount of capital we have to invest.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The American Realty Capital group of companies is currently the sponsor of seven other public offerings of non-traded REIT shares and a public offering of shares for a REIT that has been approved for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the majority of which offerings will be ongoing during a significant portion of our offering period.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These programs all have filed registration statements for the offering of common stock and either are or intend to elect to be taxed as REITs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Except for ARCT, whose offering was fully subscribed as of July 5, 2011, the offerings are taking place concurrently with our offering, and our Sponsor is likely to sponsor other offerings during our offering period.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Our Dealer Manager is the dealer manager for these other offerings.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We will compete for investors with these other programs, and the overlap of these offerings with our offering could adversely affect our ability to raise all the capital we seek in our offering, the timing of sales of our shares and the amount of proceeds we have to spend on real estate investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our Advisor will face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase and leasing of properties, and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect our investment opportunities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Affiliates of our Advisor have sponsored and may sponsor one or more other real estate investment programs in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may buy properties at the same time as one or more of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs managed by officers and key personnel of our Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	There is a risk that our Advisor will choose a property that provides lower returns to us than a property purchased by another American Realty Capital-sponsored program.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We cannot be sure that officers and key personnel acting on behalf of our Advisor and on behalf of managers of other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs will act in our best interests when deciding whether to allocate any particular property to us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In addition, we may acquire properties in geographic areas where other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs own properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Also, we may acquire properties from, or sell properties to, other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If one of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs attracts a tenant that we are competing for, we could suffer a loss of revenue due to delays in locating another suitable tenant.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S7	You will not have the opportunity to evaluate the manner in which these conflicts of interest are resolved before or after making your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Similar conflicts of interest may apply if our Advisor determines to make or purchase mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or participations therein on our behalf, since other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs may be competing with us for these investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our Advisor faces conflicts of interest relating to joint ventures, which could result in a disproportionate benefit to the other venture partners at our expense.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We have entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliated entity, American Realty Capital Operating Partnership, L.P., and may enter into joint ventures with other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our Advisor may have conflicts of interest in determining which American Realty Capital-sponsored program should enter into any particular joint venture agreement.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In addition, our Advisor may face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interest of the affiliated co-venturer and in managing the joint venture.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Since our Advisor and its affiliates will control both the affiliated co-venturer and, to a certain extent, us, agreements and transactions between the co-venturers with respect to any such joint venture will not have the benefit of arm s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers, which may result in the co-venturer receiving benefits greater than the benefits that we receive.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S6	In addition, we may assume liabilities related to the joint venture that exceeds the percentage of our investment in the joint venture.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Our Advisor and its officers and employees and certain of our key personnel face competing demands relating to their time, and this may cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our Advisor and its officers and employees and certain of our key personnel and their respective affiliates are key personnel, general partners and sponsors of other real estate programs having investment objectives and legal and financial obligations similar to ours and may have other business interests as well.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Because these persons have competing demands on their time and resources, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our business and these other activities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If this occurs, the returns on our investments may suffer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Our officers and directors face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with affiliated entities, which could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to generate returns to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Certain of our executive officers, including Nicholas S. Schorsch, who also serves as the chairman of our board of directors, and William M. Kahane, our president, also are officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager, our Dealer Manager and other affiliated entities, including other REITs sponsored by the American Realty Capital group of companies, and their respective advisors and property managers.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	As a result, these individuals owe fiduciary duties to these other entities and their stockholders and limited partners, which fiduciary duties may conflict with the duties that they owe to us and our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Their loyalties to these other entities could result in actions or inactions that are detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our investment and leasing opportunities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S7	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of new investments and management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) our purchase of properties from, or sale of properties, to affiliated entities, (c) the timing and terms of the investment in or sale of an asset, (d) development of our properties by affiliates, (e) investments with affiliates of our Advisor, (f) compensation to our Advisor, and (g) our relationship with our Dealer Manager and Property Manager.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S8	If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, we may be unable to generate cash needed to make distributions to you and to maintain or increase the value of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P20_S9	If these individuals act in a manner that is detrimental to our business or favor one entity over another, they may be subject to liability for breach of fiduciary duty.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our Advisor faces conflicts of interest relating to the incentive fee structure under our advisory agreement, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Under our advisory agreement, our Advisor or its affiliates will be entitled to fees that are structured in a manner intended to provide incentives to our Advisor to perform in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	However, because our Advisor does not maintain a significant equity interest in us and is entitled to receive substantial minimum compensation regardless of performance, our Advisor s interests are not wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In that regard, our Advisor could be motivated to recommend riskier or more speculative investments in order for us to generate the specified levels of performance or sales proceeds that would entitle our Advisor to fees.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, our Advisor s or its affiliates entitlement to fees upon the sale of our assets and to participate in sale proceeds could result in our Advisor recommending sales of our investments at the earliest possible time at which sales of investments would produce the level of return that would entitle the Advisor to compensation relating to such sales, even if continued ownership of those investments might be in our best long-term interest.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our advisory agreement will require us to pay a performance-based termination fee to our Advisor or its affiliates if we terminate the advisory agreement prior to the listing of our shares for trading on an exchange or, absent such listing, in respect of its participation in net sales proceeds.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	To avoid paying this fee, our independent directors may decide against terminating the advisory agreement prior to our listing of our shares or disposition of our investments even if, but for the termination fee, termination of the advisory agreement would be in our best interest.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In addition, the requirement to pay the fee to the Advisor or its affiliates at termination could cause us to make different investment or disposition decisions than we would otherwise make, in order to satisfy our obligation to pay the fee to the terminated Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Moreover, our Advisor will have the right to terminate the advisory agreement upon a change of control of our company and thereby trigger the payment of the performance fee, which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing the change of control.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	There is no separate counsel for us and our affiliates, which could result in conflicts of interest.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Proskauer Rose LLP acts as legal counsel to us and also represents our Advisor and some of its affiliates.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	There is a possibility in the future that the interests of the various parties may become adverse and, under the Code of Professional Responsibility of the legal profession, Proskauer Rose LLP may be precluded from representing any one or all such parties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If any situation arises in which our interests appear to be in conflict with those of our Advisor or its affiliates, additional counsel may be retained by one or more of the parties to assure that their interests are adequately protected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Moreover, should a conflict of interest not be readily apparent, Proskauer Rose LLP may inadvertently act in derogation of the interest of the parties which could affect our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P22_S5	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Our charter permits our board of directors to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of common stockholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Our charter permits our board of directors to issue up to 350.0 million shares of stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, our board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series of stock that we have authority to issue.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have a priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may limit your ability to exit the investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Under Maryland law, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has exempted any business combination involving our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	As a result, our Advisor and any affiliate of our Advisor may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by stockholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	A control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or by-laws of the corporation.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Our by-laws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P34_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	The company is not registered, and does not intend to register itself or any of its subsidiaries, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we become obligated to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company, the registered entity would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act imposing, among other things:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The company intends to conduct its operations, directly and through wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, so that the company and each of its subsidiaries are exempt from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an investment company if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Since we will be primarily engaged in the business of acquiring real estate, we believe that the company and most, if not all, of its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries will not be considered investment companies under either Section 3(a)(1)(A) or Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If the company or any of its wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries would ever inadvertently fall within one of the definitions of investment company, we intend to rely on the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Under Section 3(c)(5)(C), the SEC staff generally requires the company to maintain at least 55% of its assets directly in qualifying assets and at least 80% of the entity s assets in qualifying assets and in a broader category of real estate related assets to qualify for this exception.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Mortgage-related securities may or may not constitute such qualifying assets, depending on the characteristics of the mortgage-related securities, including the rights that we have with respect to the underlying loans.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The company s ownership of mortgage-related securities, therefore, is limited by provisions of the Investment Company Act and SEC staff interpretations.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The method we use to classify our assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act will be based in large measure upon no-action positions taken by the SEC staff in the past.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These no-action positions were issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and a number of these no-action positions were issued more than ten years ago.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	No assurance can be given that the SEC staff will concur with our classification of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	In addition, the SEC staff may, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to re-classify our assets for purposes of qualifying for an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we are required to re-classify our assets, we may no longer be in compliance with the exclusion from the definition of an investment company provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	A change in the value of any of our assets could cause us or one or more of our wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries to fall within the definition of investment company and negatively affect our ability to maintain our exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	To avoid being required to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S5	In addition, we may have to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or may have to forgo opportunities to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire and would be important to our investment strategy.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S6	If we were required to register the company as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P41_S7	In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	You are bound by the majority vote on matters on which you are entitled to vote, and therefore, your vote on a particular matter may be superseded by the vote of others.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	You may vote on certain matters at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, including the election of directors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	However, you will be bound by the majority vote on matters requiring approval of a majority of the stockholders even if you do not vote with the majority on any such matter.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If you do not agree with the decisions of our board of directors, you only have limited control over changes in our policies and operations and may not be able to change such policies and operations.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Our board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding investments, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders except to the extent that such policies are set forth in our charter.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Under the Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter, our stockholders have a right to vote only on the following:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	certain mergers, consolidations or sales or other dispositions of all or substantially all our assets, as provided in our charter.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	All other matters are subject to the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our board of directors may change our investment policies without stockholder approval, which could alter the nature of your investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These policies may change over time.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The methods of implementing our investment policies also may vary, as new real estate development trends emerge and new investment techniques are developed.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Our investment policies, the methods for their implementation, and our other objectives, policies and procedures may be altered by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S5	As a result, the nature of your investment could change without your consent.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S6	We will not calculate the net asset value per share for our shares until 18 months after completion of our last offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S7	Therefore, you will not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an ongoing basis during our offering and for a substantial period of time thereafter.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P44_S8	We do not intend to calculate the net asset value per share for our shares until 18 months after the completion of our last offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Beginning 18 months after the completion of the last offering of our shares (excluding offerings under our distribution reinvestment plan), our board of directors will determine the value of our properties and our other assets based on such information as our board determines appropriate, which may or may not include independent valuations of our properties or of our enterprise as a whole.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We will disclose this net asset value to stockholders in our filings with the SEC.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Therefore, you will not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an ongoing basis during our offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S3	You are limited in your ability to sell your shares pursuant to our share repurchase program and may have to hold your shares for an indefinite period of time.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Our board of directors may amend the terms of our share repurchase program without stockholder approval.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Our board of directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program upon 30 days notice or to reject any request for repurchase.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S6	In addition, the share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that would limit your ability to sell your shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S7	Generally, you must have held your shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S8	Subject to funds being available, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below until we establish an estimated value of our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S9	We do not currently anticipate obtaining appraisals for our investments (other than investments in transactions with our Sponsor, Advisor, directors or their respective affiliates) and, accordingly, the estimated value of our investments should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S10	We expect to begin establishing an estimated value of our shares based on the value of our real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of our offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P45_S11	We will retain persons independent of us and our Advisor to prepare the estimated value of our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Only those stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions may be able to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In other words, once our shares are transferred for value by a stockholder, the transferee and all subsequent holders of the shares are not eligible to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We will repurchase shares on the last business day of each quarter (and in all events on a date other than a dividend payment date).
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Prior to establishing the estimated value of our shares, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows: (a) the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least one year, (b) the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least two years, (c) the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least three years, and (d) the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least four years (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	These limits might prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any year.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	These restrictions severely limit your ability to sell your shares should you require liquidity, and limit your ability to recover the value you invested or the fair market value of your shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	We established the offering price on an arbitrary basis; as a result, the actual value of your investment may be substantially less than what you pay.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P47_S5	Our board of directors has arbitrarily determined the selling price of the shares, and such price bears no relationship to our book or asset values, or to any other established criteria for valuing issued or outstanding shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P47_S6	Because the offering price is not based upon any independent valuation, the offering price is not indicative of the proceeds that you would receive upon liquidation.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Because our Dealer Manager is one of our affiliates, you will not have the benefit of an independent review of our prospectus or us customarily performed in underwritten offerings.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our Dealer Manager is one of our affiliates and will not make an independent review of us or our offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Accordingly, you will have to rely on your own broker-dealer to make an independent review of the terms of our offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If your broker-dealer does not conduct such a review, you will not have the benefit of an independent review of the terms of our offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Further, the due diligence investigation of us by our Dealer Manager cannot be considered to be an independent review and, therefore, may not be as meaningful as a review conducted by an unaffiliated broker-dealer or investment banker.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S5	In addition, we do not, and do not expect to, have research analysts reviewing our performance or our securities on an ongoing basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Therefore, you will not have an independent review of our performance and the value of our common stock relative to publicly traded companies.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Your interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S8	Existing stockholders and potential investors in our offering do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S9	Our charter currently has authorized 350.0 million shares of stock, of which 300.0 million shares are designated as common stock and 50.0 million are designated as preferred stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S10	Subject to any limitations set forth under Maryland law, our board of directors may increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock, increase or decrease the number of shares of any class or series of stock designated, or reclassify any unissued shares without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P48_S11	All such shares may be issued in the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Existing stockholders and investors purchasing shares in our offering likely will suffer dilution of their equity investment in us if we: (a) sell shares in our offering or sell additional shares in the future, including those issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan; (b) sell securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock; (c) issue shares of our common stock in a private offering of securities to institutional investors; (d) issue restricted share awards to our directors; (e) issue shares to our Advisor or its successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation as set forth under our advisory agreement; or (f) issue shares of our common stock to sellers of properties acquired by us in connection with an exchange of limited partnership interests of the OP.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In addition, the partnership agreement for the OP contains provisions that would allow, under certain circumstances, other entities, including other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs, to merge into or cause the exchange or conversion of their interest for interests of the OP.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Because the limited partnership interests of the OP may, in the discretion of our board of directors, be exchanged for shares of our common stock, any merger, exchange or conversion between the OP and another entity ultimately could result in the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, thereby diluting the percentage ownership interest of other stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Because of these and other reasons described in this Risk Factors section, you should not expect to be able to own a significant percentage of our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Future offerings of equity securities which are senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation may adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity securities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Under our charter, we may issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock or other classes of common stock with rights that could dilute the value of your shares of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Any issuance of preferred stock must be approved by a majority of our independent directors not otherwise interested in the transaction, who will have access, at our expense, to our legal counsel or to independent legal counsel.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Upon liquidation, holders of our shares of preferred stock having a preference as to dividend distributions or upon liquidation will be entitled to receive our available assets prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Additionally, any convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay a liquidating distribution or dividends to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share trading price of our common stock and diluting their interest in us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The value of our common shares was diluted upon conversion of the preferred shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	On December 22, 2009, we commenced a private offering to accredited investors of up to $50.0 million in shares of our 8% series A convertible preferred stock (the "Preferred Shares") subject to an option to increase the offering up to $100.0 million in shares of our preferred stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the private offering, the private offering terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the registration statement.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We received aggregate gross offering proceeds, net of certain discounts, of approximately $16.9 million from the sale of shares in the private offering.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The preferred shares were convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock after September 2, 2011, the first anniversary of the final closing of the private offering, at a conversion price of $9.00 per share (subject to discounts to a price not less than $8.50).
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P54_S4	On December 15, 2011, we exercised our option to convert all our outstanding preferred shares into approximately 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P54_S5	This conversion price was at a discount from the public offering price of our common stock pursuant to our offering and has resulted in dilution of our stockholders interest in us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Payment of fees to our Advisor and its affiliates reduces cash available for investment and distribution.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Our Advisor and its affiliates will perform services for us in connection with the offer and sale of the shares, the selection and acquisition of our investments, and the management and leasing of our properties, the servicing of our mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans, if any, and the administration of our other investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	They are paid substantial fees for these services, which reduces the amount of cash available for investment in properties or distribution to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Such fees and reimbursements include, but are not limited to: (i) a property management fee of 4% per annum of gross revenues from properties managed; (ii) a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the cost our assets; (iii) reimbursement of up to 1.5% of gross offering proceeds for organization and offering expenses; (iv) acquisition fees equal to 1.0% of the contract purchase price of each property or asset that we acquire (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such property) and 1.0% of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such investment), along with reimbursement of acquisition expenses; (v) reimbursement for expenses actually incurred (including personnel costs) related to selecting, evaluating and acquiring assets on our behalf; (vi) a financing coordination fee equal to 0.75% of the amount available and/or outstanding under any debt financing that we obtain and use for the acquisition of properties and other investments or that is assumed, directly or indirectly, in connection with the acquisition of properties; (vii) a real estate commission paid on the sale of property, up to the lesser of 2% and one-half of the total brokerage commission paid if a third party broker is also involved; (viii) a subordinated participation in net sale proceeds equal to 15% of remaining Net Sale Proceeds (as defined in the advisory agreement) after return of capital contributions plus payment to investors of an annual 6% cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded return on the capital contributed by investors; (ix) a subordinated incentive listing fee equal to 15% of the amount by which the sum of our adjusted market value plus distributions exceeds the sum of the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to an annual 6% cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded return to investors; and (x) a subordinated termination fee, in each case subject to the conditions set forth in the advisory agreement.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Because of our holding company structure, we depend on our operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries for cash flow and we will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of such operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	We are a holding company with no business operations of our own.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Our only significant asset is and will be the general partnership interests of our operating partnership.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	We conduct, and intend to conduct, all of our business operations through our operating partnership.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our operating partnership and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S5	We cannot assure you that our operating partnership or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to make distributions to our stockholders from cash flows from operations.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S6	Each of our operating partnership s subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from such entities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S7	In addition, because we are a holding company, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P56_S8	Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy your claims as stockholders only after all of our and our operating partnerships and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate Our operating results will be affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general, and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These and other risks may prevent us from being profitable or from realizing growth or maintaining the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant s lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Such a bankruptcy filing would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Post-bankruptcy debts would be paid currently.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S4	If a lease is assumed, all pre-bankruptcy balances owing under it must be paid in full.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S5	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S6	If a lease is rejected, it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant because our claim is capped at the rent reserved under the lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year or 15% of the remaining term of the lease, but not greater than three years, plus rent already due but unpaid.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S7	This claim could be paid only if funds were available, and then only in the same percentage as that realized on other unsecured claims.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S8	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P59_S9	Such an event could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments that would mean a reduction in our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	In the event of a bankruptcy, we cannot assure you that the tenant or its trustee will assume our lease.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	If a given lease, or guaranty of a lease, is not assumed, our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to you may be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	If a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a tenant s bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition could be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We may enter into sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we would purchase a property and then lease the same property back to the person from whom we purchased it.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In the event of the bankruptcy of a tenant, a transaction structured as a sale-leaseback may be re-characterized as either a financing or a joint venture, either of which outcomes could adversely affect our business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P61_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a financing, we might not be considered the owner of the property, and as a result would have the status of a creditor in relation to the tenant.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In that event, we would no longer have the right to sell or encumber our ownership interest in the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P61_S4	Instead, we would have a claim against the tenant for the amounts owed under the lease, with the claim arguably secured by the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The tenant/debtor might have the ability to propose a plan restructuring the term, interest rate and amortization schedule of its outstanding balance.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	If confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we could be bound by the new terms, and prevented from foreclosing our lien on the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a joint venture, our lessee and we could be treated as co-venturers with regard to the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S3	As a result, we could be held liable, under some circumstances, for debts incurred by the lessee relating to the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Either of these outcomes could adversely affect our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S5	Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S6	If we enter into sale-leaseback transactions, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a true lease for tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S7	However, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge such characterization.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S8	In the event that any such sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S9	If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification asset tests or income tests and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P62_S10	Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Properties that have vacancies for a significant period of time could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	A property may incur vacancies either by the continued default of tenants under their leases or the expiration of tenant leases.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If vacancies continue for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues resulting in less cash to be distributed to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	In addition, because properties market values depend principally upon the value of the properties leases, the resale value of properties with prolonged vacancies could suffer, which could further reduce your return.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property and would have only limited recourse if our due diligence did not identify any issues that lower the value of our property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P65_S1	The seller of a property often sells such property in its as is condition on a where is basis and with all faults, without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In addition, purchase agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk that we may lose some or all our invested capital in the property as well as the loss of rental income from that property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P65_S4	We may be unable to secure funds for future tenant improvements or capital needs, which could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	When tenants do not renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, it is usual that, in order to attract replacement tenants, we will be required to expend substantial funds for tenant improvements and tenant refurbishments to the vacated space.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	In addition, we will likely be responsible for any major structural repairs, such as repairs to the foundation, exterior walls and rooftops, even if our leases with tenants require tenants to pay routine property maintenance costs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	We will use substantially all of our offering s gross proceeds to buy real estate and pay various fees and expenses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S3	We intend to reserve only 0.1% of the gross proceeds from our offering for future capital needs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Accordingly, if we need additional capital in the future to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason, we will have to obtain financing from other sources, such as cash flow from operations, borrowings, property sales or future equity offerings.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S5	These sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S6	If we cannot procure additional funding for capital improvements, our investments may generate lower cash flows or decline in value, or both.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P66_S7	Our inability to sell a property when we desire to do so could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S3	We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S4	We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S5	Moreover, in acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S6	These provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S7	We may not be able to sell our properties at a price equal to, or greater than, the price for which we purchased such property, which may lead to a decrease in the value of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S8	Many of our leases will not contain rental increases over time.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S9	Therefore, the value of the property to a potential purchaser may not increase over time, which may restrict our ability to sell a property, or if we are able to sell such property, may lead to a sale price less than the price that we paid to purchase the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S10	We may acquire or finance properties with lock-out provisions, which may prohibit us from selling a property, or may require us to maintain specified debt levels for a period of years on some properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S11	Lock-out provisions could materially restrict us from selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S12	These provisions would affect our ability to turn our investments into cash and thus affect cash available for distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S13	Lock out provisions may prohibit us from reducing the outstanding indebtedness with respect to any properties, refinancing such indebtedness on a non-recourse basis at maturity, or increasing the amount of indebtedness with respect to such properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S14	Lock-out provisions could impair our ability to take other actions during the lock-out period that could be in the best interests of our stockholders and, therefore, may have an adverse impact on the value of the shares, relative to the value that would result if the lock-out provisions did not exist.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P67_S15	In particular, lock-out provisions could preclude us from participating in major transactions that could result in a disposition of our assets or a change in control even though that disposition or change in control might be in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Any properties that we buy in the future will be, subject to operating risks common to real estate in general, any or all of which may negatively affect us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S1	If any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses, we could be required to expend funds with respect to that property for operating expenses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S2	The properties will be subject to increases in tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S3	If renewals of leases or future leases are not negotiated on a triple-net-lease basis or do not require the tenants to pay all or a portion of such expenses, we may have to pay those costs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S4	If we are unable to lease properties on a triple-net-lease basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, or if tenants fail to pay required tax, utility and other impositions, we could be required to pay those costs which could adversely affect funds available for future acquisitions or cash available for distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S5	If we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S6	We will carry comprehensive general liability coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties with limits of liability which we deem adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P69_S7	Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we estimate to be adequate to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the rehabilitation period.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Material losses may occur in excess of insurance proceeds with respect to any property, as insurance may not be sufficient to fund the losses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	However, there are types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Insurance risks associated with potential terrorism acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase specific coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S2	It is uncertain whether such insurance policies will be available, or available at reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our potential properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S3	In these instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S4	We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S5	The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 is designed for a sharing of terrorism losses between insurance companies and the federal government, and extends the federal terrorism insurance backstop through 2014.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S6	We cannot be certain how this act will impact us or what additional cost to us, if any, could result.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S7	If such an event damaged or destroyed one or more of our properties, we could lose both our invested capital and anticipated profits from such property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S8	Real estate related taxes may increase and if these increases are not passed on to tenants, our income will be reduced.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S9	Some local real property tax assessors may seek to reassess some of our properties as a result of our acquisition of the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P71_S10	Generally, from time to time our property taxes increase as property values or assessment rates change or for other reasons deemed relevant by the assessors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	An increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes will result in an increase in the related real estate taxes on that property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	There is no assurance that renewal leases or future leases will be negotiated on the same basis, even if some tenant leases permit us to pass through such tax increases to the tenants for payment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Increases not passed through to tenants will adversely affect our income, cash available for distributions, and the amount of distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	CC Rs may restrict our ability to operate a property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Some of our properties may be contiguous to other parcels of real property, comprising part of the same commercial center.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In connection with such properties, there are significant covenants, conditions and restrictions, known as CC Rs, restricting the operation of such properties and any improvements on such properties, and related to granting easements on such properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Moreover, the operation and management of the contiguous properties may impact such properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Compliance with CC Rs may adversely affect our operating costs and reduce the amount of funds that we have available to pay distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Our operating results may be negatively affected by potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We may use proceeds from our offering to acquire and develop properties upon which we will construct improvements.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	We will be subject to uncertainties associated with re-zoning for development, environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups, and our builder s ability to build in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs, and timetables.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S3	If a builder fails to perform, we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S4	A builder s performance also may be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder s control.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Delays in completion of construction could also give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S6	We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S7	These and other such factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S8	In addition, we will be subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S9	We also must rely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a price at the time we acquire the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S10	If our projections are inaccurate, we may pay too much for a property, and our return on our investment could suffer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S11	We may invest in unimproved real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S12	For purposes of this paragraph, unimproved real property does not include properties acquired for the purpose of producing rental or other operating income, properties under development or construction, and properties under contract for development or in planning for development within one year.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P74_S13	Returns from development of unimproved properties are also subject to risks associated with re-zoning the land for development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	If we invest unimproved property other than property we intend to develop, your investment will be subject to the risks associated with investments in unimproved real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Competition with third parties in acquiring properties and other investments may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S2	We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, bank and insurance company investment accounts, other REITs, real estate limited partnerships, and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, many of which have greater resources than we do.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Larger REITs may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S4	In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investments may increase.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S5	Any such increase would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S6	If we pay higher prices for properties and other investments, our profitability will be reduced and you may experience a lower return on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S7	Our properties face competition that may affect tenants ability to pay rent and the amount of rent paid to us may affect the cash available for distributions and the amount of distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S8	Our properties typically are, and we expect will be, located in developed areas such as the New York MSA.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S9	Therefore, there are and will be numerous other properties within the market area of each of our properties that will compete with us for tenants.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S10	The number of competitive properties could have a material effect on our ability to rent space at our properties and the amount of rents charged.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S11	We could be adversely affected if additional competitive properties are built in locations competitive with our properties, causing increased competition for customer traffic and creditworthy tenants.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S12	This could result in decreased cash flow from tenants and may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise made, thus affecting cash available for distributions, and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S13	We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S14	We cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above our existing rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or tenant-favorable renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S15	If the rental rates of our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to satisfy our principal and interest obligations would be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P75_S16	Moreover, the resale value of our property could be diminished because the market value of the property depends upon the value of the leases of the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Delays in acquisitions of properties may have an adverse effect on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P76_S1	There may be a substantial period of time before the proceeds of our offering are invested.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Delays we encounter in the selection, acquisition and/or development of properties could adversely affect your returns.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Where properties are acquired prior to the start of construction or during the early stages of construction, it will typically take several months to complete construction and rent available space.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Therefore, you could suffer delays in the payment of cash distributions attributable to those particular properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P77_S2	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for any distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S1	These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S3	In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S5	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S6	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S7	Additionally, our tenants operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S8	In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply, and that may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P78_S9	Any material expenditures, fines, or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to make distributions and may reduce the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S0	State and federal laws in this area are constantly evolving, and we intend to monitor these laws and take commercially reasonable steps to protect ourselves from the impact of these laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of most properties that we acquire; however, we will not obtain an independent third-party environmental assessment for every property we acquire.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S1	In addition, any such assessment that we do obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities or that a prior owner of a property did not create a material environmental condition not known to us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S2	The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims would materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S3	If we sell properties by providing financing to purchasers, defaults by the purchasers would adversely affect our cash flows.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S4	If we decide to sell any of our properties, we intend to use our best efforts to sell them for cash.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S5	However, in some instances we may sell our properties by providing financing to purchasers.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S6	When we provide financing to purchasers, we will bear the risk that the purchaser may default, which could negatively impact our cash distributions to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S7	Even in the absence of a purchaser default, the distribution of the proceeds of sales to our stockholders, or their reinvestment in other assets, will be delayed until the promissory notes or other property we may accept upon the sale are actually paid, sold, refinanced or otherwise disposed of.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S8	In some cases, we may receive initial down payments in cash and other property in the year of sale in an amount less than the selling price and subsequent payments will be spread over a number of years.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S9	If any purchaser defaults under a financing arrangement with us, it could negatively impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S10	Our recovery of an investment in a mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loan that has defaulted may be limited.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P79_S11	There is no guarantee that the mortgage, loan or deed of trust securing an investment will, following a default, permit us to recover the original investment and interest that would have been received absent a default.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The security provided by a mortgage, deed of trust or loan is directly related to the difference between the amount owed and the appraised market value of the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Even though we intend to rely on a current real estate appraisal when we make the investment, the value of the property is affected by factors outside our control, including general fluctuations in the real estate market, rezoning, neighborhood changes, highway relocations and failure by the borrower to maintain the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In addition, we may incur the costs of litigation in our efforts to enforce our rights under defaulted loans.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Our properties will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Disabilities Act).
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P81_S3	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P81_S4	The Disabilities Act s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We will attempt to acquire properties that comply with the Disabilities Act or place the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with the Disabilities Act.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P82_S1	However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P82_S2	If we cannot, our funds used for Disabilities Act compliance may affect cash available for distributions and the amount of distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Economic conditions may adversely affect our income and we could be subject to risks associated with acquiring discounted real estate assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P83_S0	U.S. and international markets are currently experiencing increased levels of volatility due to a combination of many factors, including decreasing values of home prices, limited access to credit markets, higher fuel prices and less consumer spending.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The effects of the current market dislocation may persist as financial institutions continue to take the necessary steps to restructure their business and capital structures.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P83_S2	As a result, this economic downturn has reduced demand for space and removed support for rents and property values.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Since we cannot predict when the real estate markets will recover, the value of our properties may decline if current market conditions persist or worsen.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S1	In addition, we will be subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of discounted real estate assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Such assets may be purchased at a discount from historical cost due to, among other things, substantial deferred maintenance, abandonment, undesirable locations or markets, or poorly structured financing of the real estate or debt instruments underlying the assets, which has since lowered their value.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Further, the continuing instability in the financial markets has limited the availability of lines of credit and the degree to which people and entities have access to cash to pay rents or debt service on the underlying the assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S4	Such illiquidity has the effect of increasing vacancies, increasing bankruptcies and weakening interest rates commercial entities can charge consumers, which can all decrease the value of already discounted real estate assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S5	Should conditions worsen, the continued inability of the underlying real estate assets to produce income may weaken our return on our investments, which, in turn, may weaken your return on investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S6	Further, irrespective of the instability the financial markets may have on the return produced by discounted real estate assets, the evolving efforts to correct the instability make the valuation of such assets highly unpredictable.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S7	The fluctuation in market conditions make judging the future performance of such assets difficult.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P84_S8	There is a risk that we may not purchase real estate assets at absolute discounted rates and that such assets may continue to decline in value.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Retail Industry Risks Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P85_S1	A retail property s revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our common stock may be negatively impacted.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Some of our leases may provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P85_S4	A number of our retail leases also may include a percentage rent clause for additional rent above the base amount based upon a specified percentage of the sales our tenants generate.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Under those leases which contain percentage rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P86_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we may derive from percentage rent leases could decline upon a general economic downturn.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P88_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our financial condition.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P89_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant s lease is terminated.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S1	These co-tenancy provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S8	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S9	If we acquire retail properties, our retail tenants will face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs, internet websites and telemarketing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S10	Other retail centers within the market area of our properties will compete with our properties for customers, affecting their tenants cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S11	In addition, some of our tenants rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P90_S12	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Office Industry Risks Declines in overall activity in our markets may adversely affect the performance of our office properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Our office properties may be adversely affected by the unprecedented volatility and illiquidity in the financial and credit markets, the general global economic recession, and other market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Because our portfolio will include commercial office buildings located principally in Manhattan, if economic conditions persist or deteriorate, then our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service current debt and to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by the following, among other potential conditions:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P93_S0	that reduced liquidity in debt markets and increased credit risk premiums for certain market participants may impair our ability to access capital.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P93_S1	These conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions, may continue or worsen in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P93_S2	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P93_S4	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S0	The loss of anchor tenants for our office properties could adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S1	We may acquire office properties and, as with our retail properties, we are subject to the risk that tenants may be unable to make their lease payments or may decline to extend a lease upon its expiration.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S2	A lease termination by a tenant that occupies a large area of space in one of our office properties (commonly referred to as an anchor tenant) could impact leases of other tenants.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of a lease termination by an anchor tenant or the closure of the business of an anchor tenant that leaves its space vacant, even if the anchor tenant continues to pay rent.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S4	Any such modifications or conditions could be unfavorable to us as the property owner and could decrease rents or expense recoveries.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S5	In the event of default by an anchor tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S6	Residential Industry Risks The short-term nature of our residential leases may adversely impact our income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S7	If our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their units.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S8	Because substantially all our residential leases will be for apartments, they generally will be for terms of no more than one or two years.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P94_S9	If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P95_S0	Certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances result in a reduction in rental income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P96_S0	An economic downturn could adversely affect the residential industry and may affect operations for the residential properties that we acquire.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P96_S1	As a result of the effects of an economic downturn, including increased unemployment rates, the residential industry may experience a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in overall renters.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P96_S2	The current economic downturn and increase in unemployment rates may have an adverse effect on our operations if the tenants occupying the residential and office properties we acquire cease making rent payments to us or if there a change in spending patterns resulting in reduced traffic at the retail properties we acquire.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Moreover, low residential mortgage interest rates could accompany an economic downturn and encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P96_S4	The residential properties we acquire may experience declines in occupancy rate due to any such decline in residential mortgage interest rates.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P97_S0	The hotel industry is very competitive and seasonal and has been affected by economic slowdowns, terrorist attacks and other world events.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S0	The hotel industry is intensely competitive and seasonal in nature and has been affected by the current economic slowdown, terrorist attacks, military activity in the Middle East, natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy and the travel and hotel industries, and, as a result, our lodging properties may be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Since the hotel industry is intensely competitive, our third-party management company and our third-party tenants may be unable to compete successfully or if our competitors marketing strategies are more effective, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders, may be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S2	In particular, as a result of terrorist attacks around the world, the war in Iraq and the effects of the economic recession, subsequent to 2001 the lodging industry experienced a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in both business and leisure travel.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Our business and lodging properties may continue to be affected by such events, including our hotel occupancy levels and average daily rates, and, as a result, our revenues may decrease or not increase to levels we expect.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Since we do not intend to operate our lodging properties, our revenues depend on the ability of our third-party management company and our-third party tenants to compete successfully with other hotels in the New York MSA.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S5	Some of our competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S6	If our third-party management company and our third-party tenants are unable to compete successfully, including competition from Internet intermediaries, or if our competitors marketing strategies are effective, our results of operations, financial condition, ability to service debt and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P98_S7	In addition, the seasonality of the hotel industry can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and also may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, such as extreme or unexpectedly mild weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P99_S0	To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues, we may attempt to borrow in order to make distributions to our stockholders or be required to reduce other expenditures or distributions to stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Our profitability may be adversely affected by unstable market and business conditions and insufficient demand for lodging due to reduced business and leisure travel.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Our hotels will be subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P100_S2	These risks could adversely affect hotel occupancy and the rates that can be charged for hotel rooms as well as hotel operating expenses, and generally include:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P101_S0	risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate, as discussed below.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P101_S1	We do not have control over the market and business conditions that affect the value of our lodging properties, and adverse changes with respect to such conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Hotel properties are subject to varying degrees of risk generally common to the ownership of hotels, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P102_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Adverse changes in any or all these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, thereby adversely impacting our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S0	As a REIT, we cannot directly operate our lodging properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, which could impact our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S1	We cannot and will not directly operate our lodging properties and, as a result, our results of operations, financial position, ability to service debt and our ability to make distributions to stockholders are dependent on the ability of our third-party management companies and our tenants to operate our hotel properties successfully.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S2	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly operate any lodging properties we may acquire or actively participate in the decisions affecting their daily operations.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Instead, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, or a TRS lessee, we must enter into management agreements with a third-party management company, or we must lease our lodging properties to third-party tenants on a triple-net lease basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S4	We cannot and will not control this third-party management company or the tenants who operate and are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of our lodging properties, including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S5	Thus, even if we believe our lodging properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party management company or the tenants to change their method of operation of our lodging properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S6	Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and our ability to service debt and to make distributions to stockholders are, therefore, dependent on the ability of our third-party management company and tenants to operate our lodging properties successfully.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S7	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator and/or its affiliated brands generally may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and consequently cash flows thereby impacting our ability to service debt, and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P103_S8	There can be no assurance that our affiliate continues to manage any lodging properties we acquire.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S0	We will rely on a third-party hotel management company to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S1	In doing this, the property manager should have policies and procedures in place which allow it to effectively monitor and report to us the operating results of our lodging properties which ultimately are included in our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Because the operations of our lodging properties ultimately become a component of our consolidated financial statements, we evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting at all our properties, including our lodging properties, in connection with the certifications we provide in our quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S3	However, we will not control the design or implementation of or changes to internal controls at any of our lodging properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Thus, even if we believe that our lodging properties are being operated without effective internal controls, we may not be able to require the third-party management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S5	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S6	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S7	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party management company will implement at our lodging properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S8	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at one or more of our lodging properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S9	If we replace a third-party management company or tenant, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement or lease to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at the affected lodging properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S10	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party management company or tenants with substantial prior lodging experience in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S11	If we experience such disruptions, it may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P104_S12	Industrial Industry Risks Potential liability as the result of, and the cost of compliance with, environmental matters is greater if we invest in industrial properties or lease our properties to tenants that engage in industrial activities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on such property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P106_S0	We may invest in properties historically used for industrial, manufacturing and commercial purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P106_S1	Some of these properties are more likely to contain, or may have contained, underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P106_S2	All of these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P107_S0	Leasing properties to tenants that engage in industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities will cause us to be subject to increased risk of liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P107_S1	The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P107_S2	The demand for and profitability of our industrial properties may be adversely affected by fluctuations in manufacturing activity in the United States.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Our industrial properties may be adversely affected if manufacturing activity decreases in the United States.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Trade agreements with foreign countries have given employers the option to utilize less expensive non-US manufacturing workers.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P109_S1	The outsourcing of manufacturing functions could lower the demand for our industrial properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Moreover, an increase in the cost of raw materials or decrease in the demand of housing could cause a slowdown in manufacturing activity, such as furniture, textiles, machinery and chemical products, and our profitability may be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Our portfolio may be negatively impacted by a high concentration of industrial tenants in a single industry.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P109_S4	If we invest in industrial properties, we may lease properties to tenants that engage in similar industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P109_S5	A high concentration of tenants in a specific industry would magnify the adverse impact that a downturn in such industry might otherwise have to our portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P110_S0	We may incur mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings, which may increase our business risks.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P111_S0	We expect that in most instances, we will acquire real properties by using either existing financing or borrowing new funds.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P111_S1	In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge all or some of our real properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P112_S0	We may borrow if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P112_S1	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Our Advisor believes that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objective of maximizing the return to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S0	There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Under our charter, our borrowings may not exceed 300% of our total net assets (as defined by the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S2	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S3	In addition, it is our intention to limit our borrowings to 40% to 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets (calculated after the close of our offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our offering), unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for such excess borrowing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S4	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S5	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S6	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S7	We expect that during the period of our offering we will seek independent director approval of borrowings in excess of these limitations since we will then be in the process of raising our equity capital to acquire our portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P114_S8	As a result, we expect that our debt levels will be higher until we have invested most of our capital.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P115_S0	If there is a shortfall between the cash flow from a property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on a property, then the amount available for distributions to stockholders may be reduced.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P115_S1	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P115_S2	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P115_S3	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P115_S4	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P115_S5	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of distributions required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P116_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P116_S1	When we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P117_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P117_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P117_S2	The current state of debt markets could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The domestic and international commercial real estate debt markets are currently experiencing volatility as a result of certain factors including the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S1	This is resulting in lenders increasing the cost for debt financing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S2	Should the overall cost of borrowings increase, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, we will need to factor such increases into the economics of future acquisitions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S3	This may result in future acquisitions generating lower overall economic returns and potentially reducing future cash flow available for distribution.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S4	If these disruptions in the debt markets persist, our ability to borrow monies to finance the purchase of, or other activities related to, real estate assets will be negatively impacted.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S5	If we are unable to borrow monies on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, we likely will have to reduce the number of properties we can purchase, and the return on the properties we do purchase may be lower.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S6	In addition, we may find it difficult, costly or impossible to refinance indebtedness which is maturing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S7	In addition, the state of the debt markets could have an impact on the overall amount of capital invested in real estate which may result in price or value decreases of real estate assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P118_S8	This could negatively impact the current value of our existing assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S0	High mortgage rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire and the amount of cash distributions we can make.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S1	If we place mortgage debt on properties, we run the risk of being unable to refinance the properties when the loans come due, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S2	If interest rates are higher when the properties are refinanced, we may not be able to finance the properties and our income could be reduced.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S3	If any of these events occur, our cash flow would be reduced.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S4	This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution to you and may hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S5	Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S6	In connection with providing us financing, a lender could impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S7	Loan documents we enter into may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property, discontinue insurance coverage or replace New York Recovery Advisors, LLC as our Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S8	These or other limitations may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our investment and operating objectives.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S9	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S10	We expect that we will incur indebtedness in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S11	To the extent that we incur variable rate debt, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay distributions to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S12	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S13	We have broad authority to incur debt, and high debt levels could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S14	Under our charter, our borrowings may not exceed 300% of our total net assets (as defined by the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S15	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S16	In addition, it is our intention to limit our aggregate borrowings to 40% to 50% of the fair market value of all of our assets (calculated after the close of our offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our offering), unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with a justification for such excess borrowing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S17	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S18	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S19	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S20	We expect that during the period of our offering we will seek independent director approval of borrowings in excess of these limitations since we will then be in the process of raising our equity capital to acquire our portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S21	As a result, we expect that our debt levels will be higher until we have invested most of our capital.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S22	High debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges, would result in higher debt service payments and could be accompanied by restrictive covenants.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P119_S23	These factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P120_S0	We may invest in CMBS, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk and the risks of the securitization process.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P121_S0	We may invest in CMBS, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P121_S1	We have not adopted, and do not expect to adopt, any formal policies or procedures designed to manage risks associated with our investments in CMBS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P122_S0	In this context, credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P123_S0	Interest rate risk occurs as prevailing market interest rates change relative to the current yield on the CMBS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P123_S1	For example, when interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their existing mortgages to take advantage of the lower cost of financing.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P123_S2	As prepayments occur, principal is returned to the holders of the CMBS sooner than expected, thereby lowering the effective yield on the investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P123_S3	On the other hand, when interest rates rise, borrowers are more likely to maintain their existing mortgages.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P123_S4	As a result, prepayments decrease, thereby extending the average maturity of the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P124_S0	CMBS are also subject to several risks created through the securitization process.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Subordinate CMBS are paid interest only to the extent that there are funds available to make payments.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P125_S1	To the extent the collateral pool includes delinquent loans, there is a risk that the interest payment on subordinate CMBS will not be fully paid.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P125_S2	Subordinate CMBS are also subject to greater credit risk than those CMBS that are more highly rated.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P125_S3	If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you will be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Any real estate debt security that we originate or purchase is subject to the risks of delinquency and foreclosure.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P127_S0	We may originate and purchase real estate debt securities, which are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P127_S1	Typically, we will not have recourse to the personal assets of our borrowers.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P128_S0	The ability of a borrower to repay a real estate debt security secured by an income-producing property depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property, rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P128_S1	If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower s ability to repay the real estate debt security may be impaired.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P128_S2	A property s net operating income can be affected by, among other things:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P129_S0	increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P130_S0	We bear the risks of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the real estate debt security, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P131_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a real estate debt security borrower, the real estate debt security to that borrower will be deemed to be collateralized only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the real estate debt security will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Foreclosure of a real estate debt security can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed real estate debt security.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S1	We also may be forced to foreclose on certain properties, be unable to sell these properties and be forced to incur substantial expenses to improve operations at the property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S2	U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and the market price of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S3	We believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ending December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S4	However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in the best interests of our stockholders, or inadvertently.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S5	Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S6	We intend to structure our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S7	However, the REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S8	Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S9	Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S10	Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S11	Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization could jeopardize our ability to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P132_S12	Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S0	If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S1	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT status.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S2	Losing our REIT status would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S3	In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S4	If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S5	Even REITs, in certain circumstances, may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S6	Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may become subject to U.S. federal income taxes and related state and local taxes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P133_S7	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are dealer properties sold by a REIT (a prohibited transaction under the Internal Revenue Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P134_S0	We may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P134_S1	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay income tax directly on such income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P134_S2	In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P134_S3	However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P134_S4	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our Operating Partnership or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P134_S5	Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P135_S0	To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P135_S1	This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P136_S0	In order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for distributions paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P136_S1	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income, (ii) 95% of our capital gain net income and (iii) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P136_S2	These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P137_S0	Although we intend to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT, it is possible that we might not always be able to do so.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P137_S1	Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P138_S0	For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition is restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P138_S1	Under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of trade or business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P139_S0	Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P139_S1	While we qualify as a REIT, we avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (1) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS will incur income taxes), (2) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction or (3) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with a prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for properties held for at least two years.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P139_S2	However, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P139_S3	Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P140_S0	A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P140_S1	Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P140_S2	A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P140_S3	Overall, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P141_S0	A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P141_S1	We must operate our qualified lodging facilities through one or more TRS that lease such properties from us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P141_S2	We may use our TRSs generally for other activities as well, such as to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P142_S0	A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P142_S1	In addition, the rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P143_S0	If our leases to our TRSs are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified percentages of our gross income must be derived from certain sources, such as rents from real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S1	In order for such rent to qualify as rents from real property for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S2	If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S3	If our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S4	We intend to maintain the status of the operating partnership as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S5	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of the operating partnership as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S6	In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S7	This also would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S8	This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the yield on your investment.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S9	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S10	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S11	If our qualified lodging facilities are not properly leased to a TRS or the managers of such qualified lodging facilities do not qualify as eligible independent contractors, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P144_S12	In general, we cannot operate any lodging facilities and can only indirectly participate in the operation of qualified lodging facilities on an after-tax basis through leases of such properties to our TRSs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P145_S0	A qualified lodging facility is a hotel, motel, or other establishment in which more than one-half of the dwelling units are used on a transient basis at which or in connection with which wagering activities are not conducted.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Rent paid by a lessee that is a related party tenant of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P145_S2	A TRS that leases lodging facilities from us will not be treated as a related party tenant with respect to our lodging facilities that are managed by an independent management company, so long as the independent management company qualifies as an eligible independent contractor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P145_S3	Each of the management companies that enters into a management contract with our TRSs must qualify as an eligible independent contractor under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to us by our TRSs to be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P145_S4	An eligible independent contractor is an independent contractor that, at the time such contractor enters into a management or other agreement with a TRS to operate a qualified lodging facility, is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating qualified lodging facilities for any person not related, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, to us or the TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P145_S5	Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an independent contractor a manager must not own, directly or applying attribution provisions of the Code, more than 35% of our outstanding shares of stock (by value), and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and 35% of the ownership interests of the manager (taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interest in such managers that are publicly traded, only holders of more than 5% of such ownership interests).
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P146_S0	The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of the 35% thresholds are complex.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P146_S1	Although we intend to monitor ownership of our stock by our managers and their owners, there can be no assurance that these ownership levels will not be exceeded.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S0	Our investments in certain debt instruments may cause us to recognize phantom income for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though no cash payments have been received on the debt instruments, and certain modifications of such debt by us could cause the modified debt to not qualify as a good REIT asset, thereby jeopardizing our REIT qualification.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S1	Our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S2	For example, we may acquire assets, including debt securities requiring us to accrue original issue discount, or OID, or recognize market discount income, that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets referred to as phantom income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S3	In addition, if a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S4	As a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S5	In such circumstances, we may be required to (a) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (b) borrow on unfavorable terms, (c) distribute amounts that would otherwise be used for future acquisitions or used to repay debt, or (d) make a taxable distribution of our shares of common stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares of common stock or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S6	Moreover, we may acquire distressed debt investments that require subsequent modification by agreement with the borrower.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S7	If the amendments to the outstanding debt are significant modifications under the applicable Treasury Regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt taxable exchange with the borrower.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S8	This deemed reissuance may prevent the modified debt from qualifying as a good REIT asset if the underlying security has declined in value and would cause us to recognize income to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S9	The failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S10	In general, in order for a loan to be treated as a qualifying real estate asset producing qualifying income for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, the loan must be secured by real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S11	We may acquire mezzanine loans that are not directly secured by real property but instead secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S12	In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan that is not secured by real estate would, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S13	Although the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law and in many cases it may not be possible for us to meet all the requirements of the safe harbor.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S14	We cannot provide assurance that any mezzanine loan in which we invest would be treated as a qualifying asset producing qualifying income for REIT qualification purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S15	If any such loan fails either the REIT income or asset tests, we may be disqualified as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S16	We may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S17	In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S18	In order to satisfy this requirement, we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash and shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S19	Generally, under IRS Revenue Procedure 2010-12, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend with respect to the taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2011 could be payable in our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S20	Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S21	As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S22	Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S23	If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S24	Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P147_S25	In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sale may put downward pressure on the price of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P148_S0	Further, while Revenue Procedure 2010-12 applies only to taxable dividends payable by us in a combination of cash and stock with respect to the taxable years ending on or before December 31, 2011, it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to pay taxable dividends in cash and stock in later years.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P148_S1	Moreover, various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock dividend are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P148_S2	No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose additional requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock dividends, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock dividends have not been met.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P149_S0	Distributions that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P149_S1	Distributions that we make to our taxable stockholders out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends, or, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013, qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P149_S2	However, a portion of our distributions may (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (2) be designated by us, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013, as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from our TRSs, or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P150_S0	A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder s investment in our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P150_S1	Our stockholders may have tax liability on distributions that they elect to reinvest in common stock, but they would not receive the cash from such distributions to pay such tax liability.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P150_S2	If our stockholders participate in our distribution reinvestment program, they will be deemed to have received, and for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed on, the amount reinvested in shares of our common stock to the extent the amount reinvested was not a tax-free return of capital.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P150_S3	In addition, our stockholders will be treated for tax purposes as having received an additional distribution to the extent the shares are purchased at a discount to fair market value.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P150_S4	As a result, unless a stockholder is a tax-exempt entity, it may have to use funds from other sources to pay its tax liability on the value of the shares of common stock received.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S0	Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S1	The maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates has been reduced by legislation to 15% for tax years beginning before January 1, 2013.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S2	Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the reduced rates.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S3	Although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S4	If we were considered to actually or constructively pay a preferential dividend to certain of our stockholders, our status as a REIT could be adversely affected.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S5	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S6	In order for distributions to be counted as satisfying the annual distribution requirements for REITs, and to provide us with a REIT-level tax deduction, the distributions must not be preferential dividends.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P151_S7	A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P152_S0	Currently, there is uncertainty as to the IRS s position regarding whether certain arrangements that REITs have with their stockholders could give rise to the inadvertent payment of a preferential dividend (e.g., the pricing methodology for stock purchased under a distribution reinvestment program inadvertently causing a greater than 5% discount on the price of such stock purchased).
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P152_S1	There is no de minimis exception with respect to preferential dividends; therefore, if the IRS were to take the position that we inadvertently paid a preferential dividend, we may be deemed to have failed the 90% distribution test, and our status as a REIT could be terminated for the year in which such determination is made if we were unable to cure such failure.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P152_S2	While we believe that our operations have been structured in such a manner that we will not be treated as inadvertently paying preferential dividends, we can provide no assurance to this effect.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P153_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P153_S1	The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P153_S2	Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P153_S3	To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P153_S4	As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P153_S5	This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P153_S6	In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S1	The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S2	In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more TRS.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S4	As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S5	These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S6	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S7	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S8	While we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we may not elect to be treated as a REIT or may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S9	If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders and on the market price of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P155_S10	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P156_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P156_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P156_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P156_S3	You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P156_S4	You also should note that our counsel s tax opinion was based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P157_S0	Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P157_S1	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P157_S2	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P158_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, distributions received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P158_S2	Such dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S0	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, capital gain distributions attributable to sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests, or USRPIs, generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S1	However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 5% of the class of our stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date the distribution is received.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S2	We do not anticipate that our shares will be regularly traded on an established securities market for the foreseeable future, and therefore, this exception is not expected to apply.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S3	Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S4	Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S5	A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT s stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S6	We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S7	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if (a) our common stock is regularly traded, as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S8	However, it is not anticipated that our common stock will be regularly traded on an established market.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P159_S9	We encourage you to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences applicable to you if you are a non-U.S. stockholder.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P160_S0	Potential characterization of distributions or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax-exempt investors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P160_S1	If (a) we are a pension-held REIT, (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P161_S0	In order to avoid triggering additional taxes and/or penalties, if you intend to invest in our shares through pension or profit-sharing trusts or IRAs, you should consider additional factors.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Our management has attempted to structure us in such a manner that we will be an attractive investment vehicle for pension, profit-sharing, 401(k), Keogh and other qualified retirement plans and IRAs.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P161_S2	However, in considering an investment in our shares, those involved with making such an investment decision should consider applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA").
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P161_S3	While each of the ERISA and Internal Revenue Code issues discussed below may not apply to all such plans and IRAs, individuals involved with making investment decisions with respect to such plans and IRAs should carefully review the items described below, and determine their applicability to their situation.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P161_S4	Any such prospective investors are required to consult their own legal and tax advisors on these matters.
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P161_S5	In general, individuals making investment decisions with respect to such plans and IRAs should, at a minimum, consider:
1474464_12_ITEM1A_P162_S0	whether the investment would constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code, if applicable.

1474464_12_ITEM2_P13_S1	(2) Mortgage debt divided by base purchase price, without regard to the $10.2 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2011 .
1474464_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	No public market currently exists for our shares of common stock, and we currently have no plans to list our shares on a national securities exchange.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	Until our shares are listed, if ever, our stockholders may not sell their shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum purchase requirements.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P0_S2	In addition, our charter prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% of our stock, unless exempted by our board of directors.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P0_S3	Consequently, there is the risk that our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares at a time or price acceptable to them.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P0_S4	Pursuant to our offering, we are selling shares of our common stock to the public at a price of $10.00 per share and at $9.50 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	In order for Financial Industry Regulatory Authority members and their associated persons to participate in the offering and sale of shares of common stock pursuant to our offering, we are required pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(f)(2)(M) to disclose in each annual report distributed to stockholders a per share estimated value of the shares, the method by which it was developed and the date of the data used to develop the estimated value.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	In addition, we prepare annual statements of estimated share values to assist fiduciaries of retirement plans subject to the annual reporting requirements of ERISA in the preparation of their reports relating to an investment in our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	During our offering the value of the shares is deemed to be the offering price of $10.00 per share (without regard to purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers), as adjusted for any special distribution of net sales proceeds.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P1_S3	There is no public trading market for the shares at this time, and there can be no assurance that stockholders would receive $10.00 per share if such a market did exist and they sold their shares or that they will be able to receive such amount for their shares in the future.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P1_S4	Nor does this deemed value reflect the distributions that stockholders would be entitled to receive if our properties were sold and the sale proceeds were distributed upon liquidation of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P1_S5	Such a distribution upon liquidation may be less than $10.00 per share primarily due to the fact that the funds initially available for investment in properties were reduced from the gross offering proceeds in order to pay selling commissions and dealer manager fees, organization and offering expenses, and acquisition and advisory fees.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	As of February 15, 2012 , we had 7.4 million shares of common stock outstanding held by a total of 1,939 stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P2_S1	We have elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P2_S2	As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P2_S3	The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P2_S4	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors declared a distribution rate equal to a 6.05% annualized rate based on the common share price of $10.00, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P2_S5	The distributions are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P2_S6	The dividend is calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P3_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P3_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P3_S2	The first distribution was paid in January 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P3_S3	The following table reflects distributions paid in cash and through the DRIP to common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM5_P4_S0	Our Preferred Shares paid cumulative dividends monthly in arrears at the annualized rate of 8% on the liquidation preference of $9.00, resulting in a dividend rate of 8.23%, through December 15, 2011, when Preferred Shares were converted to common shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P4_S1	The following table reflects dividends paid to Preferred Shares during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S0	We, our board of directors and Advisor share a similar philosophy with respect to paying our distribution.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S1	The distribution should principally be derived from cash flows generated from real estate operations.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S2	In order to improve our operating cash flows and our ability to pay dividends from operating cash flows, our related party Advisor and Property Manager agreed to waive certain fees including asset management and property management fees.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S3	We pay the Advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the aggregate contract purchase price of all real estate investments, and we pay our Property Manager a property management fee of up to 4% per annum of the gross revenues of properties managed.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S4	The Advisor has elected to waive the asset management fees, and the Property Manager has elected to waive the property management fees, which together aggregated $0.8 million and $0.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S5	The Advisor and Property Manager will determine if a portion or all of such fees will be waived in subsequent periods on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S6	The fees that were waived are not deferrals and accordingly, will not be paid by us.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S7	Because the Advisor waived certain fees that we owed, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor and the Property Manager was available to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S8	In certain instances, to improve our working capital, the Advisor may elect to absorb a portion of our costs that would otherwise have been paid by us.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S9	During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the Advisor absorbed $0.9 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S10	Additionally, the Advisor at its election may contribute capital to enhance our cash position for distribution purposes.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S11	Any contributed capital amounts are not reimbursable to our Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S12	Further, any capital contributions are made without any corresponding issuance of common or preferred shares of beneficial interest.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S13	The Advisor contributed approximately $15,000 and $0.1 million to us during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S14	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , cash used to pay our distributions was generated mainly from funds received from property operating results, refinancings and the sale of our common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S15	As additional capital is raised and we continue to build our portfolio of investments, we expect that we will use funds received from operating activities to pay a greater proportion of our distributions and will be able to reduce and in the future eliminate the use of funds from the sale of common stock to pay distributions .
1474464_12_ITEM5_P5_S16	As the cash flows from operations become more significant our Advisor may discontinue its past practice of forgiving fees and providing contributions and may charge the full fee owed to it in accordance with our agreements with the Advisor.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P6_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P6_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P7_S0	Share-Based Compensation Plans We have a stock option plan (the Plan ) which authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options to our independent directors, subject to the absolute discretion of the board of directors and the applicable limitations of the Plan.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P7_S1	The exercise price for all stock options granted under the Plan will be fixed at $10.00 per share until the termination of the IPO, and thereafter the exercise price for stock options granted to the independent directors will be equal to the fair market value of a share on the last business day preceding the annual meeting of stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P7_S2	A total of 500,000 shares have been authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P7_S3	Notwithstanding any other provisions of our Plan to the contrary, no stock option issued pursuant thereto may be exercised if such exercise would jeopardize our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P8_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our stock option plan as of December 31, 2011 :
1474464_12_ITEM5_P9_S0	Restricted Share Plan On September 22, 2010, our board of directors adopted an employee and director incentive restricted share plan (the RSP ).
1474464_12_ITEM5_P9_S1	The RSP provides for the automatic grant of 3,000 restricted shares of common stock to each of the independent directors, without any further action by our board of directors or the stockholders, on the date of each annual stockholder s meeting.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P9_S2	Restricted stock issued to independent directors will vest over a five-year period following the first anniversary of the date of grant in increments of 20% per annum.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P10_S0	The RSP provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain of our consultants and certain consultants to the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P10_S1	The total number of common shares reserved for issuance under the RSP is equal to 5.0% of our authorized shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P11_S0	Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive common shares from us under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P11_S1	Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient s employment or other relationship with us.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P12_S0	Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P12_S1	Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P12_S2	Any distributions payable in common shares shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P13_S0	There were 13,800 unvested shares outstanding under the RSP at December 31, 2011 .
1474464_12_ITEM5_P14_S0	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities We did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act during the year s ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the period from October 6, 2009 to December 31, 2009, other than our initial unregistered sale to our Sponsor and the private offering of Preferred Shares, each of which are described below.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P15_S0	On October 16, 2009, we sold 20,000 shares of our common stock to our Sponsor under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 at a price of $10.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $0.2 million, which was used to fund organizational costs.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P15_S1	On December 22, 2009, we commenced a private offering to accredited investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 of up to $50.0 million in shares of our 8% series A convertible preferred stock (the Preferred Shares ) subject to an option to increase the offering up to $100.0 million in Preferred Shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P15_S2	This private offering was terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the registration statement with respect to our common shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P15_S3	We had received aggregate gross offering proceeds, net of certain discounts, of approximately $17.0 million from the sale of approximately 2.0 million shares in this private offering.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P15_S4	The Preferred Shares were convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock after September 2, 2011, the first anniversary of the final closing of the private offering, at a conversion price of $9.00 per share (subject to discounts to a price not less than $8.50).

1474464_12_ITEM5_P19_S0	Total net offering proceeds received from the issuance of Preferred Shares, after deducting the total expenses paid as described above, were $13.9 million.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P19_S1	We used the net proceeds from this private offering to fund a portion of real estate acquisitions.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P19_S2	Use of Proceeds from Sales of Registered Securities On September 2, 2010, our Registration Statement covering a public offering of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock for up to $10.00 per share, for an aggregate offering price of up to $1.5 billion, was declared effective under the Securities Act.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P19_S3	The offering commenced on September 2, 2010 and is ongoing.

1474464_12_ITEM5_P22_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , offering proceeds from the sale of common stock exceeded cumulative offering costs by $33.2 million, due to the on-going nature of our offering process and that many expenses were paid before the offering commenced.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P22_S3	We will use the net proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering to purchase or fund real estate investments, including acquisition fees and closing costs.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P22_S4	Our common stock is currently not listed on a national securities exchange and we will not seek to list our stock until such time as our independent directors believe that the listing of our stock would be in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S0	In order to provide stockholders with the benefit of some interim liquidity, our board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program (the SRP ) that enables our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to significant conditions and limitations.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S1	Our Sponsor, Advisor, directors and affiliates are prohibited from receiving a fee on any share repurchases.

1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S4	In addition, we are only authorized to repurchase shares using the proceeds received from our DRIP and will limit the amount we spend to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the amount of proceeds we receive from our DRIP in that same quarter.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S5	Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S6	Unless the shares of our common stock are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below until we establish an estimated value of our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S7	We do not currently anticipate obtaining appraisals for our investments (other than investments in transactions with our Sponsor, Advisor, directors or their respective affiliates) and, accordingly, the estimated value of our investments should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S8	We expect to begin establishing an estimated value of our shares based on the value of our real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of our offering.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P23_S9	We will retain persons independent of us and our Advisor to prepare the estimated value of our shares.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P24_S0	Only those stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions may be able to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P24_S1	In other words, once our shares are transferred for value by a stockholder, the transferee and all subsequent holders of the shares are not eligible to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P25_S0	We will repurchase shares as of the last business day of each quarter (and in all events on a date other than a dividend payment date).
1474464_12_ITEM5_P25_S1	Prior to establishing the estimated value of our shares, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows:
1474464_12_ITEM5_P26_S0	the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least four years (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_12_ITEM5_P26_S1	Upon the death or disability of a stockholder, upon request, we will waive the one-year holding requirement.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P26_S2	Shares repurchased in connection with the death or disability of a stockholder will be repurchased at a purchase price equal to the price actually paid for the shares during the offering, or if not engaged in the offering, the per share purchase price will be based on the greater of $10.00 or the then-current net asset value of the shares as determined by our board of directors (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_12_ITEM5_P26_S3	In addition, we may waive the holding period in the event of a stockholder s bankruptcy or other exigent circumstances.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P26_S4	We did not repurchase any of our securities during the year ended December 31, 2011 , and we redeemed or accrued to redeem 2,538 shares for $25,000 due to the death of one stockholder at an average of $9.99 per share.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P27_S0	The share repurchase program immediately will terminate if our shares are listed on any national securities exchange.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P27_S1	In addition, our board of directors may amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM5_P27_S2	Further, our board of directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any requests for repurchases.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	Organization We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation and qualified as a real estate investment trust, ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	On September 2, 2010, we commenced our initial public offering ("IPO") on a reasonable best efforts basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-163069) (the Registration Statement ) filed with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our Registration Statement also covers up to 25.0 million shares available pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the DRIP ) under which our common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at the greater of $9.50 per share or 95% of the estimated value of a share of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , we had 6.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted shares of convertible preferred stock (the "Preferred Shares") and shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2011 , we had received total gross proceeds of $45.8 million from the sale of 4.6 million shares of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S5	In addition, we sold 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, which terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the Registration Statement.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S6	On December 15, 2011, we exercised our option to convert the Preferred Shares into 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2011 , the aggregate value of all common share issuances and subscriptions outstanding was $66.4 million based on a per share value of $10.00 (or $9.50 for shares issued under the DRIP).
1474464_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	We were formed to acquire high quality, income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	We purchased our first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2011 , we owned nine properties consisting of 148,933 rentable square feet, which were approximately 91.0% occupied on a weighted average basis with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.7 years.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "OP').
1474464_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	We are the sole general partner and holder of 99.01% of the units of the OP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	New York Recovery Advisors, LLC, our advisor (the Advisor ) is the sole limited partner and owner of a 0.99% non-controlling interest in our OP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	The limited partner interests may be exchanged for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of common stock or, at our option, a corresponding number of shares of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	The remaining rights of the limited partner interests are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP s assets.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	We retained our Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	New York Recovery Properties, LLC, an entity wholly owned by American Realty Capital III, LLC (the Sponsor ), serves as our property manager (the Property Manager ), unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S5	Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the Dealer Manager ), an affiliate of the Sponsor, serves as the dealer manager of our IPO.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S6	These related parties receive compensation and fees for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P3_S7	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include: Revenue Recognition Our revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	Investments in Real Estate Investments in real estate are recorded at cost.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to seven years for fixtures and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale on the balance sheet.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	Long-lived assets are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted or when they are designated as held for sale.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	Valuation of real estate is considered a critical accounting estimate because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value, and therefore, the carrying amounts of our real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P8_S4	Additionally, decisions regarding when a property should be classified as held for sale are also highly subjective and require significant management judgment.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P8_S5	Events or changes in circumstances that could cause an evaluation for impairment include the following:
1474464_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	We review our portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate the existence of any of the aforementioned events or changes in circumstances that would require us to test for recoverability.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	In general, our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value expected, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	We also estimate costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, we initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from two to 23 years.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended guidance to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	Specifically, the guidance revises two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarifies two others.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	It requires separate presentation of significant transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons for such transfers.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P23_S3	Also, it requires the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within Level 3 on a gross basis rather than on a net basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P23_S4	The amendments clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P23_S5	The adoption of the guidance related to Levels 1 and 2 were effective January 1, 2010, and did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P23_S6	The adoption of the guidance related to Level 3 was effective January 1, 2011, and did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	In December 2010, the FASB updated its guidance related to goodwill, which affected all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The guidance modifies Step 1 so that for those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance, which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	This guidance was effective on January 1, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	In December 2010, the FASB updated the guidance related to business combinations to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	The amendment specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P25_S6	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	The amendment affects any public entity, as defined, that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	This guidance was adopted for acquisitions occurring on or after January 1, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact upon our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	In May 2011, FASB issued guidance that expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, primarily for Level 3 measurements, which are measurements based on unobservable inputs such as our own data.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	This guidance is largely consistent with current fair value measurement principles with few exceptions that do not result in a change in general practice.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	The guidance will be applied prospectively and will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement - referred to as the statement of comprehensive income - or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The new guidance does not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	The guidance will be applied prospectively and will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain provisions of this guidance related to the presentation of certain reclassification adjustments of accumulated other comprehensive income, by component in both the statement of comprehensive income and the statement where the reclassification is presented.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations but will change the location of the presentation of other comprehensive income to more closely associate the disclosure with net income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative analysis as the first step in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative analysis for impairment is not required.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual impairment tests for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which contains new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of and entity's rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The new disclosures are designed to make financial statements prepared under GAAP more comparable to those prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards and will give the financial statement users information about both gross and net exposures.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

1474464_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Generally, capital needs for property acquisitions will be met through net proceeds received from the sale of common stock through our public offering and through property-level secured financings.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	We may also from time to time enter into other agreements with third parties whereby third parties will make equity investments in specific properties or groups of properties that we acquire.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Expenditures other than property acquisitions and acquisition and transaction-related costs are expected to be covered by cash flows from operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	We expect to meet our future short-term operating liquidity requirements through a combination of net cash provided by our current property operations and the operations of properties to be acquired in the future and proceeds from the sale of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	Management expects that in the future, as our portfolio matures, our properties will cover operating expenses and the payment of our monthly distribution.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from private offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	We expect to continue to raise capital through the sale of our common stock and to utilize the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and proceeds from secured financings to complete future property acquisitions.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	As of December 31, 2011 , we had 6.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted Preferred Shares and shares issued under the DRIP.

1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S12	Our Advisor evaluates potential acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets and engages in negotiations with sellers and borrowers on our behalf.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S13	Investors should be aware that after a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence and negotiation of final binding agreements.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S14	During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from common stock offerings in certain investments that could yield lower returns than the properties.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P42_S15	These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ("FFO"), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the "White Paper").
1474464_12_ITEM7_P44_S2	The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment writedowns, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P44_S3	Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P44_S4	Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s policy described above.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indications exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P45_S4	Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P45_S5	While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	However, FFO and MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT s definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	As disclosed in the prospectus for our offering (the Prospectus ), we will use the proceeds raised in the offering to acquire properties, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of the company or another similar transaction) within three to five years of the completion of the offering.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P49_S1	Thus, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association ( IPA ), an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P50_S3	By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our IPO has been completed and our properties have been acquired.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P50_S4	We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P50_S5	Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our IPO and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P50_S6	Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P51_S1	The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; nonrecurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P51_S2	The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, nonrecurring unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such non-recurring gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of on-going operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA s Practice Guideline described above.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P53_S1	In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P54_S1	These expenses are paid in cash, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P54_S2	All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are acquired and will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P54_S3	Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P54_S4	MFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activities and have similar operating characteristics.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P54_S5	Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P54_S6	In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non-recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized, and which are not reflective of on-going operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	As disclosed elsewhere in the Prospectus, the purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares in our offering, and therefore such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allows us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S2	For example, acquisition costs are funded from the proceeds of our IPO and other financing sources and not from operations.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S3	By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the properties.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S4	Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S5	By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S6	Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S7	Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P57_S8	FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no net asset value determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P58_S1	MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P58_S2	FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO or MFFO.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P58_S3	Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P58_S4	In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The table below reflects the items deducted or added to net income (loss) in our calculation of FFO and MFFO for the applicable periods during the year ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands).
1474464_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The table reflects MFFO in the IPA recommended format and MFFO without the straight-line rent adjustment which measure management also uses as a performance measure.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P59_S2	Items are presented net of non-controlling interest portions where applicable.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	______________________________ (1) The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	In evaluating investments in real estate, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P61_S1	Such information would be comparable only for non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P61_S2	By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or third parties.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S1	Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income and income from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S2	Such fees and expenses are paid in cash, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S3	Such fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S4	Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S5	All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S6	Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares our offering, and therefore such fees will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S7	(2) Under GAAP, certain intangibles are accounted for at cost and reviewed at least annually for impairment, and certain intangibles are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related assets that are excluded from FFO.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S8	However, because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, management believes that by excluding charges relating to amortization of these intangibles, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P62_S9	(3) Management believes that adjusting for mark-to-market adjustments is appropriate because they are nonrecurring items that may not be reflective of on-going operations and reflects unrealized impacts on value based only on then current market conditions, although they may be based upon current operational issues related to an individual property or industry or general market conditions.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The need to reflect mark-to-market adjustments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly and/or annual basis in accordance with GAAP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	(4) Under GAAP, rental receipts are allocated to periods using various methodologies.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than underlying contract terms.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	By adjusting for these items (to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments, providing insight on the contractual cash flows of such lease terms and debt investments, and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	Distributions On September 22, 2010, our board of directors declared a distribution rate equal to a 6.05% annualized rate based on the offering price of $10.00 per share of our common stock, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P65_S1	The distributions are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	In conjunction with the offering of the Preferred Shares, the board of directors declared, on a monthly basis, cumulative cash distributions at the rate of 8% per annum of the $9.00 liquidation preference per share (resulting in a distribution rate of 8.23% of the purchase price of the Preferred Shares if the purchase price was $8.75 and a distribution rate of 8.47% the purchase price of the Preferred Shares if the purchase price was $8.50).
1474464_12_ITEM7_P66_S1	The distribution on each of our shares is cumulative from the first date on which such share was issued and we aggregate and pay the distributions monthly in arrears on or about the first business day of each month.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P66_S2	On December 15, 2011, we exercised our option to convert the Preferred Shares into common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P66_S3	Therefore, as of December 31, 2011, there are no more Preferred Shares outstanding.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P66_S4	All distributions related to Preferred Shares have been paid as of December 31, 2011 and therefore no more distributions are owed to the former preferred stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P66_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , distributions paid to common and preferred stockholders totaled $2.4 million inclusive of approximately $0.4 million of the value of common stock issued under the DRIP.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P67_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P67_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2011 , cash used to pay our distributions was primarily generated from property operating results, the refinancing of our IDB property and the sale of shares of common stock.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P67_S3	We have continued to pay distributions to our stockholders each month since our initial distributions payment in April 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P67_S4	There is no assurance that we will continue to declare distributions at this rate.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	The following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to common and preferred stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	__________________ (1) Cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 included $1.6 million of acquisition and transaction related expenses.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P69_S1	Cash flows provided by or used in operations for the three months ended June 30, 2011, September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2011 included acquisition and transaction related expenses of $0.4 million, $46,000 and $1.1 million, respectively.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P69_S2	Cash flows during the three months ended December 31, 2011 also included interest expense of $0.8 million associated with defeasance fees related to the refinancing of the mortgage collateralized by our IDB property.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	(2) We refinanced the mortgage collateralized by our IDB property in November 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	We used the proceeds from the refinancing of $21.3 million to repay the remaining balance on the original mortgage of $13.8 million, pay defeasance fees of $0.8 million, partially fund the acquisition of our One Jackson Square property and to fund distributions during the three months ended December 31, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	The following table compares cumulative distributions paid to cumulative net loss (in accordance with GAAP) for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) through December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	__________________________________ (1) Net loss as defined by GAAP includes the non-cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense as well as costs incurred relating to acquisitions and related transactions.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Dilution Our net tangible book value per share is a mechanical calculation using amounts from our balance sheet, and is calculated as (1) total book value of our assets less the net value of intangible assets, (2) minus total liabilities less the net value of intangible liabilities, (3) divided by the total number of shares of common and preferred stock outstanding.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	It assumes that the value of real estate and real estate-related assets and liabilities diminish predictably over time as shown through the depreciation and amortization of real estate investments.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net tangible book value is used generally as a conservative measure of net worth that we do not believe reflects our estimated value per share.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	It is not intended to reflect the value of our assets upon an orderly liquidation in accordance with our investment objectives.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	Our net tangible book value reflects dilution in the value of our common and preferred stock from the issue price as a result of (i) operating losses, which reflect accumulated depreciation and amortization of real estate investments, (ii) the funding of distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, and (iii) fees paid in connection with IPO, including commissions, dealer manager fees and other offering costs.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , our net tangible book value per share was $6.49.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	The offering price of shares under our primary offering (ignoring purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers) at December 31, 2011 was $10.00.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P75_S5	Our offering price was not established on an independent basis and bears no relationship to the net value of our assets.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P75_S6	Further, even without depreciation in the value of our assets, the other factors described above with respect to the dilution in the value of our common stock are likely to cause our offering price to be higher than the amount you would receive per share if we were to liquidate at this time.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	The payment terms of our loan obligations require principal and interest amounts payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	Our loan agreements stipulate that we comply with specific reporting covenants.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	Our Advisor may, with the approval of our independent directors, seek to borrow short-term capital that, combined with secured mortgage financing, exceeds our targeted leverage ratio.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	Such short-term borrowings may be obtained from third parties on a case-by-case basis as acquisition opportunities present themselves simultaneous with our capital raising efforts.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	We view the use of short-term borrowings as an efficient and accretive means of acquiring real estate in advance of raising equity capital.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P77_S3	Accordingly, we can take advantage of buying opportunities as we expand our fundraising activities.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P77_S4	As additional equity capital is obtained, these short-term borrowings will be repaid.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P77_S5	Our leverage ratio approximated 60.6% (secured mortgage notes payable as a percentage of total real estate investments, at cost) as of December 31, 2011 .
1474464_12_ITEM7_P77_S6	The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	___________________________________ (1) The note holders had the option, but did not elect, to demand payment of 50% of the principal balance on July 15, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Election as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, and so long as we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	We believe we are organized and operated in such a manner as to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	Inflation Some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S4	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S5	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S6	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P80_S7	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Related-Party Transactions and Agreements We have entered into agreements with our Sponsor and its wholly owned affiliates whereby we pay certain fees or reimbursements to our Advisor or its affiliates in connection with acquisition and financing activities, sales of common and preferred stock, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering-related costs.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	See Note 11 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.
1474464_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , our debt included fixed-rate mortgage notes payable, with a carrying value of $ 75.3 million and a fair value of $75.2 million .
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate mortgages impact the fair value of the debt, but have no impact on interest incurred or cash flow.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed-rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2011 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $2.0 million.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $1.9 million.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S6	At December 31, 2011 , we do not have any variable-rate debt.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S7	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S8	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2011 , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P0_S9	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of such period, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act.
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	In connection with the preparation of our Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 .
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P0_S3	In making that assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2011 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P0_S5	The rules of the SEC do not require, and this annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding, internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1474464_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

1474464_12_ITEM15_P7_S7	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P7_S8	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1474464_12_ITEM15_P22_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
1474464_12_ITEM15_P23_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P24_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P24_S1	All inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P25_S0	In determining whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P26_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P26_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P27_S0	Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, and derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, as applicable.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	Real Estate Investments Investments in real estate are recorded at cost.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P28_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P28_S2	Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to 15 years for fixtures and capital improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P30_S0	The Company is required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P30_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as held for sale on the balance sheet.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P31_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P31_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P31_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P33_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Assets The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P33_S1	Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P33_S2	The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P33_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P33_S4	Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third-parties or the Company s analysis of comparable properties in its portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P33_S5	Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P35_S3	Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P37_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P37_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on the Company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and its overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P38_S1	Characteristics considered in determining these values include the nature and extent of the existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from 2 to 23 years.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P40_S1	The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P40_S2	Intangible assets and acquired lease liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	The following table provides the weighted-average amortization and accretion periods as of December 31, 2011 for intangible assets and liabilities and the projected amortization expense for the next five years (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company deposits cash with high quality financial institutions.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P43_S2	These deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company up to an insurance limit.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P43_S3	At December 31, 2011 the Company had deposits of $10.2 million of which $9.0 million were in excess of the amount insured by the FDIC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P43_S4	Although the Company bears risk to amounts in excess of those insured by the FDIC, it does not anticipate any losses as a result.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves related to lease expirations as well as maintenance, structural, and debt service reserves as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 .

1474464_12_ITEM15_P44_S3	These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P44_S4	Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P44_S5	Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.

1474464_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	Share Repurchase Program The Company s board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program ( SRP ) that enables stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in limited circumstances.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P46_S1	The SRP permits investors to sell their shares back to the Company after they have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described below.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P46_S2	Prior to the time that the Company s shares are listed on a national securities exchange and until the Company establishes an estimated value for the shares, the purchase price per share will depend on the length of time investors have held such shares as follows: after one year from the purchase date the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after two years from the purchase date the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after three years from the purchase date the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; and after four years from the purchase date the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the amount they actually paid for each share (in each case, as adjusted for any stock distributions, combinations, splits and recapitalizations).
1474464_12_ITEM15_P46_S3	The Company expects to begin establishing an estimated value for its shares based on the value of its real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of its offering.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P47_S0	Beginning 18 months after the completion of the last offering of the Company s shares (excluding offerings under the DRIP), the board of directors will determine the value of the properties and the other assets based on such information as the board determines appropriate, which may or may not include independent valuations of properties or of the Company as a whole.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P48_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company is only authorized to repurchase shares using the proceeds received from the distribution reinvestment plan and will limit the amount spent to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the amount of proceeds received from the DRIP in that same quarter.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P49_S1	In addition, the board of directors may reject a request for redemption, at any time.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P49_S2	Due to these limitations, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P49_S3	Purchases under the SRP by the Company will be limited in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior year.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	When a stockholder requests redemption and the redemption is approved by the Company's board of directors, it will reclassify such obligation from equity to a liability based on the settlement value of the obligation.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	As of December 31, 2011 there were 2,538 shares with a value of $25,000 redeemed or accrued to be redeemed due to the death of the stockholders.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	There were no redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1474464_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	Distribution Reinvestment Plan Pursuant to the DRIP, stockholders may elect to reinvest distributions by purchasing shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P52_S1	No dealer manager fees or selling commissions are paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P52_S2	Participants purchasing shares pursuant to the DRIP have the same rights and are treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the IPO.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	The board of directors may designate that certain cash or other distributions be excluded from the DRIP.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company has the right to amend any aspect of the DRIP or terminate the DRIP with ten days notice to participants.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	Shares issued under the DRIP are recorded to equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the period distributions are declared.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P53_S3	There were 44,117 shares issued under the DRIP during the year ended December 31, 2011 with a value of $419,000 .
1474464_12_ITEM15_P53_S4	There were no shares issued under the DRIP during the year ended December 31, 2010 or the period from October 6, 2009 to December 31, 2009 .
1474464_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	Derivative Instruments The Company may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company s operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P58_S1	The accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P58_S2	If the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P58_S3	If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P58_S4	Any ineffective portion of a derivative's cange in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company s revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	Since many of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	When the Company acquires a property, the term of existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in the consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	Organization, Offering, and Related Costs Organization and offering costs (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) of the Company may be paid by the Advisor, the Dealer Manager or their affiliates on behalf of the Company.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	Such organization and offering costs include all expenses to be paid by the Company in connection with its offering, including but not limited to (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing, and filing fees; (ii) escrow related fees; (iii) reimbursement of the Dealer Manager for amounts it may pay to reimburse the bona fide diligence expenses of broker-dealers; and (iv) reimbursement to the Advisor for the salaries of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and related offering activities.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	The Company is obligated to reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for organization and offering costs paid by them on behalf of the Company, provided that the Advisor is obligated to reimburse the Company to the extent organization and offering costs (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) incurred by the Company in its offering exceed 1.5% of gross offering proceeds.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P63_S3	As a result, these costs are only a liability of the Company to the extent selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs do not exceed 11.5% of the gross proceeds determined at the end of offering (See Note 11 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements).
1474464_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company has a stock-based incentive award plan for its directors, which is accounted for under the guidance of share based payments.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	The expense for such awards is included in general and administrative expenses and is recognized over the vesting period or when the requirements for exercise of the award have been met.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	Income Taxes The Company made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P65_S1	If the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income to its stockholders, and so long as it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Per Share Data Income (loss) per basic share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) less distributions declared on Preferred Shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P67_S1	Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments, such as stock options and unvested restricted stock, but uses the average share price for the period in determining the number of incremental shares that are to be added to the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Reportable Segments The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company s investments in real estate generate rental revenue and other income through the leasing of properties, which comprised 100% of total consolidated revenues.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Management evaluates the operating performance of the Company s investments in real estate on an individual property level.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended guidance to require a number of additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	Specifically, the guidance revises two disclosure requirements concerning fair value measurements and clarifies two others.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P71_S2	It requires separate presentation of significant transactions into and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and disclosure of the reasons fort such transfers.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P71_S3	Also, it requires the presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within level 3 on a gross basis rather than on a net basis.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P71_S4	The amendments clarify that disclosures should be disaggregated by class of asset or liability and that disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques should be provided for both recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P71_S5	The adoption of the guidance related to Levels 1 and 2 were effective January 1, 2010, and did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P71_S6	The adoption of the guidance related to Level 3 was effective January 1, 2011, and did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	In December 2010, the FASB updated its guidance related to goodwill which affected all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	The guidance modifies Step 1 so that for those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	The qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance, which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	This guidance was adopted on January 1, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P73_S3	The adoption of this guidance did have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P73_S4	In December 2010, the FASB updated the guidance related to business combinations to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P73_S5	The amendment specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P73_S6	The amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	The amendment affects any public entity, as defined, that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	This guidance was adopted for acquisitions occurring on or after January 1, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact upon the Company's financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued guidance that expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, primarily for Level 3 measurements, which are measurements based on unobservable inputs such as the Company's own data.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P75_S1	This guidance is largely consistent with current fair value measurement principles with few exceptions that do not result in a change in general practice.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P75_S2	The guidance will be applied prospectively and will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P75_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations as the guidance relates only to disclosure requirements.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement - referred to as the statement of comprehensive income - or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	The new guidance does not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P76_S2	The guidance will be applied prospectively and will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P76_S3	In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain provisions of this guidance related to the presentation of certain reclassification adjustments of accumulated other comprehensive income, by component in both the statement of comprehensive income and the statement where the reclassification is presented.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P76_S4	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations but will change the location of the presentation of other comprehensive income to more closely associate the disclosure with net income.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative analysis as the first step in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P77_S1	If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative analysis for impairment is not required.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P77_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual impairment tests for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P77_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P78_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P79_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance which contains new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of and entity's rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P79_S1	The new disclosures are designed to make financial statements prepared under GAAP more comparable to those prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards and will give the financial statement users information about both gross and net exposures.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P79_S2	The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P79_S3	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

1474464_12_ITEM15_P94_S3	In connection with the defeasance, the Company incurred $0.8 million in defeasance fees and the write-off of deferred financing costs, which is included in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_12_ITEM15_P94_S4	(2) The mortgage was guaranteed by an affiliate, American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., until such time as the Company reaches a net worth of $40.0 million.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P94_S5	This affiliate has as a non-controlling interest in Bleecker Street through its initial investment of $12.0 million in connection with the purchase of this portfolio.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P94_S6	Thereafter, this minimum net worth must be maintained by the Company to remain in compliance with the debt covenants under the mortgage agreement.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P94_S7	The Company's net worth exceeded $40.0 million in October 2011 and therefore, the affiliate no longer guarantees this mortgage obligation.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P94_S8	(3) Fixed through an interest rate swap agreement.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P94_S9	(4) Calculated on a weighted average basis.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company s sources of secured financing generally require financial covenants, including restrictions on corporate guarantees, the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of minimum net worth.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company was in compliance with the debt covenants under the mortgage note agreements.

1474464_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	Note 6 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P97_S1	This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P98_S0	The guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P98_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P98_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P99_S0	The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P99_S1	In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P99_S2	The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P99_S3	However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P99_S4	Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P99_S5	However, as of December 31, 2011 , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company s derivatives.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P99_S6	As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P100_S0	The valuation of derivative instruments is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P100_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P100_S2	In addition, credit valuation adjustments, are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company s potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the counterparties.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P101_S0	The following table presents information about the Company s liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P101_S1	The Company had no derivatives at December 31, 2010.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P102_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P103_S1	The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other receivables, due to affiliates, notes payable, accounts payable and distributions payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheet due to their short-term nature.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P103_S2	The fair values of the Company s financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet are reported below (in thousands):
1474464_12_ITEM15_P104_S0	The fair value of the mortgage notes payable are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Advisor's experience with similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P105_S0	Note 7 Derivatives and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P105_S1	The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company s operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P105_S2	The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative or other purposes other than interest rate risk management.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P105_S3	The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P105_S4	To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P105_S5	The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P106_S0	Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P106_S1	To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P107_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P107_S1	Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the floor strike rate on the contract.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P107_S2	Derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with forecasted variable-rate debt.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P107_S3	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P107_S4	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P107_S5	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s variable-rate debt.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P107_S6	During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional $0.1 million will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P108_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivative that was designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P108_S1	This derivative relates to an interest rate swap agreement to fix the variable-rate mortgage secured by the retail condominium units at One Jackson Square.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P108_S2	The Company did not have any derivative agreements as of December 31, 2010.

1474464_12_ITEM15_P110_S0	Non-Designated Hedges Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P110_S1	These derivatives are used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements to be classified as hedging instruments.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P110_S2	The Company does not have any hedging instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P110_S3	The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 .

1474464_12_ITEM15_P114_S0	Credit-risk-related Contingent Features The Company has an agreement with its derivative counterparty that contains a provision where by the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligation.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P114_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the fair value of derivatives in a liability position related to this agreement was $0.2 million .
1474464_12_ITEM15_P114_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company has not posted any collateral related to this agreement and was not in breach of any agreement provisions.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P114_S3	If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreement at its aggregate termination value of $0.2 million at December 31, 2011 .
1474464_12_ITEM15_P115_S0	In December 2009, the Company commenced its Preferred Offering to qualified investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P115_S1	The Company sold approximately 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P115_S2	Upon the commencement of the Company s IPO on September 2, 2010 the Preferred Offering was terminated (the Final Closing ).
1474464_12_ITEM15_P115_S3	The Preferred Shares ranked senior to all other shares of the Company s capital stock, including its common stock, with respect to dividends and payments and distribution of assets upon liquidation.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P115_S4	The Preferred Shares were convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock at any time and from time to time after September 2, 2011, the first anniversary of the Final Closing, at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis (as adjusted for any stock split, stock combination, reverse stock split, reclassification or similar transaction).
1474464_12_ITEM15_P116_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P117_S0	Redemption or Conversion at the Option of the Company.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S0	At the option of the Company, any time after September 2, 2011, the one year anniversary of the Final Closing, (i) the Preferred Shares were redeemable, in whole or in part, for cash at a redemption price equal to the purchase price paid by a holder plus accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the date of redemption, and/or (ii) the Company could require that the Preferred Shares be converted, in whole or in part, into common stock on a one-for-one basis (and would pay the holder an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends to and including the date of conversion on the Preferred Shares converted).
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S1	If the Company called the Preferred Shares for redemption for cash, the holders would have the option to convert the Preferred Shares into common stock at any time prior to the redemption date.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S2	On December 15, 2011, the Company converted all Preferred Shares to common shares on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S3	Therefore, as of December 31, 2011 , there were no Preferred Shares outstanding.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S4	The Preferred Shares had a liquidation preference of $9.00 per Preferred Share regardless of the purchase price paid.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S5	From the date an investor was issued Preferred Shares, the Company been paying cumulative dividends on the Preferred Shares monthly in arrears at the annualized rate of 8.00% on the liquidation preference (resulting in a dividend rate of 8.23% of the purchase price if the purchase price was $8.75 and a dividend rate of 8.47% of the purchase price if the purchase price was $8.50).
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S6	Because the terms of the Preferred Shares allowed the Company to either convert the shares to common stock at a fixed-rate or redeem the shares for cash, also at a fixed amount, and the holder of the Preferred Shares only had the right to convert the Preferred Shares to common stock at a fixed redemption rate and did not, except in the case of death or disability of the holder, have the right to redeem the stock for cash, the Preferred Shares were included as a separate component of equity in the Company s balance sheet.
1474464_12_ITEM15_P118_S7	The Company s obligation to redeem any of the Preferred Shares was limited to the extent that the Company has sufficient funds available as determined by the Company s board of directors.

1474464_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	continue to build and expand our operations structure to support our business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We cannot guarantee that we will succeed in achieving these goals, and our failure to do so could cause you to lose all or a portion of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	You may be more likely to sustain a loss on your investment because our Sponsor does not have as strong an economic incentive to avoid losses as does a sponsor who has made significant equity investments in its company.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our Sponsor has only invested $0.2 million in us through the purchase of 20,000 shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Therefore, since we have been successful in raising enough proceeds to be able to reimburse our Sponsor for our significant offering expenses, our Sponsor will have little exposure to loss in the value of our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Without this exposure, our investors may be at a greater risk of loss because our Sponsor may have less to lose from a decrease in the value of our shares than would a sponsor that makes more significant equity investments in its company.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	There is no public trading market for our shares and there may never be one; therefore, it will be difficult for you to sell your shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	There currently is no public market for our shares and there may never be one.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If you are able to find a buyer for your shares, you may not sell your shares unless the buyer meets applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards and the sale does not violate state securities laws.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our charter also prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock by a single investor, unless exempted by our board of directors, which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase your shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Moreover, our share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that would limit your ability to sell your shares to us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our board of directors may reject any request for redemption of shares, or amend, suspend or terminate our share repurchase program upon 30 days' notice.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Therefore, it will be difficult for you to sell your shares promptly or at all.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S7	If you are able to sell your shares, you likely will have to sell them at a substantial discount to the price you paid for the shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S8	It also is likely that your shares would not be accepted as the primary collateral for a loan.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S9	You should purchase the shares only as a long-term investment because of the illiquid nature of the shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S10	If we, through our Advisor, are unable to find suitable investments, then we may not be able to achieve our investment objectives or pay distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S11	Our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions is dependent upon the performance of our Advisor in acquiring our investments, selecting tenants for our properties and securing independent financing arrangements.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S12	We currently own only 16 properties and we have identified only one other property to acquire and do not have any other investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S13	Except for those investments described herein and those investors who purchase shares in our offering after such time as our prospectus is supplemented to describe one or more additional investments which have been identified, you will have no opportunity to evaluate the terms of transactions or other economic or financial data concerning our investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S14	You must rely entirely on the management ability of our Advisor and the oversight of our board of directors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P4_S15	We cannot be sure that our Advisor will be successful in obtaining suitable investments on financially attractive terms or that, if it makes investments on our behalf, our objectives will be achieved.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We may suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We could suffer from delays in locating suitable investments, particularly as a result of our reliance on our Advisor at times when management of our Advisor is simultaneously seeking to locate suitable investments for other affiliated programs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Delays we encounter in the selection and acquisition of income-producing properties (and, if we develop properties, development of income-producing properties) likely would adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your overall returns.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In such event, we may pay all or a substantial portion of our distributions from the proceeds of our offering or from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow, which may constitute a return of your capital.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from our offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Distributions from the proceeds of our offering or from borrowings also could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	This, in turn, would reduce the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	In particular, where we acquire properties prior to the start of construction or during the early stages of construction, it typically will take several months to complete construction and rent available space.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Therefore, you could suffer delays in the receipt of cash distributions attributable to those particular properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S9	If our Advisor is unable to obtain further suitable investments, we will hold the uninvested proceeds of our offering in an interest-bearing account or invest the proceeds in short-term, investment-grade investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P5_S10	If we cannot invest the uninvested proceeds from our offering within a reasonable amount of time, or if our board of directors determines it is in the best interests of our stockholders, we will return the uninvested proceeds to investors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our properties may be adversely affected by the current economic downturn, as well as economic cycles and risks inherent to the New York MSA, especially New York City.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We expect to use substantially all the net proceeds of our offering to acquire quality income-producing commercial real estate located predominantly in New York City and elsewhere in the New York MSA.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the New York MSA, including a continuation or worsening of the current economic downturn, would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this markets in both the short and long term.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in the New York MSA could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The factors affecting economic conditions in the New York MSA include:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In addition, since rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions, our office properties located in the New York MSA may be adversely affected during periods of diminished economic growth and a decline in white-collar employment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for over three years.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	A protracted economic downturn could have a negative impact on our portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If real property or other real estate related asset values continue to decline after we acquire them, we may have a difficult time making new acquisitions or generating returns on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If the current debt market environment persists, we may modify our investment strategy in order to optimize our portfolio performance.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our options would include limiting or eliminating the use of debt and focusing on those investments that do not require the use of leverage to meet our portfolio goals.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	It is impossible for us to assess with certainty the future effects of the current adverse trends in the economic and investment climates of the geographic area in which we concentrate, and more generally of the United States, or the real estate markets in this area.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If the current economic downturn persists or if there is any further local, national or global worsening of the current economic downturn, our businesses and future profitability will be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Because our properties will be located primarily in New York City, our portfolio may be concentrated in properties of substantial size.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	We anticipate having significant investments in the New York MSA, primarily in New York City, where individual property values may be substantially higher than in other geographic areas in the United States or abroad.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We may acquire one or more individual properties with high acquisition costs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	As a result, our portfolio may be concentrated in few properties of substantial size.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the New York MSA would have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Terrorist attacks, such as those of September 11, 2001 in New York City, may adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to generate cash flow.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We anticipate having significant investments in the New York MSA, primarily in New York City.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S7	In the aftermath of a terrorist attack, tenants in these areas may choose to relocate their businesses to less populated, lower-profile areas of the United States that may be perceived to be less likely targets of future terrorist activity and fewer customers may choose to patronize businesses in these areas.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S8	This in turn would trigger a decrease in the demand for space in these areas, which could increase vacancies in our properties and force us to lease space on less favorable terms.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S9	As a result, the value of our properties and the level of our revenues and cash flows could decline materially.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S10	If we are unable to raise substantial funds, we will be limited in the number and type of investments we may make and the value of your investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific properties we acquire.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S11	Our offering is being made on a best efforts basis, whereby the Dealer Manager is only required to use its best efforts to sell our shares and has no firm commitment or obligation to purchase any of the shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S12	As a result, the amount of proceeds we raise in our offering may be substantially less than the amount we would need to achieve a broadly diversified property portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S13	If we are unable to raise substantial proceeds, we will make fewer investments, resulting in less diversification in terms of the number of investments owned, the geographic regions in which our investments are located and the types of investments that we make.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S14	In such event, the likelihood of our profitability being affected by the performance of any one of our investments will increase.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S15	Additionally, we are not limited in the number or size of our investments or the percentage of net proceeds we may dedicate to a single investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S16	Your investment in our shares will be subject to greater risk to the extent that we lack a diversified portfolio of investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S17	In addition, our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, and our financial condition and ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S18	If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain key personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions and the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S19	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain of our executive officers and other key personnel of our Advisor, including Nicholas S. Schorsch and Edward M. Weil, Jr., each of whom would be difficult to replace.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S20	Our Advisor does not have an employment agreement with any of these key personnel and we cannot guarantee that all, or any particular one, will remain affiliated with us or our Advisor.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S21	If any of our key personnel were to cease their affiliation with our Advisor, our operating results could suffer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S22	Further, we do not intend to separately maintain key person life insurance on Messrs. Schorsch or Weil or any other person.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S23	We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our Advisor's ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial, operational and marketing personnel.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S24	Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that our Advisor will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P11_S25	If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain the services of key personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered, and the value of your investment may decline.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We may be unable to pay or maintain distributions from cash available from operations or increase distributions over time.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	There are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash distributions to stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The amount of cash available from our operations for distributions is affected by many factors, such as our ability to buy properties as offering proceeds become available, rental income from such properties and our operating expense levels, as well as many other variables.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Actual cash available for distributions may vary substantially from estimates.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	With limited prior operating history, we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay or maintain our current level of distributions or that distributions will increase over time.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We cannot give any assurance that rents from the properties will increase, that the securities we buy will increase in value or provide constant or increased distributions over time, or that future acquisitions of real properties, mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or any investments in securities will increase our cash available for distributions to stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Our actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used by our board of directors in establishing the distribution rate to stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We may not have sufficient cash from operations to make a distribution required to qualify for or maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We may pay distributions from unlimited amounts of any source.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S8	For example, we may borrow money or use proceeds from our offering to make distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Any such distributions will constitute a return of capital and may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in properties and negatively impact the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S10	In addition, we may issue additional securities or sell assets to fund distribution payments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Distributions paid from sources other than our cash flows from operations, particularly from proceeds of our IPO, will result in us having fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties and other real estate-related investments and may dilute your interests in us, which may adversely affect our ability to fund future distributions with cash flows from operations and may adversely affect your overall return.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S12	Our cash flows provided by operations of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 was a shortfall of $3.7 million, or 54.8%, to our distributions paid of $6.7 million (inclusive of $3.3 million of common stock issued under the DRIP) during such period.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S13	Such shortfall was paid from proceeds from common stock issued under the DRIP and proceeds from financings from our revolving credit facility.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S14	Additionally, we may in the future pay distributions from sources other than from our cash flows from operations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S15	Until we acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments, we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to pay distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S16	Our inability to acquire additional properties or other real estate-related investments may result in a lower return on your investment than you expect.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S17	If we have not generated sufficient cash flows from our operations and other sources, such as our Advisor's deferral or suspension or waiver of its fees and expense reimbursements, to fund distributions, we may use the proceeds from our IPO, from borrowings or from the sale of additional securities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S18	Moreover, our board of directors may change our distribution policy, in its sole discretion, at any time.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S19	Distributions made from offering proceeds are a return of capital to stockholders, from which we will have already paid offering expenses in connection with our IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S20	We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from our IPO that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S21	If we fund distributions from the proceeds of our IPO, we will have less funds available for acquiring properties or other real estate-related investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S22	As a result, the return you realize on your investment may be reduced.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S23	Funding distributions from borrowings could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments, which may affect our profitability.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S24	Funding distributions with the sale of assets or the proceeds of our IPO may affect our ability to generate cash flows.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S25	Funding distributions from the sale of additional securities could dilute your interest in us if we sell shares of our common stock or securities convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock to third-party investors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P13_S26	Payment of distributions from the mentioned sources could restrict our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, affect our profitability or affect the distributions payable to you upon a liquidity event, any or all of which may have an adverse effect on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers, directors and our Advisor are limited, which could reduce your and our recovery against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation's best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors, officers and Advisor and our Advisor's affiliates and permits us to indemnify our employees and agents.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	However, as required by the NASAA REIT Guidelines, our charter provides that we may not indemnify a director, our Advisor or an affiliate of our Advisor for any loss or liability suffered by any of them or hold harmless such indemnitee for any loss or liability suffered by us unless (1) the indemnitee determined, in good faith, that the course of conduct that caused the loss or liability was in our best interests, (2) the indemnitee was acting on behalf of or performing services for us, (3) the liability or loss was not the result of (A) negligence or misconduct, in the case of a director (other than an independent director), the Advisor or an affiliate of the Advisor, or (B) gross negligence or willful misconduct, in the case of an independent director, and (4) the indemnification or agreement to hold harmless is recoverable only out of our net assets and not from our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Although our charter does not allow us to indemnify or hold harmless an indemnitee to a greater extent than permitted under Maryland law and the NASAA REIT Guidelines, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors, officers, employees and agents, and our Advisor and its affiliates, than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce your and our recovery against them.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents or our Advisor and its affiliates in some cases which would decrease the cash otherwise available for distribution to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We rely significantly on one major tenant and therefore, are subject to tenant credit concentrations that make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to that tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	From time to time, one or more of our tenants (including, for this purpose, all affiliates thereof) may account for 5% or more of our annualized rental income on a straight-line basis.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	American Language Communication Center, Inc. represented 13.5% of our annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The financial failure of a major tenant is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, the value of our investment in a real estate asset is historically driven by the credit quality of the underlying tenant, and an adverse change in a major tenant's financial condition or a decline in the credit rating of such tenant may result in a decline in the value of our investments and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationships with our Advisor and its affiliates, including the material conflicts discussed below.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The management of multiple REITs, especially REITs in the development stage, by our executive officers and officers of our Advisor may significantly reduce the amount of time our executive officers and officers of our Advisor are able to spend on activities related to us and may cause other conflicts of interest, which may cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our executive officers and officers of our Advisor are part of the senior management or are key personnel of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs and their advisors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Four of the American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs, including American Realty Capital Global Trust, Inc., American Realty Capital Trust IV, Inc., ARC Realty Finance Trust, Inc. and American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust II, Inc., have registration statements that became effective in the past 12 months and currently are offering securities and none of the American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs are more than five years old.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As a result, such REITs will have concurrent and/or overlapping fundraising, acquisition, operational and disposition and liquidation phases as us, which may cause conflicts of interest to arise throughout the life of our company with respect to, among other things, finding investors, locating and acquiring properties, entering into leases and disposing of properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The conflicts of interest each of our executive officers and each officer of our Advisor will face may delay our fund raising and investment of our proceeds due to the competing time demands and generally cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Officers of any service provider may face similar conflicts of interest should they be involved with the management of multiple REITs, and especially REITs in the developmental stage.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We will compete for investors with other programs of our Sponsor, which could adversely affect the amount of capital we have to invest.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The American Realty Capital group of companies is currently the sponsor of eight other public offerings of non-traded REIT shares, the majority of which will be ongoing during a significant portion of our offering period.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	These programs all have filed registration statements for the offering of common stock and either are or intend to elect to be taxed as REITs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	These offerings are taking place concurrently with our offering, and our Sponsor is likely to sponsor other offerings during our offering period.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Our Dealer Manager is the dealer manager for these other offerings.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Additionally, our Sponsor is the sponsor of ARCP, which is a REIT that is actively traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, which may conduct one or more offerings during our offering period.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S6	We will compete for investors with these other programs, and the overlap of these offerings with our offering could adversely affect our ability to raise all the capital we seek in this offering, the timing of sales of our shares and the amount of proceeds we have to spend on real estate investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Our Advisor faces conflicts of interest relating to the purchase and leasing of properties, and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect our investment opportunities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Affiliates of our Advisor have sponsored and may sponsor one or more other real estate investment programs in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We may buy properties at the same time as one or more of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs managed by officers and key personnel of our Advisor.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	There is a risk that our Advisor will choose a property that provides lower returns to us than a property purchased by another American Realty Capital-sponsored program.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	We cannot be sure that officers and key personnel acting on behalf of our Advisor and on behalf of managers of other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs will act in our best interests when deciding whether to allocate any particular property to us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, we may acquire properties in geographic areas where other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs own properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Also, we may acquire properties from, or sell properties to, other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If one of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs attracts a tenant that we are competing for, we could suffer a loss of revenue due to delays in locating another suitable tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S7	You will not have the opportunity to evaluate the manner in which these conflicts of interest are resolved before or after making your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Similar conflicts of interest may apply if our Advisor determines to make or purchase mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or participations therein on our behalf, since other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs may be competing with us for these investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Our Advisor faces conflicts of interest relating to joint ventures, which could result in a disproportionate benefit to the other venture partners at our expense.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We may enter into joint ventures with other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our Advisor may have conflicts of interest in determining which American Realty Capital-sponsored program should enter into any particular joint venture agreement.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals that are or may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, our Advisor may face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interest of the affiliated co-venturer and in managing the joint venture.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Since our Advisor and its affiliates will control both the affiliated co-venturer and, to a certain extent, us, agreements and transactions between the co-venturers with respect to any such joint venture will not have the benefit of arm's-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers, which may result in the co-venturer receiving benefits greater than the benefits that we receive.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, we may assume liabilities related to the joint venture that exceeds the percentage of our investment in the joint venture.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Our Advisor and its officers and employees and certain of our key personnel face competing demands relating to their time, and this may cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our Advisor and its officers and employees and certain of our key personnel and their respective affiliates are key personnel, general partners and sponsors of other real estate programs having investment objectives and legal and financial obligations similar to ours and may have other business interests as well.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Because these persons have competing demands on their time and resources, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our business and these other activities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If this occurs, the returns on our investments may suffer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our officers and directors face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with affiliated entities, which could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to generate returns to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Certain of our executive officers, including Nicholas S. Schorsch, who also serves as the chairman of our board of directors, and Edward M. Weil, Jr., president, chief operating officer and secretary, also are officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager, our Dealer Manager and other affiliated entities, including the other real estate programs sponsored by ARC.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Their loyalties to these other entities could result in actions or inactions that are detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our investment and leasing opportunities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of new investments and management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) our purchase of properties from, or sale of properties, to affiliated entities, (c) the timing and terms of the investment in or sale of an asset, (d) development of our properties by affiliates, (e) investments with affiliates of our Advisor, (f) compensation to our Advisor, and (g) our relationship with our Dealer Manager and Property Manager.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, we may be unable to generate cash needed to make distributions to you and to maintain or increase the value of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S5	There is no separate counsel for us and our affiliates, which could result in conflicts of interest.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Proskauer Rose LLP acts as legal counsel to us and also represents our Advisor and some of its affiliates.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S7	There is a possibility in the future that the interests of the various parties may become adverse and, under the Code of Professional Responsibility of the legal profession, Proskauer Rose LLP may be precluded from representing any one or all such parties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S8	If any situation arises in which our interests appear to be in conflict with those of our Advisor or its affiliates, additional counsel may be retained by one or more of the parties to assure that their interests are adequately protected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S9	Moreover, should a conflict of interest not be readily apparent, Proskauer Rose LLP may inadvertently act in derogation of the interest of the parties which could affect our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S10	Our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to our incentive fee structure, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S11	Under our advisory agreement and the partnership agreement of the OP (the "Partnership Agreement") our Advisor or its affiliates, including New York Recovery Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the "Special Limited Partner") will be entitled to fees and distributions that are structured in a manner intended to provide incentives to our Advisor to perform in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S12	However, because our Advisor does not maintain a significant equity interest in us and is entitled to receive substantial minimum compensation regardless of performance, our Advisor's interests are not wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S13	In that regard, our Advisor could be motivated to recommend riskier or more speculative investments in order for us to generate the specified levels of performance or sales proceeds that would entitle our Advisor to fees.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P23_S14	In addition, our Advisor's and its assignees' entitlement to fees upon the sale of our assets and to participate in sale proceeds could result in our Advisor recommending sales of our investments at the earliest possible time at which sales of investments would produce the level of return that would entitle the Advisor to compensation relating to such sales, even if continued ownership of those investments might be in our best long-term interest.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Partnership Agreement requires us to pay a performance-based termination fee to the Special Limited Partner if we terminate the advisory agreement prior to the listing of our shares for trading on an exchange or, absent such termination, in respect of its participation in net sales proceeds.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	To avoid paying this fee, our independent directors may decide against terminating the advisory agreement prior to our listing of our shares or disposition of our investments even if, but for the termination fee, termination of the advisory agreement would be in our best interest.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In addition, the requirement to pay the fee to the Advisor or its affiliates at termination could cause us to make different investment or disposition decisions than we would otherwise make, in order to satisfy our obligation to pay the fee to the terminated Advisor.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Moreover, our Advisor will have the right to terminate the advisory agreement upon a change of control of our company and thereby trigger the payment of the termination fee, which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing the change of control.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We disclose modified funds from operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, including in documents filed with the SEC; however, modified fund from operations is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and you should consider GAAP measures to be more relevant to our operating performance.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We use and disclose to investors modified funds from operations ("MFFO"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined in accordance with GAAP, and investors should consider GAAP measures to be more relevant to evaluating our operating performance.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	MFFO and GAAP net income differ because MFFO excludes gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write-downs, and adds back depreciation and amortization, adjusts for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, and further excludes acquisition-related expenses, amortization of above- and below-market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Because of the differences between MFFO and GAAP net income or loss, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which we are acquiring properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, MFFO is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and investors should not consider MFFO as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or as indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate MFFO.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Also, because not all companies calculate MFFO the same way, comparisons with other companies may not be meaningful.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Our charter permits our board of directors to issue stock with terms that may subordinate the rights of common stockholders or discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Our charter permits our board of directors to issue up to 350.0 million shares of stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, our board of directors, without any action by our stockholders, may amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series of stock that we have authority to issue.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S5	Our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S6	Thus, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have a priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P30_S7	Preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may limit your ability to exit the investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P31_S2	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has exempted any business combination involving our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	As a result, our Advisor and any affiliate of our Advisor may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P38_S4	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	"Control shares" are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of control shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or by-laws of the corporation.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Our by-laws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P40_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Your investment return may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The company is not registered, and does not intend to register itself or any of its subsidiaries, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	If we become obligated to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company, the registered entity would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act imposing, among other things:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The company intends to conduct its operations, directly and through wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, so that the company and each of its subsidiaries are exempt from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an "investment company" if it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Since we will be primarily engaged in the business of acquiring real estate, we believe that the company and most, if not all, of its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries will not be considered investment companies under either Section 3(a)(1)(A) or Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If the company or any of its wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries would ever inadvertently fall within one of the definitions of "investment company," we intend to rely on the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Under Section 3(c)(5)(C), the SEC staff generally requires a company to maintain at least 55% of its assets directly in qualifying assets and at least 80% of the entity's assets in qualifying assets and in a broader category of real estate related assets to qualify for this exception.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Mortgage-related securities may or may not constitute such qualifying assets, depending on the characteristics of the mortgage-related securities, including the rights that we have with respect to the underlying loans.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	The company's ownership of mortgage-related securities, therefore, is limited by provisions of the Investment Company Act and SEC staff interpretations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The method we use to classify our assets for purposes of the Investment Company Act will be based in large measure upon no-action positions taken by the SEC staff in the past.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	These no-action positions were issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may face, and a number of these no-action positions were issued more than twenty years ago.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	No assurance can be given that the SEC staff will concur with our classification of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, the SEC staff may, in the future, issue further guidance that may require us to re-classify our assets for purposes of qualifying for an exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If we are required to re-classify our assets, we may no longer be in compliance with the exclusion from the definition of an "investment company" provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	A change in the value of any of our assets could cause us or one or more of our wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries to fall within the definition of "investment company" and negatively affect our ability to maintain our exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S4	To avoid being required to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S5	In addition, we may have to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or may have to forgo opportunities to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire and would be important to our investment strategy.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S6	If we were required to register the company as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P47_S7	In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	You are bound by the majority vote on matters on which you are entitled to vote, and therefore, your vote on a particular matter may be superseded by the vote of others.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	You may vote on certain matters at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, including the election of directors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	However, you will be bound by the majority vote on matters requiring approval of a majority of the stockholders even if you do not vote with the majority on any such matter.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	If you do not agree with the decisions of our board of directors, you only have limited control over changes in our policies and operations and may not be able to change such policies and operations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Our board of directors determines our major policies, including our policies regarding investments, financing, growth, debt capitalization, REIT qualification and distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P48_S5	Our board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders except to the extent that such policies are set forth in our charter.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P48_S6	Under the Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter, our stockholders have a right to vote only on the following:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	certain mergers, consolidations or sales or other dispositions of all or substantially all our assets, as provided in our charter.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	All other matters are subject to the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our board of directors may change our investment policies without stockholder approval, which could alter the nature of your investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	These policies may change over time.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The methods of implementing our investment policies also may vary, as new real estate development trends emerge and new investment techniques are developed.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Our investment policies, the methods for their implementation, and our other objectives, policies and procedures may be altered by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	As a result, the nature of your investment could change without your consent.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We will not calculate the net asset value per share for our shares until 18 months after completion of our last offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Therefore, you will not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an on-going basis during our offering and for a substantial period of time thereafter.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P50_S8	We do not intend to calculate the net asset value per share for our shares until 18 months after the completion of our last offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Beginning 18 months after the completion of the last offering of our shares (excluding offerings under our distribution reinvestment plan), our board of directors will determine the value of our properties and our other assets based on such information as our board determines appropriate, which may or may not include independent valuations of our properties or of our enterprise as a whole.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We will disclose this net asset value to stockholders in our filings with the SEC.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Therefore, you will not be able to determine the net asset value of your shares on an on-going basis during our offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	You are limited in your ability to sell your shares pursuant to our share repurchase program and may have to hold your shares for an indefinite period of time.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Our board of directors may amend the terms of our share repurchase program without stockholder approval.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our board of directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program upon 30 days' notice or to reject any request for repurchase.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S6	In addition, the share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that would limit your ability to sell your shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Generally, you must have held your shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S8	Subject to funds being available, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below until we establish an estimated value of our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S9	We do not currently anticipate obtaining appraisals for our investments (other than investments in transactions with our Sponsor, Advisor, directors or their respective affiliates) and, accordingly, the estimated value of our investments should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S10	We expect to begin establishing an estimated value of our shares based on the value of our real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of our offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P51_S11	We will retain persons independent of us and our Advisor to prepare the estimated value of our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Only those stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions may be able to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In other words, once our shares are transferred for value by a stockholder, the transferee and all subsequent holders of the shares are not eligible to participate in the share redemption program.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We will repurchase shares on the last business day of each quarter (and in all events on a date other than a dividend payment date).
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Prior to establishing the estimated value of our shares, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows: (a) the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least one year, (b) the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least two years, (c) the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least three years, and (d) the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least four years (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P53_S2	These limits might prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any year.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P53_S3	These restrictions severely limit your ability to sell your shares should you require liquidity, and limit your ability to recover the value you invested or the fair market value of your shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P53_S4	We established the offering price on an arbitrary basis; as a result, the actual value of your investment may be substantially less than what you pay.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Our board of directors has arbitrarily determined the selling price of the shares, and such price bears no relationship to our book or asset values, or to any other established criteria for valuing issued or outstanding shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Because the offering price is not based upon any independent valuation, the offering price is not indicative of the proceeds that you would receive upon liquidation.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Because our Dealer Manager is one of our affiliates, you will not have the benefit of an independent review of our prospectus or us of the type customarily performed in underwritten offerings.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Our Dealer Manager is one of our affiliates and will not make an independent review of us or the offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Accordingly, you will have to rely on your own broker-dealer to make an independent review of the terms of our offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	If your broker-dealer does not conduct such a review, you will not have the benefit of an independent review of the terms of our offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Further, the due diligence investigation of us by the Dealer Manager cannot be considered to be an independent review and, therefore, may not be as meaningful as a review conducted by an unaffiliated broker-dealer or investment banker.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S5	In addition, we do not, and do not expect to, have research analysts reviewing our performance or our securities on an ongoing basis.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Therefore, you will not have an independent review of our performance and the value of our common stock relative to publicly traded companies.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Because our Advisor is wholly owned by our Sponsor through the Special Limited Partner, the interests of the Advisor and the Sponsor are not separate and as a result the Advisor may act in a way that is not necessarily in the investors' interest.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S8	Our Advisor is indirectly wholly owned by our Sponsor through the Special Limited Partner.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S9	Therefore, the interests of our Advisor and our Sponsor are not separate and the Advisor's decisions may not be independent from the Sponsor and may result in the Advisor making decisions to act in ways that are not in the investors' interests.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S10	Your interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares, which could adversely affect the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S11	Existing stockholders and potential investors in our offering do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S12	Our charter currently authorizes us to issue 350.0 million shares of stock, of which 300.0 million shares are classified as common stock and 50.0 million are classified as preferred stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S13	Our board of directors may increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock, increase or decrease the number of shares of any class or series of stock designated, or reclassify any unissued shares into other classes or series of stock without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S14	All such shares may be issued in the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S15	Existing stockholders and investors purchasing shares in our offering likely will suffer dilution of their equity investment in us if we: (a) sell shares in our offering or sell additional shares in the future, including those issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan; (b) sell securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock; (c) issue shares of our common stock in a private offering of securities to institutional investors; (d) issue restricted share awards to our directors; (e) issue shares to our Advisor or its affiliates, successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation as set forth under our advisory agreement and other agreements; or (f) issue shares of our common stock to sellers of properties acquired by us in connection with an exchange of limited partnership interests of the OP.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S16	In addition, the Partnership Agreement contains provisions that would allow, under certain circumstances, other entities, including other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs, to merge into or cause the exchange or conversion of their interest for interests of the OP.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S17	Because the limited partnership interests of the OP may, in the discretion of our board of directors, be exchanged for shares of our common stock, any merger, exchange or conversion between the OP and another entity ultimately could result in the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, thereby diluting the percentage ownership interest of other stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P54_S18	Because of these and other reasons described in this "Risk Factors" section, you should not expect to be able to own a significant percentage of our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Future offerings of equity securities which are senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation may adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity securities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Under our charter, we may issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock or other classes of common stock with rights that could dilute the value of your shares of common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Any issuance of preferred stock must be approved by a majority of our independent directors not otherwise interested in the transaction, who will have access, at our expense, to our legal counsel or to independent legal counsel.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Upon liquidation, holders of our shares of preferred stock having a preference as to dividend distributions or upon liquidation will be entitled to receive our available assets prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Additionally, any convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay a liquidating distribution or dividends to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share trading price of our common stock and diluting their interest in us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The value of our common shares was diluted upon conversion of the preferred shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	On December 22, 2009, we commenced a private offering to accredited investors of up to $50.0 million in shares of our 8% series A convertible preferred stock (or the preferred shares) subject to an option to increase the offering up to $100.0 million in shares of our preferred stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the private offering, the private offering terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the registration statement.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We received aggregate gross offering proceeds, net of certain discounts, of approximately $17.0 million from the sale of shares in the private offering.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The preferred shares were convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock after September 2, 2011, the first anniversary of the final closing of the private offering, at a conversion price of $9.00 per share (subject to discounts to a price not less than $8.50).
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P59_S4	On December 15, 2011, we exercised our option to convert all our outstanding preferred shares into approximately 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P59_S5	This conversion price was at a discount from the public offering price of our common stock pursuant to our offering and has resulted in dilution of our stockholders' interest in us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Payment of fees to our Advisor and its affiliates reduces cash available for investment and distribution.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Our Advisor and its affiliates perform services for us in connection with conducting our operations and managing the portfolio of real estate and real estate-related debt and investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our Advisor and its affiliates will be paid substantial fees and receive substantial distributions for these services, which reduces the amount of cash available for investment in properties or distribution to stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Because of our holding company structure, we depend on our operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries for cash flow and we will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of such operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S3	We are a holding company with no business operations of our own.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Our only significant asset is and will be the general partnership interests of our operating partnership.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S5	We conduct, and intend to conduct, all of our business operations through our operating partnership.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S6	Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our operating partnership and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S7	We cannot assure you that our operating partnership or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to make distributions to our stockholders from cash flows from operations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S8	Each of our operating partnership's subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from such entities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S9	In addition, because we are a holding company, your claims as stockholders will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P60_S10	Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy your claims as stockholders only after all of our and our operating partnerships' and its subsidiaries' liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	General Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate Losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We carry comprehensive liability and property insurance on our properties and intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be uninsured.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Our operating results will be affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general, and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth in the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	These and other risks may prevent us from being profitable or from realizing growth or maintaining the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S1	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Such a bankruptcy filing would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Post-bankruptcy debts would be paid currently.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S4	If a lease is assumed, all pre-bankruptcy balances owing under it must be paid in full.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S5	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S6	If a lease is rejected, it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant because our claim is capped at the rent reserved under the lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year or 15% of the remaining term of the lease, but not greater than three years, plus rent already due but unpaid.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P64_S7	This claim could be paid only if funds were available, and then only in the same percentage as that realized on other unsecured claims.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	In January 2013, Big M, Inc., a tenant in our 1100 Kings Highway property declared bankruptcy under Chapter 11.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As of December 31, 2012, Big M, Inc. represents 1.6% of our total annualized rental income and owes us approximately $44,000, which was paid in February 2013.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Big M, Inc. has 210 days upon filing for bankruptcy protection to assume or reject its lease.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Such an event could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments that would mean a reduction in our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	In the event of a bankruptcy, we cannot assure you that the tenant or its trustee will assume our lease.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	If a given lease, or guaranty of a lease, is not assumed, our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to you may be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	If a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a tenant's bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you could be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	We may enter into sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we would purchase a property and then lease the same property back to the person from whom we purchased it.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P68_S1	In the event of the bankruptcy of a tenant, a transaction structured as a sale-leaseback may be re-characterized as either a financing or a joint venture, either of which outcomes could adversely affect our business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P68_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a financing, we might not be considered the owner of the property, and as a result would have the status of a creditor in relation to the tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P68_S3	In that event, we would no longer have the right to sell or encumber our ownership interest in the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Instead, we would have a claim against the tenant for the amounts owed under the lease, with the claim arguably secured by the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The tenant/debtor might have the ability to propose a plan restructuring the term, interest rate and amortization schedule of its outstanding balance.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	If confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we could be bound by the new terms, and prevented from foreclosing our lien on the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a joint venture, our lessee and we could be treated as co-venturers with regard to the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S3	As a result, we could be held liable, under some circumstances, for debts incurred by the lessee relating to the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S4	Either of these outcomes could adversely affect our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S5	Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S6	If we enter into sale-leaseback transactions, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a "true lease" for tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S7	However, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge such characterization.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S8	In the event that any such sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to such property would be disallowed.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S9	If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification "asset tests" or "income tests" and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S10	Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P69_S11	Properties that have vacancies for a significant period of time could be difficult to sell, which could diminish the return on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	A property may incur vacancies either by the continued default of tenants under their leases or the expiration of tenant leases.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P70_S1	If vacancies continue for a long period of time, we may suffer reduced revenues resulting in less cash to be distributed to stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In addition, because properties' market values depend principally upon the value of the properties' leases, the resale value of properties with prolonged vacancies could suffer, which could further reduce your return.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We may obtain only limited warranties when we purchase a property and would have only limited recourse if our due diligence did not identify any issues that lower the value of our property, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The seller of a property often sells such property in its "as is" condition on a "where is" basis and "with all faults," without any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular use or purpose.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In addition, purchase agreements may contain only limited warranties, representations and indemnifications that will only survive for a limited period after the closing.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The purchase of properties with limited warranties increases the risk that we may lose some or all our invested capital in the property as well as the loss of rental income from that property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P72_S3	We may be unable to secure funds for future tenant improvements or capital needs, which could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	When tenants do not renew their leases or otherwise vacate their space, it is usual that, in order to attract replacement tenants, we will be required to expend substantial funds for tenant improvements and tenant refurbishments to the vacated space.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In addition, we will likely be responsible for any major structural repairs, such as repairs to the foundation, exterior walls and rooftops, even if our leases with tenants require tenants to pay routine property maintenance costs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S2	We will use substantially all of our offering's gross proceeds to buy real estate and pay various fees and expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S3	We intend to reserve only 0.1% of the gross proceeds from our offering for future capital needs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Accordingly, if we need additional capital in the future to improve or maintain our properties or for any other reason, we will have to obtain financing from other sources, such as cash flow from operations, borrowings, property sales or future equity offerings.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S5	These sources of funding may not be available on attractive terms or at all.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S6	If we cannot procure additional funding for capital improvements, our investments may generate lower cash flows or decline in value, or both.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P73_S7	Our inability to sell a property when we desire to do so could adversely impact our ability to pay cash distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us, or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S3	We may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S4	We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct such defects or to make such improvements.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S5	Moreover, in acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S6	These provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S7	We may not be able to sell our properties at a price equal to, or greater than, the price for which we purchased such property, which may lead to a decrease in the value of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S8	Many of our leases will not contain rental increases over time.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S9	Therefore, the value of the property to a potential purchaser may not increase over time, which may restrict our ability to sell a property, or if we are able to sell such property, may lead to a sale price less than the price that we paid to purchase the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S10	We may acquire or finance properties with lock-out provisions, which may prohibit us from selling a property, or may require us to maintain specified debt levels for a period of years on some properties, either of which could have an adverse affect on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S11	Lock-out provisions could materially restrict us from selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S12	These provisions would affect our ability to turn our investments into cash and thus affect cash available for distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S13	Lock out provisions may prohibit us from reducing the outstanding indebtedness with respect to any properties, refinancing such indebtedness on a non-recourse basis at maturity, or increasing the amount of indebtedness with respect to such properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S14	Lock-out provisions could impair our ability to take other actions during the lock-out period that could be in the best interests of our stockholders and, therefore, may have an adverse impact on the value of the shares, relative to the value that would result if the lock-out provisions did not exist.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P74_S15	In particular, lock-out provisions could preclude us from participating in major transactions that could result in a disposition of our assets or a change in control even though that disposition or change in control might be in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Rising expenses could reduce cash flow and funds available for future acquisitions, which could reduce our ability to pay cash distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Any properties that we now own or buy in the future will be subject to operating risks common to real estate in general, any or all of which may negatively affect us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S1	If any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses, we could be required to expend funds with respect to that property for operating expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S2	The properties will be subject to increases in tax rates, utility costs, operating expenses, insurance costs, repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S3	If renewals of leases or future leases are not negotiated on a triple-net-lease basis or do not require the tenants to pay all or a portion of such expenses, we may have to pay those costs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S4	If we are unable to lease properties on a triple-net-lease basis or on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, or if tenants fail to pay required tax, utility and other impositions, we could be required to pay those costs which could reduce funds available for future acquisitions or cash available for distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S5	If we suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S6	We carry comprehensive general liability coverage, property liability coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties with limits of liability which we deem adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P76_S7	Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we estimate to be adequate to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the rehabilitation period.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Material losses may occur in excess of insurance proceeds with respect to any property, as insurance may not be sufficient to fund the losses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	However, there are types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Insurance risks associated with potential terrorism acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase specific coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S2	It is uncertain whether such insurance policies will be available, or available at reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our potential properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S3	In these instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S4	We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S5	If such an event damaged or destroyed one or more of our properties, we could lose both our invested capital and anticipated profits from such property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S6	Real estate related taxes may increase and if these increases are not passed on to tenants, our income will be reduced, which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S7	Some local real property tax assessors may seek to reassess some of our properties as a result of our acquisition of the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P78_S8	Generally, from time to time our property taxes increase as property values or assessment rates change or for other reasons deemed relevant by the assessors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	An increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes will result in an increase in the related real estate taxes on that property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	There is no assurance that leases will be negotiated on a basis that passes such taxes on to the tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Increases not passed through to tenants will adversely affect our income, cash available for distributions, and the amount of distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	CC Rs may restrict our ability to operate a property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Some of our properties may be contiguous to other parcels of real property, comprising part of the same commercial center.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In connection with such properties, there are significant covenants, conditions and restrictions, ("CC Rs"), restricting the operation of such properties and any improvements on such properties, and related to granting easements on such properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P80_S3	Moreover, the operation and management of the contiguous properties may impact such properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P80_S4	Compliance with CC Rs may adversely affect our operating costs and reduce the amount of funds that we have available to pay distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Our operating results may be negatively affected by potential development and construction delays and resultant increased costs and risks, which may adversely affect the value of your shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We may use proceeds from our offering to acquire and develop properties upon which we will construct improvements.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	We will be subject to uncertainties associated with re-zoning for development, environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups, and our builder's ability to build in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs, and timetables.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S3	If a builder fails to perform, we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S4	A builder's performance also may be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder's control.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S5	Delays in completion of construction could also give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S6	We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to builders before they complete construction.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S7	These and other such factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S8	In addition, we will be subject to normal lease-up risks relating to newly constructed projects.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S9	We also must rely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a price at the time we acquire the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S10	If our projections are inaccurate, we may pay too much for a property, and our return on our investment could suffer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S11	We may invest in unimproved real property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S12	For purposes of this paragraph, "unimproved real property" does not include properties acquired for the purpose of producing rental or other operating income, properties under development or construction, and properties under contract for development or in planning for development within one year.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P81_S13	Returns from development of unimproved properties are also subject to risks associated with re-zoning the land for development and environmental concerns of governmental entities and/or community groups.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	If we invest in unimproved property other than property we intend to develop, your investment will be subject to the risks associated with investments in unimproved real property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Competition with third parties in acquiring properties and other investments may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, including individuals, corporations, bank and insurance company investment accounts, other REITs, real estate limited partnerships, and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities, many of which have greater resources than we do.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Larger REITs may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S4	In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investments may increase.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S5	Any such increase would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S6	If we pay higher prices for properties and other investments, our profitability will be reduced and you may experience a lower return on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S7	Our properties face competition that may affect tenants' ability to pay rent and the amount of rent paid to us may affect the cash available for distributions and the amount of distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S8	Our properties typically are, and we expect will be, located in developed areas such as the New York MSA.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S9	Therefore, there are and will be numerous other properties within the market area of each of our properties that will compete with us for tenants.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S10	The number of competitive properties could have a material effect on our ability to rent space at our properties and the amount of rents charged.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S11	We could be adversely affected if additional competitive properties are built in locations competitive with our properties, causing increased competition for customer traffic and creditworthy tenants.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S12	This could result in decreased cash flow from tenants and may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise made, thus affecting cash available for distributions, and the amount available for distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S13	We may be unable to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S14	We cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above our existing rental rates or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or tenant-favorable renewal options will not be offered to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S15	If the rental rates of our properties decrease, our existing tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space and space for which leases will expire, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to satisfy our principal and interest obligations would be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P82_S16	Moreover, the resale value of our property could be diminished because the market value of the property depends upon the value of the leases of the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Delays in acquisitions of properties may have an adverse effect on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P83_S1	There may be a substantial period of time before the proceeds of our offering are invested.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Delays we encounter in the selection, acquisition and/or development of properties could adversely affect your returns.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Where properties are acquired prior to the start of construction or during the early stages of construction, it will typically take several months to complete construction and rent available space.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Therefore, you could suffer delays in the payment of cash distributions attributable to those particular properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for any distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S1	These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S3	In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S4	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S6	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S7	Additionally, our tenants' operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties may affect our properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S8	In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply, and that may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P85_S9	Any material expenditures, fines, or damages we must pay will reduce our ability to make distributions and may reduce the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S0	State and federal laws in this area are constantly evolving.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We intend to obtain environmental assessments of most properties that we acquire; however, we will not obtain an independent third-party environmental assessment for every property we acquire.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S2	In addition, any such assessment that we do obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities or that a prior owner of a property did not create a material environmental condition not known to us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S3	The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims would materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S4	If we sell properties by providing financing to purchasers, defaults by the purchasers would adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to make distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S5	If we decide to sell any of our properties, we intend to use our best efforts to sell them for cash.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S6	However, in some instances we may sell our properties by providing financing to purchasers.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S7	When we provide financing to purchasers, we will bear the risk that the purchaser may default, which could negatively impact our cash distributions to stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S8	Even in the absence of a purchaser default, the distribution of the proceeds of sales to our stockholders, or their reinvestment in other assets, will be delayed until the promissory notes or other property we may accept upon the sale are actually paid, sold, refinanced or otherwise disposed of.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S9	In some cases, we may receive initial down payments in cash and other property in the year of sale in an amount less than the selling price and subsequent payments will be spread over a number of years.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S10	If any purchaser defaults under a financing arrangement with us, it could negatively impact our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S11	Our recovery of an investment in a mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loan that has defaulted may be limited, resulting in losses to us and reducing the amount of funds available to pay distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P86_S12	There is no guarantee that the mortgage, loan or deed of trust securing an investment will, following a default, permit us to recover the original investment and interest that would have been received absent a default.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The security provided by a mortgage, deed of trust or loan is directly related to the difference between the amount owed and the appraised market value of the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Even though we intend to rely on a current real estate appraisal when we make the investment, the value of the property is affected by factors outside our control, including general fluctuations in the real estate market, rezoning, neighborhood changes, highway relocations and failure by the borrower to maintain the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In addition, we may incur the costs of litigation in our efforts to enforce our rights under defaulted loans.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P88_S0	Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of co-venturers and disputes between us and our co-venturers.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We are curently party to two joint ventures and may enter into other partnerships and co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments) for the purpose of making investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P88_S2	We are not in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding such joint ventures.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their required capital contributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S2	Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the co-venturer would have full control over the joint venture.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Disputes between us and co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S4	Consequently, actions by or disputes with co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S5	In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our co-venturers.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S6	Our costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S7	Our properties will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "Disabilities Act").
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S8	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S9	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial facilities" that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P89_S10	The Disabilities Act's requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties that comply with the Disabilities Act or place the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with the Disabilities Act.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P90_S1	However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If we cannot, our funds used for Disabilities Act compliance may affect cash available for distributions and the amount of distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Economic conditions may adversely affect our income and we could be subject to risks associated with acquiring discounted real estate assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P91_S0	U.S. and international markets are recently have experienced increased levels of volatility due to a combination of many factors, including decreasing values of home prices, limited access to credit markets, higher fuel prices, less consumer spending and fears of a national and global recession.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The effects of such market dislocation may persist as financial institutions continue to take the necessary steps to restructure their business and capital structures.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P91_S2	As a result, this economic downturn has reduced demand for space and removed support for rents and property values.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Since we cannot predict how well the real estate markets will recover, the value of our properties may decline if current market conditions persist or worsen.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In addition, we will be subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership of discounted real estate assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Such assets may be purchased at a discount from historical cost due to, among other things, substantial deferred maintenance, abandonment, undesirable locations or markets, or poorly structured financing of the real estate or debt instruments underlying the assets, which has since lowered their value.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Further, the continuing instability in the financial markets has limited the availability of lines of credit and the degree to which people and entities have access to cash to pay rents or debt service on the underlying the assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Such illiquidity has the effect of increasing vacancies, increasing bankruptcies and weakening interest rates commercial entities can charge consumers, which can all decrease the value of already discounted real estate assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S5	Should conditions worsen, the continued inability of the underlying real estate assets to produce income may weaken our return on our investments, which, in turn, may weaken your return on investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S6	Further, irrespective of the instability the financial markets may have on the return produced by discounted real estate assets, the evolving efforts to correct the instability make the valuation of such assets highly unpredictable.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S7	The fluctuation in market conditions make judging the future performance of such assets difficult.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P92_S8	There is a risk that we may not purchase real estate assets at absolute discounted rates and that such assets may continue to decline in value.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Potential changes in U.S. accounting standards regarding operating leases may make the leasing of our properties less attractive to our potential tenants, which could reduce overall demand for our leasing services.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Under current authoritative accounting guidance for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P94_S2	If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant's balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P94_S3	Thus, entering into an operating lease can appear to enhance a tenant's balance sheet in comparison to direct ownership.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P95_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P95_S1	In August 2010, the FASB and the IASB jointly released exposure drafts of a proposed accounting model that would significantly change lease accounting.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P95_S2	Final standards have yet to be issued.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P95_S3	Changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P95_S4	These changes may affect how the real estate leasing business is conducted.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P95_S5	For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P95_S6	This in turn could cause a delay in investing our offering proceeds and make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Retail Industry Risks Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P96_S1	A retail property's revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P96_S2	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our common stock may be negatively impacted.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P96_S3	Some of our leases may provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P96_S4	A number of our retail leases also may include a percentage rent clause for additional rent above the base amount based upon a specified percentage of the sales our tenants generate.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P96_S5	Under those leases which contain percentage rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P97_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we may derive from percentage rent leases could decline upon a general economic downturn.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P97_S3	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P98_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our financial condition.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P99_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant's lease is terminated.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S1	These "co-tenancy" provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S8	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S9	If we acquire retail properties, our retail tenants will face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs, internet websites and telemarketing.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S10	Other retail centers within the market area of our properties will compete with our properties for customers, affecting their tenants' cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S11	In addition, some of our tenants' rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P100_S12	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Office Industry Risks Declines in overall activity in our markets may adversely affect the performance of our office properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Our office properties may be adversely affected by market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Because our portfolio will include commercial office buildings located principally in the New York MSA, if economic conditions persist or deteriorate, then our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service current debt and to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by the following potential conditions, among others:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S0	that reduced liquidity in debt markets and increased credit risk premiums for certain market participants may impair our ability to access capital.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S1	These conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions, may continue or worsen in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S2	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S4	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S5	The loss of anchor tenants for our office properties could adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S6	We may acquire office properties and, as with our retail properties, we are subject to the risk that tenants may be unable to make their lease payments or may decline to extend a lease upon its expiration.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S7	A lease termination by a tenant that occupies a large area of space in one of our office properties (commonly referred to as an anchor tenant) could impact leases of other tenants.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S8	Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of a lease termination by an anchor tenant or the closure of the business of an anchor tenant that leaves its space vacant, even if the anchor tenant continues to pay rent.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S9	Any such modifications or conditions could be unfavorable to us as the property owner and could decrease rents or expense recoveries.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S10	In the event of default by an anchor tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S11	Residential Industry Risks The short-term nature of our residential leases may adversely impact our income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S12	If our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their units.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S13	Because substantially all our residential leases will be for apartments, they generally will be for terms of no more than one or two years.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P103_S14	If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P104_S0	Certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances result in a reduction in rental income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P105_S0	An economic downturn could adversely affect the residential industry and may affect operations for the residential properties that we acquire.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P105_S1	As a result of the effects of an economic downturn, including increased unemployment rates, the residential industry may experience a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in overall renters.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P105_S2	The current economic downturn and increase in unemployment rates may have an adverse affect on our operations if the tenants occupying the residential properties we acquire cease making rent payments to us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Moreover, low residential mortgage interest rates could accompany an economic downturn and encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P105_S4	The residential properties we acquire may experience declines in occupancy rate due to any such decline in residential mortgage interest rates.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The hotel industry is very competitive and seasonal and has been affected by economic slowdowns, terrorist attacks and other world events.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S0	The hotel industry is intensely competitive and seasonal in nature and has been affected by the current economic slowdown, terrorist attacks, military activity in the Middle East, natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy and the travel and hotel industries, and, as a result, our lodging properties may be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Since the hotel industry is intensely competitive, our third-party management company and our third-party tenants may be unable to compete successfully or if our competitors' marketing strategies are more effective, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders, may be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S2	In particular, as a result of terrorist attacks around the world, the war in Iraq and the effects of the economic recession, subsequent to 2001 the lodging industry experienced a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in both business and leisure travel.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S3	Our business and lodging properties may continue to be affected by such events, including our hotel occupancy levels and average daily rates, and, as a result, our revenues may decrease or not increase to levels we expect.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S4	Since we do not intend to operate our lodging properties, our revenues depend on the ability of our third-party management company and our-third party tenants to compete successfully with other hotels in the New York MSA.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S5	Some of our competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S6	If our third-party management company and our third-party tenants are unable to compete successfully, including competition from Internet intermediaries, or if our competitors' marketing strategies are effective, our results of operations, financial condition, ability to service debt and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P107_S7	In addition, the seasonality of the hotel industry can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and also may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, such as extreme or unexpectedly mild weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P108_S0	To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues, we may attempt to borrow in order to make distributions to our stockholders or be required to reduce other expenditures or distributions to stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Our profitability may be adversely affected by unstable market and business conditions and insufficient demand for lodging due to reduced business and leisure travel.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Our hotels will be subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P108_S3	These risks could adversely affect hotel occupancy and the rates that can be charged for hotel rooms as well as hotel operating expenses, and generally include:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P109_S0	risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate, as discussed below.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P109_S1	We do not have control over the market and business conditions that affect the value of our lodging properties, and adverse changes with respect to such conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Hotel properties are subject to varying degrees of risk generally common to the ownership of hotels, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P110_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Adverse changes in any or all these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, thereby adversely impacting our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S0	As a REIT, we cannot directly operate our lodging properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, which could impact our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S1	We cannot and will not directly operate our lodging properties and, as a result, our results of operations, financial position, ability to service debt and our ability to make distributions to stockholders are dependent on the ability of our third-party management companies and our tenants to operate our hotel properties successfully.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S2	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly operate any lodging properties we may acquire or actively participate in the decisions affecting their daily operations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Instead, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, we must enter into management agreements with a third-party management company, or we must lease our lodging properties to third-party tenants on a triple-net lease basis.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S4	We cannot and will not control this third-party management company or the tenants who operate and are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of our lodging properties, including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S5	Thus, even if we believe our lodging properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party management company or the tenants to change their method of operation of our lodging properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S6	Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and our ability to service debt and to make distributions to stockholders are, therefore, dependent on the ability of our third-party management company and tenants to operate our lodging properties successfully.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S7	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator and/or its affiliated brands generally may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and consequently cash flows thereby impacting our ability to service debt, and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S8	There can be no assurance that our affiliate continues to manage any lodging properties we acquire.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S9	We will rely on a third-party hotel management company to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S10	In doing this, the Property Manager should have policies and procedures in place which allow it to effectively monitor and report to us the operating results of our lodging properties which ultimately are included in our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S11	Because the operations of our lodging properties ultimately become a component of our consolidated financial statements, we evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting at all our properties, including our lodging properties, in connection with the certifications we provide in our quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S12	However, we will not control the design or implementation of or changes to internal controls at any of our lodging properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S13	Thus, even if we believe that our lodging properties are being operated without effective internal controls, we may not be able to require the third-party management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S14	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S15	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S16	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party management company will implement at our lodging properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S17	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at one or more of our lodging properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S18	If we replace a third-party management company or tenant, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement or lease to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at the affected lodging properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S19	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party management company or tenants with substantial prior lodging experience in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S20	If we experience such disruptions, it may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P112_S21	Industrial Industry Risks Potential liability as the result of, and the cost of compliance with, environmental matters is greater if we invest in industrial properties or lease our properties to tenants that engage in industrial activities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P113_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on such property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P114_S0	We may invest in properties historically used for industrial, manufacturing and commercial purposes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Some of these properties are more likely to contain, or may have contained, underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P114_S2	All of these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Leasing properties to tenants that engage in industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities will cause us to be subject to increased risk of liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P115_S1	The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P115_S2	The demand for and profitability of our industrial properties may be adversely affected by fluctuations in manufacturing activity in the United States.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P116_S0	Our industrial properties may be adversely affected if manufacturing activity decreases in the United States.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Trade agreements with foreign countries have given employers the option to utilize less expensive non-US manufacturing workers.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P117_S1	The outsourcing of manufacturing functions could lower the demand for our industrial properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Moreover, an increase in the cost of raw materials or decrease in the demand of housing could cause a slowdown in manufacturing activity, such as furniture, textiles, machinery and chemical products, and our profitability may be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P117_S3	Our portfolio may be negatively impacted by a high concentration of industrial tenants in a single industry.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P117_S4	If we invest in industrial properties, we may lease properties to tenants that engage in similar industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P117_S5	A high concentration of tenants in a specific industry would magnify the adverse impact that a downturn in such industry might otherwise have to our portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P117_S6	We have broad authority to incur debt, and high levels of debt could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P118_S0	We expect that in most instances, we will acquire real properties by using either existing financing or borrowing new funds.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P118_S1	In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge all or some of our real properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P119_S0	We may borrow if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P119_S1	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Our Advisor believes that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objective of maximizing the return to investors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S0	There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S1	Under our charter, our borrowings may not exceed 300% of our total "net assets" (as defined in our charter and in accordance with the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S2	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S3	In addition, it is our intention to limit our borrowings to 40% to 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets (calculated after the close of our offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our offering), unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for such excess borrowing.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S4	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S5	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S6	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S7	We expect that during the period of our offering we will seek independent director approval of borrowings in excess of these limitations since we will then be in the process of raising our equity capital to acquire our portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S8	As a result, we expect that our debt levels will be higher until we have invested most of our capital.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S9	High debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges, would result in higher debt service payments and could be accompanied by restrictive covenants.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P120_S10	These factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P121_S0	If there is a shortfall between the cash flow from a property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on a property, then the amount available for distributions to stockholders may be reduced.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P121_S1	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P121_S2	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P121_S3	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P121_S4	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P121_S5	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of distributions required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P122_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P122_S1	When we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P123_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P123_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the value of your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P123_S2	The current state of debt markets could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S0	The domestic and international commercial real estate debt markets are currently experiencing a tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S1	This is resulting in lenders increasing the cost for debt financing.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S2	Should the overall cost of borrowings increase, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, we will need to factor such increases into the economics of future acquisitions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S3	This may result in future acquisitions generating lower overall economic returns and potentially reducing future cash flow available for distribution.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S4	If these disruptions in the debt markets persist, our ability to borrow monies to finance the purchase of, or other activities related to, real estate assets will be negatively impacted.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S5	If we are unable to borrow monies on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, we likely will have to reduce the number of properties we can purchase, and the return on the properties we do purchase may be lower.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S6	In addition, we may find it difficult, costly or impossible to refinance indebtedness which is maturing.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S7	In addition, the state of the debt markets could have an impact on the overall amount of capital invested in real estate which may result in price or value decreases of real estate assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S8	This could negatively impact the current value of our existing assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S9	High mortgage rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance properties, which could reduce the number of properties we can acquire and the amount of cash distributions we can make.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S10	If we place mortgage debt on properties, we run the risk of being unable to refinance the properties when the loans come due, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S11	If interest rates are higher when the properties are refinanced, we may not be able to finance the properties and our income could be reduced.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S12	If any of these events occur, our cash flow would be reduced.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S13	This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution to you and may hinder our ability to raise more capital by issuing more stock or by borrowing more money.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S14	Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S15	In connection with providing us financing, a lender could impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S16	Loan documents we enter into may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property, discontinue insurance coverage or replace our Advisor.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S17	These or other limitations may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our investment and operating objectives.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S18	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S19	We expect that we will incur indebtedness in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S20	To the extent that we incur variable rate debt, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay distributions to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S21	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S22	We may invest in collateralized mortgage-backed securities, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk and the risks of the securitization process.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S23	We may invest in CMBS, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P124_S24	We have not adopted, and do not expect to adopt, any formal policies or procedures designed to manage risks associated with our investments in CMBS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P125_S0	In this context, credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P126_S0	Interest rate risk occurs as prevailing market interest rates change relative to the current yield on the CMBS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P126_S1	For example, when interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their existing mortgages to take advantage of the lower cost of financing.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P126_S2	As prepayments occur, principal is returned to the holders of the CMBS sooner than expected, thereby lowering the effective yield on the investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P126_S3	On the other hand, when interest rates rise, borrowers are more likely to maintain their existing mortgages.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P126_S4	As a result, prepayments decrease, thereby extending the average maturity of the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P127_S0	CMBS are also subject to several risks created through the securitization process.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P128_S0	Subordinate CMBS are paid interest only to the extent that there are funds available to make payments.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P128_S1	To the extent the collateral pool includes delinquent loans, there is a risk that the interest payment on subordinate CMBS will not be fully paid.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P128_S2	Subordinate CMBS are also subject to greater credit risk than those CMBS that are more highly rated.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P128_S3	If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you will be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Any real estate debt security that we originate or purchase is subject to the risks of delinquency and foreclosure.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P130_S0	We may originate and purchase real estate debt securities, which are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P130_S1	Typically, we will not have recourse to the personal assets of our borrowers.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P131_S0	The ability of a borrower to repay a real estate debt security secured by an income-producing property depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property, rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P131_S1	If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the real estate debt security may be impaired.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P131_S2	A property's net operating income can be affected by, among other things:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P132_S0	increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P133_S0	We bear the risks of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the real estate debt security, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P134_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a real estate debt security borrower, the real estate debt security to that borrower will be deemed to be collateralized only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the real estate debt security will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P135_S0	Foreclosure of a real estate debt security can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed real estate debt security.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P135_S1	We also may be forced to foreclose on certain properties, be unable to sell these properties and be forced to incur substantial expenses to improve operations at the property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S0	U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and the market price of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S1	We believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010, and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S2	However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in the best interests of our stockholders, or inadvertently.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S3	Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S4	However, the REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S5	Furthermore, any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and is not a guarantee that we will qualify, or continue to qualify, as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S6	Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S7	Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S8	Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S9	Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S10	Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S11	If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S12	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S13	Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S14	In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S15	If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S16	Even if we fail to qualify as a REIT, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for distribution to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S17	Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P136_S18	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are "dealer" properties sold by a REIT (a "prohibited transaction" under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P137_S0	We may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P137_S1	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P137_S2	In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P137_S3	However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P138_S0	We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P138_S1	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our Operating Partnership or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P138_S2	Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for distribution to you.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P139_S0	To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P139_S1	This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce your overall return.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P140_S0	In order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for distributions paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P140_S1	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (i) 85% of our ordinary income, (ii) 95% of our capital gain net income and (iii) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P140_S2	These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P141_S0	Although we intend to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT, it is possible that we might not always be able to do so.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P142_S0	Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax, which could reduce the return on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P143_S0	For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition is restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P143_S1	Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P144_S0	Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P144_S1	While we qualify as a REIT, we avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (1) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS will incur corporate rate income taxes with respect to any income or gain recognized by it), (2) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction or (3) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with the requirements of the prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for properties that, among other requirements have been held for at least two years.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P144_S2	Despite our present intention, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding our TRSs, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P144_S3	Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P145_S0	A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P145_S1	Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P145_S2	A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P145_S3	Overall, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P145_S4	A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P146_S0	We must operate our "qualified lodging facilities" through one or more TRS that lease such properties from us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P146_S1	We may use our TRSs generally for other activities as well, such as to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S0	A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S1	In addition, the rules, which are applicable to us as a REIT, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S2	If our leases to our TRSs are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S3	In order for such rent to qualify as "rents from real property" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S4	If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S5	If our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S6	We intend to maintain the status of the operating partnership as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S7	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of the operating partnership as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S8	In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that the operating partnership could make to us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S9	This also would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S10	This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the yield on your investment.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S11	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which the operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P147_S12	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P148_S0	If our "qualified lodging facilities" are not properly leased to a TRS or the managers of such "qualified lodging facilities" do not qualify as "eligible independent contractors," we could fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P148_S1	In general, we cannot operate any lodging facilities and can only indirectly participate in the operation of "qualified lodging facilities" on an after-tax basis through leases of such properties to our TRSs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P149_S0	A "qualified lodging facility" is a hotel, motel, or other establishment in which more than one-half of the dwelling units are used on a transient basis at which or in connection with which wagering activities are not conducted.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P149_S1	Rent paid by a lessee that is a "related party tenant" of ours will not be qualifying income for purposes of the two gross income tests applicable to REITs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P149_S2	Each of the management companies that enters into a management contract with our TRSs must qualify as an "eligible independent contractor" under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to us by our TRSs to be qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P149_S3	An "eligible independent contractor" is an independent contractor that, at the time such contractor enters into a management or other agreement with a TRS to operate a "qualified lodging facility," is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating "qualified lodging facilities" for any person not related, as defined in the Code, to us or the TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P149_S4	Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an independent contractor a manager must not own, directly or applying attribution provisions of the Code, more than 35% of our outstanding shares of stock (by value), and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and 35% of the ownership interests of the manager (taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interest in such managers that are publicly traded, only holders of more than 5% of such ownership interests).
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S0	The ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of the 35% thresholds are complex.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S1	There can be no assurance that the levels of ownership of our stock by our managers and their owners will not be exceeded.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S2	Our investments in certain debt instruments may cause us to recognize "phantom income" for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though no cash payments have been received on the debt instruments, and certain modifications of such debt by us could cause the modified debt to not qualify as a good REIT asset, thereby jeopardizing our REIT qualification.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S3	Our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S4	In addition, if a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S5	As a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S6	In such circumstances, we may be required to (a) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (b) borrow on unfavorable terms, (c) distribute amounts that would otherwise be used for future acquisitions or used to repay debt, or (d) make a taxable distribution of our shares of common stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares of common stock or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S7	Moreover, we may acquire distressed debt investments that require subsequent modification by agreement with the borrower.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S8	If the amendments to the outstanding debt are "significant modifications" under the applicable Treasury Regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt taxable exchange with the borrower.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S9	This deemed reissuance may prevent the modified debt from qualifying as a good REIT asset if the underlying security has declined in value and would cause us to recognize income to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S10	The failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S11	In general, in order for a loan to be treated as a qualifying real estate asset producing qualifying income for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, the loan must be secured by real property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S12	We may acquire mezzanine loans that are not directly secured by real property but instead secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S13	In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan that is not secured by real estate would, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S14	Although the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law and in many cases it may not be possible for us to meet all the requirements of the safe harbor.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S15	We cannot provide assurance that any mezzanine loan in which we invest would be treated as a qualifying asset producing qualifying income for REIT qualification purposes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P150_S16	If any such loan fails either the REIT income or asset tests, we may be disqualified as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S0	We may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S1	In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S2	In order to satisfy this requirement, we may make distributions that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such distributions) at the election of each stockholder.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S3	Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S4	As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S5	Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S6	If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S7	Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P151_S8	In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income, such sale may put downward pressure on the price of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P152_S0	Various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock distribution are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P152_S1	No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock distributions, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock distributions have not been met.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S0	The taxation of distributions to our stockholders can be complex; however, distributions that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income, which may reduce your anticipated return from an investment in us.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S1	Distributions that we make to our taxable stockholders out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S2	However, a portion of our distributions may (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (2) be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from our TRSs, or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S3	A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S4	Our stockholders may have tax liability on distributions that they elect to reinvest in common stock, but they would not receive the cash from such distributions to pay such tax liability.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S5	If our stockholders participate in our distribution reinvestment program, they will be deemed to have received, and for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed on, the amount reinvested in shares of our common stock to the extent the amount reinvested was not a tax-free return of capital.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S6	In addition, our stockholders will be treated for tax purposes as having received an additional distribution to the extent the shares are purchased at a discount to fair market value.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P153_S7	As a result, unless a stockholder is a tax-exempt entity, it may have to use funds from other sources to pay its tax liability on the value of the shares of common stock received.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P154_S0	Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P154_S1	Currently, the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P154_S2	Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P154_S3	Although this does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P155_S0	Tax rates could be changed in future legislation.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P156_S0	If we were considered to actually or constructively pay a "preferential dividend" to certain of our stockholders, our status as a REIT could be adversely affected.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P156_S1	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P156_S2	A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S0	Currently, there is uncertainty as to the IRS's position regarding whether certain arrangements that REITs have with their stockholders could give rise to the inadvertent payment of a preferential dividend (e.g., the pricing methodology for stock purchased under a distribution reinvestment program inadvertently causing a greater than 5% discount on the price of such stock purchased).
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S1	There is no de minimis exception with respect to preferential dividends; therefore, if the IRS were to take the position that we inadvertently paid a preferential dividend, we may be deemed to have failed the 90% distribution test, and our status as a REIT could be terminated for the year in which such determination is made if we were unable to cure such failure.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S2	While we believe that our operations have been structured in such a manner that we will not be treated as inadvertently paying preferential dividends, we can provide no assurance to this effect.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S3	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S4	The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S5	Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S6	To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S7	As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S8	This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P157_S9	In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P158_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S1	The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S2	In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 25% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRS.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S4	As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S5	These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S6	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S7	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S8	While we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P159_S9	If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our stockholders and on the market price of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P160_S0	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the price of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P161_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P161_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P161_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P161_S3	You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P161_S4	You also should note that our counsel's tax opinion is based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P162_S0	Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P162_S1	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P162_S2	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P162_S3	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P162_S4	Subject to certain exceptions, distributions received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P162_S5	Such dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as "effectively connected" with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P163_S0	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ("FIRPTA") capital gain distributions attributable to sales or exchanges of "U.S. real property interests" ("USRPIs") generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P163_S1	However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 5% of the class of our stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date the distribution is received.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P163_S2	We do not anticipate that our shares will be "regularly traded" on an established securities market for the foreseeable future, and therefore, this exception is not expected to apply.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P163_S3	Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P164_S0	A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT's stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P164_S1	We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P164_S2	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if (a) our common stock is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P164_S3	However, it is not anticipated that our common stock will be "regularly traded" on an established market.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P164_S4	We encourage you to consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences applicable to you if you are a non-U.S. stockholder.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P165_S0	Potential characterization of distributions or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax-exempt investors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P165_S1	If (a) we are a "pension-held REIT," (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred (or is deemed to have incurred) debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Code.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P166_S0	In order to avoid triggering additional taxes and/or penalties, if you intend to invest in our shares through pension or profit-sharing trusts or IRAs, you should consider additional factors.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P166_S1	Our management has attempted to structure us in such a manner that we will be an attractive investment vehicle for pension, profit-sharing, 401(k), Keogh and other qualified retirement plans and IRAs.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P166_S2	However, in considering an investment in our shares, those involved with making such an investment decision should consider applicable provisions of the Code and ERISA.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P166_S3	While each of the ERISA and Code issues discussed below may not apply to all such plans and IRAs, individuals involved with making investment decisions with respect to such plans and IRAs should carefully review the items described below, and determine their applicability to their situation.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P166_S4	Any such prospective investors are required to consult their own legal and tax advisors on these matters.
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P166_S5	In general, individuals making investment decisions with respect to such plans and IRAs should, at a minimum, consider:
1474464_13_ITEM1A_P167_S0	whether the investment would constitute or give rise to a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code, if applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we owned 16 properties located in the New York MSA.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	These properties are 96.0% leased on a weighted average basis with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.5 years as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	In the aggregate, these properties represent 0.6 million rentable square feet.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	The following table presents certain additional information about the properties we own at December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	______________________________ (1) Remaining lease term in years as of December 31, 2012 , calculated on a weighted-average basis.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	(2) Annualized net operating income for the year ended December 31, 2012 or since acquisition date.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	Net operating income is rental income on a straight-line basis, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable, plus operating expense reimbursement revenue less property operating expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P3_S1	(3) Contract purchase price, excluding acquisition related costs.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P3_S2	(4) Annualized net operating income divided by base purchase price.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P3_S3	(5) Annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 for the in-place leases in the property portfolio on a straight-line basis, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P3_S4	(6) Non-controlling interest holders contributed $13.0 million to purchase this portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	The Company redeemed $12.0 million of an affiliate's non-controlling interest during three months ended June 30, 2012.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P4_S1	(7) Non-controlling interest holder retained an equity interest in the property with a value of $0.4 million , which is excluded from the cash purchase price of $31.5 million reported above.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P5_S0	The following table presents future minimum base rent payments, on a cash basis, due to us over the next ten years and thereafter at the properties we own as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM2_P5_S1	These amounts exclude contingent rental payments, as applicable, that may be collected from certain tenants based on provisions related to sales thresholds and increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes among other items.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P6_S0	The following is a summary of lease expirations for the next ten years at the properties we own as of December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM2_P7_S0	_____________________________ (1) Annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 for the leases in place in the property portfolio on a straight-line basis, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P8_S0	________________________________ (1) Remaining lease term in years as of December 31, 2012 , calculated on a weighted-average basis.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P8_S1	(2) Annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 for the in-place leases in the property portfolio on a straight-line basis, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P8_S2	The rentable square feet or annualized net operating income of the Interior Design Building and the properties located at 1100 Kings Highway, 256 West 38th Street and 229 West 36th Street represent a significant portion of our total portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P8_S3	The tenant concentrations of the Interior Design Building and the properties located at 1100 Kings Highway, 256 West 38th Street and 229 West 36th Street are summarized below.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P8_S4	Interior Design Building The following table lists tenants in the Interior Design Building whose rented square footage is greater than 10% of the total rentable square footage of the Interior Design Building as of December 31, 2012 :

1474464_13_ITEM2_P10_S0	The following table lists tenants at 1100 Kings Highway whose rented square footage is greater than 10% of the total rentable square footage of 1100 Kings Highway as of December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM2_P11_S0	_____________________________ (2) Annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 for the in-place leases in the property portfolio on a straight-line basis, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P11_S1	The following table lists tenants at 256 West 38th Street whose rented square footage is greater than 10% of the total rentable square footage of 256 West 38th Street as of December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM2_P12_S0	_____________________________ (2) Annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 for the in-place leases in the property portfolio on a straight-line basis, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P12_S1	The following table lists tenants at 229 West 36th Street whose rented square footage is greater than 10% of the total rentable square footage of 229 West 36th Street as of December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM2_P13_S0	_____________________________ (2) Annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 for the in-place leases in the property portfolio on a straight-line basis, which includes tenant concessions such as free rent, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P14_S0	Property Financing The Company's mortgage notes payable as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 consist of the following:
1474464_13_ITEM2_P15_S0	______________________ (1) Fixed through an interest rate swap agreement.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P15_S1	(2) Mezzanine loans collateralized by the 256 West 38th Street and 229 West 36th Street properties, respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P15_S2	The mezzanine loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 5% through July 2013 and LIBOR plus 8% thereafter.
1474464_13_ITEM2_P15_S3	These mezzanine loans were repaid in full in January 2013.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	In order for Financial Industry Regulatory Authority members and their associated persons to participate in the offering and sale of shares of common stock pursuant to our offering, we are required pursuant to FINRA Rule 2310(b)(5) to disclose in each annual report distributed to stockholders a per share estimated value of the shares, the method by which it was developed and the date of the data used to develop the estimated value.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	In addition, we prepare annual statements of estimated share value to assist fiduciaries of retirement plans subject to the annual reporting requirements of ERISA in the preparation of their reports relating to an investment in our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	During our offering the value of the shares is deemed to be the offering price of $10.00 per share (without regard to purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers), as adjusted for any special distribution of net sales proceeds.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	There is no public trading market for the shares at this time, and there can be no assurance that stockholders would receive $10.00 per share if such a market did exist and they sold their shares or that they will be able to receive such amount for their shares in the future.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P0_S4	Nor does this deemed value reflect the distributions that stockholders would be entitled to receive if our properties were sold and the sale proceeds were distributed upon liquidation of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P0_S5	Such a distribution upon liquidation may be less than $10.00 per share primarily due to the fact that the funds initially available for investment in properties were reduced from the gross offering proceeds in order to pay selling commissions and dealer manager fees, organization and offering expenses, and acquisition and advisory fees.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	As of February 28, 2013 , we had 23.9 million shares of common stock outstanding held by a total of 6,641 stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	We have elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S2	As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S3	The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S4	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors approved, and we declared, a distribution rate equal to a 6.05% annualized rate based on the common share price of $10.00, or $0.605 per share per annum, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S5	The dividend is calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S6	From a tax perspective, of the amounts distributed during the year ended December 31, 2012, 83.8%, or $0.51 per share per annum, and 16.2%, or $0.095 per share per annum, represented a return of capital and ordinary dividends, respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2011, 100.0%, or $0.61 per share per annum, represented a return of capital.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P1_S8	Our distributions are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P2_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P2_S2	The first distribution was paid in January 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P2_S3	The following table reflects distributions paid in cash and through the DRIP to common stockholders during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	We, our board of directors and Advisor share a similar philosophy with respect to paying our distribution.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	The distribution should principally be derived from cash flows generated from real estate operations.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S2	In order to improve our operating cash flows and our ability to pay distributions from operating cash flows, our related party Advisor and Property Manager agreed to waive certain fees including asset management and property management fees.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S3	Prior to July 1, 2012 we paid the Advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the aggregate contract purchase price of all real estate investments.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S4	Effective July 1, 2012, we intend to issue to the Advisor restricted performance based Class B units for asset management fees, which will be forfeited immediately if certain conditions occur.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S5	In December 2012 and January 2013, the board of directors approved the issuance of 43,968 and 72,211 Class B units to the Advisor in connection with this arrangement.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S6	We also pay our Property Manager a property management fee of up to 4% per annum of the gross revenues of properties managed.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S7	The Advisor elected to waive the asset management fees for the first six months of 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 and the Property Manager elected to waive the property management fees for both the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , which together aggregated $1.0 million and $0.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S8	The Advisor and Property Manager will determine if a portion of property management fees will be waived in subsequent periods on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S9	The fees that were waived are not deferrals and accordingly, will not be paid by us.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S10	Because the Advisor waived certain fees that we owed, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor and the Property Manager was available to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S11	In certain instances, to improve our working capital, the Advisor may elect to absorb a portion of our costs that would otherwise have been paid by us.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S12	During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Advisor absorbed $1.0 million and $0.9 million , respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S13	Additionally, the Advisor at its election may contribute capital to enhance our cash position for distribution purposes.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S14	Any contributed capital amounts are not reimbursable to our Advisor.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S15	Further, any capital contributions are made without any corresponding issuance of common or preferred shares of beneficial interest.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S16	The Advisor did not contribute any capital during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S17	The Advisor contributed approximately $15,000 to us during the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S18	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , cash used to pay our distributions was generated mainly from funds received from cash flows provided by operations, proceeds from common stock issued under the DRIP and proceeds from financings.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S19	As additional capital is raised and we continue to build our portfolio of investments, we expect that we will use funds received from operating activities to pay a greater proportion of our distributions and will be able to reduce and in the future eliminate the use of funds from the sale of common stock to pay distributions .
1474464_13_ITEM5_P3_S20	As the cash flows from operations become more significant our Advisor and Property Manager may discontinue its past practice of forgiving fees and providing contributions and may charge the full fee owed to it in accordance with our agreements.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P4_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P4_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P5_S0	Share-Based Compensation Plans We have a stock option plan (the "Plan") which authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options to our independent directors, subject to the absolute discretion of the board of directors and the applicable limitations of the Plan.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P5_S1	The exercise price for all stock options granted under the Plan will be fixed at $10.00 per share until the termination of the IPO, and thereafter the exercise price for stock options granted to the independent directors will be equal to the fair market value of a share on the last business day preceding the annual meeting of stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P5_S2	A total of 0.5 million shares have been authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P5_S3	Notwithstanding any other provisions of our Plan to the contrary, no stock option issued pursuant thereto may be exercised if such exercise would jeopardize our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P6_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our stock option plan as of December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	Restricted Share Plan We have an employee and director incentive restricted share plan (the "RSP") that provides for the automatic grant of 3,000 restricted shares of common stock to each of the independent directors, without any further action by our board of directors or the stockholders, on the date of initial election to the board of directors and on the date of each annual stockholder's meeting.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P7_S1	Restricted stock issued to independent directors will vest over a five-year period following the first anniversary of the date of grant in increments of 20% per annum.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P8_S0	The RSP provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to the Company, certain consultants to the Company and the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P8_S1	The total number of shares of common stock granted under the RSP shall not exceed 5.0% of the Company's outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis at any time, and in any event will not exceed 7.5 million shares (as such number may be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and similar events).
1474464_13_ITEM5_P9_S0	Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of common stock from the Company under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P9_S1	Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient's employment or other relationship with the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P10_S0	Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P10_S1	Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P10_S2	Any distributions payable in common shares shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P10_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , we had 19,800 unvested restricted shares outstanding that were granted pursuant to the RSP.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P10_S4	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities We did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act during the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , other than the private offering of Preferred Shares, described below.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P11_S0	On December 22, 2009, we commenced a private offering to accredited investors under Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 of up to $50.0 million in shares of our 8% series A convertible preferred stock (the "Preferred Shares") subject to an option to increase the offering up to $100.0 million in Preferred Shares.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P11_S1	This private offering was terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the registration statement with respect to our common shares.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P11_S2	We had received aggregate gross offering proceeds, net of certain discounts, of $17.0 million from the sale of approximately 2.0 million shares in this private offering.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P11_S3	The Preferred Shares were convertible in whole or in part into shares of common stock after September 2, 2011, the first anniversary of the final closing of the private offering, at a conversion price of $9.00 per share (subject to discounts to a price not less than $8.50).
1474464_13_ITEM5_P11_S4	The Preferred Shares were converted into common shares on December 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P12_S0	The following table reflects the offering costs associated with this issuance of Preferred Shares during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P12_S1	There were no offering costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.

1474464_13_ITEM5_P14_S0	________________________________________________ (1) The Dealer Manager is responsible for commission payments due to their employees as well as its general overhead and various selling related expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P15_S0	Total net offering proceeds received from the issuance of Preferred Shares, after deducting the total expenses paid as described above, were $13.9 million.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P15_S1	We used the net proceeds from this private offering to fund a portion of real estate acquisitions.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P15_S2	Use of Proceeds from Sales of Registered Securities On September 2, 2010, we commenced our IPO on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to the Registration Statement filed with the SEC under the Securities Act.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P15_S3	The Registration Statement also covers up to 25.0 million shares available pursuant to a DRIP under which our common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at the greater of $9.50 per share or 95% of the estimated value of a share of common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P15_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , we had 19.9 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted shares of convertible preferred stock and shares issued under the DRIP.

1474464_13_ITEM5_P16_S0	The following table reflects the offering costs associated with the issuance of common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P17_S0	__________________ (1) The Advisor elected to reimburse our offering costs in excess of 15% of proceeds from the sale of common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P17_S1	This cash reimbursement was paid in April 2012.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P17_S2	The Dealer Manager reallowed the selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , we have incurred $25.7 million of cumulative offering costs in connection with the issuance and distribution of common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P18_S1	Offering proceeds of $177.9 million exceeded cumulative offering costs by $152.2 million at December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM5_P18_S2	The Advisor elected to cap cumulative offering costs incurred by the Company, net of unpaid amounts, to 15% of gross offering proceeds during the offering period.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P18_S3	Cumulative offering costs net of unpaid amounts, were less than the 15% threshold as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM5_P18_S4	Cumulative offering costs include $17.1 million incurred from our Dealer Manager for dealer manager fees and commissions and $2.8 million from our Advisor, net of the Advisor's reimbursement related to the 15% cap on total offering costs.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P19_S0	We have used and expect to continue to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our IPO to primarily acquire high quality, income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P19_S1	We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P19_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we have used the net proceeds from our IPO, secured debt financing and revolving credit facility to purchase 16 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $350.7 million .
1474464_13_ITEM5_P20_S0	Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers Our common stock is currently not listed on a national securities exchange and we will not seek to list our stock until such time as our independent directors believe that the listing of our stock would be in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S0	In order to provide stockholders with the benefit of some interim liquidity, our board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program (the "SRP") that enables our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to significant conditions and limitations.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S1	Our Sponsor, Advisor, directors and affiliates are prohibited from receiving a fee on any share repurchases.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S2	Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at our sole discretion and generally will be made quarterly.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S3	We will limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 st of the previous calendar year (on a ratable basis during each quarterly period during the year).
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S4	In addition, we are only authorized to repurchase shares pursuant to the SRP up to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP and will limit the amount spent to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP in that same quarter.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S5	Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S6	Unless the shares of our common stock are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder's death, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our SRP will be as set forth below until we establish an estimated value of our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S7	We do not currently anticipate obtaining appraisals for our investments (other than investments in transactions with our Sponsor, Advisor, directors or their respective affiliates) and, accordingly, the estimated value of our investments should not be viewed as an accurate reflection of the fair market value of our investments nor will they represent the amount of net proceeds that would result from an immediate sale of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S8	We expect to begin establishing an estimated value of our shares based on the value of our real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of our offering.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P21_S9	We will retain persons independent of us and our Advisor to prepare the estimated value of our shares.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P22_S0	Only those stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions may be able to participate in the SRP.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P22_S1	In other words, once our shares are transferred for value by a stockholder, the transferee and all subsequent holders of the shares are not eligible to participate in the SRP.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P23_S0	We will repurchase shares as of the last business day of each quarter (and in all events on a date other than a dividend payment date).
1474464_13_ITEM5_P23_S1	Prior to establishing the estimated value of our shares, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows:
1474464_13_ITEM5_P24_S0	the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least four years (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_13_ITEM5_P24_S1	Upon the death or disability of a stockholder, upon request, we will waive the one-year holding requirement.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P24_S2	Shares repurchased in connection with the death or disability of a stockholder will be repurchased at a purchase price equal to the price actually paid for the shares during the offering, or if not engaged in the offering, the per share purchase price will be based on the greater of $10.00 or the then-current net asset value of the shares as determined by our board of directors (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_13_ITEM5_P24_S3	In addition, we may waive the holding period in the event of a stockholder's bankruptcy or other exigent circumstances.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P25_S0	The following table summarizes our SRP activity for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
1474464_13_ITEM5_P25_S1	The value of repurchases did not exceed DRIP elections by stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P26_S0	We fund share repurchases from proceeds from the sale of common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P27_S0	_________________________ (1) Includes three unfulfilled repurchase requests consisting of 41,389 shares at an average price per share of $9.25 , which were approved for repurchase as of December 31, 2012 and completed in January 2013.

1474464_13_ITEM5_P28_S1	The following table summarizes repurchase requests pursuant to our SRP for each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2012:
1474464_13_ITEM5_P29_S0	__________________________ (1) Includes three unfulfilled repurchase requests consisting of 41,389 shares at an average price per share of $9.25 , which were approved for repurchase as of December 31, 2012 and completed in January 2013.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P29_S1	The share repurchase program immediately will terminate if our shares are listed on any national securities exchange.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P29_S2	In addition, our board of directors may amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days' prior written notice to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM5_P29_S3	Further, our board of directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any requests for repurchases.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	Organization We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation and qualified as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.

1474464_13_ITEM7_P0_S5	In addition, we sold 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, which terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the Registration Statement.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	On December 15, 2011, we exercised our option to convert the Preferred Shares into 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2012 , the aggregate value of all issuances and subscriptions of common stock outstanding was $198.8 million based on a per share value of $10.00 (or $9.50 for shares issued under the DRIP).
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	We were formed to acquire high quality, income-producing commercial and residential real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	We also may originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	We purchased our first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , we owned 16 properties consisting of 0.6 million rentable square feet, which were 96.0% leased on a weighted average basis with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.5 years.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "OP").
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S6	We retained New York Recovery Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor") to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S7	New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") serves as our property manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S8	Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Dealer Manager") serves as the dealer manager of our IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S9	These related parties are entities wholly owned by American Realty Capital III, LLC (the "Sponsor"), and receive compensation and fees for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P1_S10	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include:
1474464_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Offering and Related Costs Offering and related costs include all expenses incurred in connection with our IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	Offering costs (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fees) include costs that may be paid by the Advisor, the Dealer Manager or their affiliates on our behalf.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	These costs include but are not limited to (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing, and filing fees; (ii) escrow service related fees; (iii) reimbursement of the Dealer Manager for amounts it may pay to reimburse the bona fide diligence expenses of broker-dealers; and (iv) reimbursement to the Advisor for a portion of the costs of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and related offering activities.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	We are obligated to reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for organization and offering costs paid by them on our behalf, provided that the Advisor is obligated to reimburse us to the extent organization and offering costs (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) incurred by us in our offering exceed 1.5% of gross offering proceeds in the IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	As a result, these costs are only our liability to the extent aggregate selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs do not exceed 11.5% of the gross proceeds determined at the end of our IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P4_S3	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Investments in Real Estate Investments in real estate are recorded at cost.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to ten years for fixtures and building improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as "held for sale" on the balance sheet.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	Long-lived assets are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted or when they are designated as held for sale.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	Valuation of real estate is considered a "critical accounting estimate" because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value, and therefore, the carrying amounts, of our real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P8_S4	Additionally, decisions regarding when a property should be classified as held for sale are also highly subjective and require significant management judgment.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Events or changes in circumstances that could cause an evaluation for impairment include the following:
1474464_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	We review our portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate the existence of any of the aforementioned events or changes in circumstances that would require us to test for recoverability.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	In general, our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value expected, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S6	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S7	Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S8	In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P12_S9	We also estimate costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, we initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationships, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from 1 to 28 years .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	We may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Derivatives also may be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued guidance that expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, primarily for Level 3 measurements, which are measurements based on unobservable inputs such as our own data.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	This guidance is largely consistent with current fair value measurement principles with few exceptions that do not result in a change in general practice.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The guidance was applied prospectively and was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P23_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as the guidance relates only to disclosure requirements.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement - referred to as the statement of comprehensive income - or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The new guidance does not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain provisions of this guidance related to the presentation of certain reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income, by component in both the statement and the statement where the reclassification is presented.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	This guidance was applied prospectively and was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations but changed the location of the presentation of other comprehensive income to more closely associate the disclosure with net income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative analysis as the first step in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative analysis for impairment is not required.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	The guidance was effective for interim and annual impairment tests for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities, which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with retrospective application for all comparative periods presented.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	The amendments will allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	The amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Results of Operations As of December 31, 2012 , we owned 16 properties which were 96.0% leased on a weighted average basis, compared to nine properties as of December 31, 2011 , which were 91.0% leased on a weighted average basis.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect significant increases in most categories.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S2	Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2012 to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Rental Income Rental income increased $7.6 million to $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S3	The increase in rental income was primarily driven by our acquisition of 12 properties since January 1, 2011, which resulted in an increase in rental income of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S4	This increase was partially offset by a decrease in rental income at the Interior Design Center ("IDB") of $0.1 million as a result of net lease expirations, amendments and new leasing activity.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S5	New leasing activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012 , however, a full year of the leasing activity has not yet occurred.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S6	IDB's occupancy rate increased to 100.0% at December 31, 2012 from 85.4% at December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S7	Operating Expense Reimbursements Operating expense reimbursements increase $0.3 million to $ 0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , from $ 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S8	Additional operating expense reimbursements of $0.5 million related to acquisitions was partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in operating expense reimbursements at IDB due to lease terminations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S9	Pursuant to many of our lease agreements at IDB, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating expenses in excess of a base amount.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S10	Property operating expenses for new and renewed tenants at IDB were not in excess of their base amounts during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S11	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $1.4 million to $ 2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to $ 1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S12	Additional property operating expense of $1.1 million relates to the real estate taxes, maintenance and insurance costs associated with the 12 properties that have been acquired since January 1, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P29_S13	Additionally, the Advisor absorption of property operating expenses decreased by $0.2 million to $0.3 million from $0.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Operating Fees to Affiliates Our affiliated Property Manager is entitled to fees for the management of our properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Our Property Manager elected to waive these fees for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , we would have incurred property management fees of $0.5 million and $0.2 million , respectively, had these fees not been waived.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	Property management fees will increase in direct correlation with the increase in gross revenues.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S4	Effective July 1, 2012, the payment of asset management fees in cash, shares or restricted stock grants, or any combination thereof to the Advisor was eliminated.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S5	Instead the Company elected to issue to the Advisor Class B units, which will be forfeited unless certain conditions are met.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S6	In December 2012 and January 2013, the board of directors approved the issuance of 43,968 and 72,211 Class B units to the Advisor in connection with this arrangement.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S7	Our Advisor elected to waive these fees prior to July 1, 2012.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S8	We would have incurred asset management fees of $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 , respectively, had these fees not been waived.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S9	Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses Acquisition and transaction related expense of $ 6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 related to the acquisition of the seven properties we purchased during the year for an aggregate base purchase price of $226.5 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P30_S10	Acquisition and transaction related expense of $ 1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the five properties we purchased during the year for an aggregate base purchase price of $57.9 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses remained flat at $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	An increase in board member compensation and professional fees of $0.3 million to support our larger real estate portfolio was offset by a decrease of $0.3 million in the amount of general and administrative expenses that the Advisor elected to absorb.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S2	The Advisor elected to absorb $0.7 million and $0.4 million of general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S3	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased $ 4.1 million to $ 8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S4	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the purchase of 12 properties with an aggregate purchase price of $284.5 million acquired since January 1, 2011, which resulted in additional expense of $4.5 million.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S5	This increase was partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense of in-place lease intangibles of $0.5 million as a result of lease terminations and expirations at IDB.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S6	Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $1.1 million to $ 5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to $ 3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S7	This increase primarily relates to the increase in mortgage notes payable to $185.6 million with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.7% as of December 31, 2012 , compared to $75.3 million with a weighted average effective interest rate of 4.1% as of December 31, 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S8	In addition, since the first advance under our credit facility occurred in May 2012, we incurred interest expense related to our credit facility on an average outstanding balance of $15.2 million with an average variable interest rate of 2.8%.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P31_S9	These increases were partially offset by the reduction in interest expense related to a note payable, which was repaid in full in April 2012 and $0.8 million of defeasance costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2011 related to the defeasance of the original mortgage note payable on the Interior Design Building which occurred in November 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	We view these secured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the level of proceeds raised in our IPO, the cost of borrowings, and the opportunity to acquire real estate assets which meet our investment objectives.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests Net loss of approximately $ 33,000 during the year ended December 31, 2012 represents the net loss on our Bleecker Street portfolio and the 163 Washington Avenue Apartments attributable to non-controlling interest holders.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	Net income of $ 0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 represents net income on our Bleecker Street portfolio attributable to non-controlling interest holders.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2011 to Year Ended December 31, 2010 As of December 31, 2011, we owned nine properties which were approximately 91.0% leased on a weighted average basis.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S5	As of December 31, 2010, we owned four properties, IDB and the Bleecker Street condominiums, which was purchased on June 21, 2010 and December 1, 2010, respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S6	Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 reflect significant increases in most categories.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S7	Rental Income Rental income increased $4.8 million million to $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S8	The increase in rental income was primarily driven by our acquisition of five properties since December 31, 2010 for an aggregate base purchase price of $57.9 million.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S9	Rental income for the year ended December 31, 2010 related solely to IDB and Bleecker Street for the period these properties were owned.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S10	Operating Expense Reimbursement Operating expense reimbursement was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S11	The increase in operating expense reimbursement revenue represents the portion of property real estate taxes and operating expenses which are reimbursable by tenants in the five properties we have acquired since December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S12	Operating expense reimbursement revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 related solely to IDB and Bleecker Street for the period these properties were owned.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P32_S13	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses were $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

1474464_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	Our Advisor and Property Manager elected to waive these fees for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we would have incurred aggregate asset management and property management fees of $0.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, had these fees not been waived.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P33_S3	Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses Acquisition and transaction related expense increased to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	Acquisition and transaction related expenses relate to costs associated with acquisitions and potential acquisitions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $43,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, primarily related to increased board member fees and compensation.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.0 million to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the purchase of five properties acquired since December 31, 2010 for an aggregate purchase price of $57.9 million as well as a write-off of an in-place lease intangible due to a lease termination at IDB.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 related solely to IDB and Bleecker Street for the period these properties were owned.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P34_S5	Interest Expense Interest expense increased by $2.8 million to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

1474464_13_ITEM7_P34_S7	We view these secured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to notes payable and a mortgage note payable used to finance a portion of IDB purchased in June 2010 and Bleecker Street purchased in December 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, which will depend on the level of proceeds raised in our offering, the cost of borrowings, and the opportunity to acquire real estate assets which meet our investment objectives.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Net Loss (Income) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests Net loss (income) of $0.2 million and net loss of $0.1 million attributable to non-controlling interests during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, represents the net income and loss on our Bleecker Street portfolio that is related to non-controlling interest holders.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Bleecker Street, which was purchased in December 2010, had a net loss during the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of acquisition and transaction related expenses.

1474464_13_ITEM7_P36_S6	This cash inflow was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.3 million primarily due to unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis and prepaid real estate taxes.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 of $145.8 million related to $229.1 million for the acquisition of seven properties, which were partially funded with proceeds from mortgage notes payable received at acquisition of $79.2 million and reduced by liabilities assumed at acquisition mainly related to building improvements and leasehold interests of $4.8 million as well as minority interest retained by a seller of $0.4 million .

1474464_13_ITEM7_P38_S13	The level of cash flows provided by operating activities is affected by acquisition and transaction costs incurred, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P38_S14	It is also affected by the receipt of scheduled rent payments.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P38_S15	Cash flows used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 include $1.4 million of acquisition and transaction costs.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P38_S16	Results include a net loss adjusted for non-cash items, which resulted in a cash outflow of $0.8 million (net loss of $1.8 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets of $1.0 million) as well as an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.7 million principally resulting from the prepayment of real estate taxes and unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis and net payments to affiliates of $0.4 million.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P38_S17	This cash outflow was partially offset by a combined increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent of $0.6 million.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P38_S18	Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $30.7 million, relating to the acquisition of IDB and the Bleecker Street condominiums completed in June 2010 and December 2010, respectively.

1474464_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal demands for funds will continue to be for property acquisitions, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses, distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest holders, and for the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	Generally, capital needs for property acquisitions will be met through net proceeds received from the sale of common stock through our ongoing IPO as well as proceeds from our revolving credit facility and through property-level secured financings.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	We also may from time to time enter into other agreements with third parties whereby third parties will make equity investments in specific properties or groups of properties that we acquire.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	Expenditures other than property acquisitions and acquisition and transaction-related costs are expected to be covered by cash flows from operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	We expect to meet our future short-term operating liquidity requirements through a combination of net cash provided by our current property operations and the operations of properties to be acquired in the future, proceeds from the sale of common stock and proceeds from our credit facility and secured mortgage financings.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	Management expects that in the future, as our portfolio matures, our properties will cover operating expenses and the payment of our monthly distribution.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from public and private offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	We expect to continue to raise capital through the sale of our common stock and to utilize the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and proceeds from secured financings and our credit facility to complete future property acquisitions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	As of December 31, 2012 , we had 19.9 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted Preferred Shares and shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	As of December 31, 2012 , we had received gross proceeds of $177.9 million and $17.0 million from the sale of shares of common stock and Preferred Shares, respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	Our board of directors has adopted a share repurchase plan that enables our stockholders to sell their shares to us under limited circumstances.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	At the time a stockholder requests a repurchase, we may, subject to certain conditions, repurchase the shares presented for repurchase for cash to the extent we have sufficient funds available to fund such purchase.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S9	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we received 10 requests to repurchase an aggregate of 81,661 shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase plan.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P40_S10	As of December 31, 2012 , we had 3 unfulfilled repurchase requests of 41,389 shares, at an average price per share of $9.25 , which were completed in January 2013.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	We fund share repurchases from cash flows from the sale of common stock.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any other repurchase requests.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $ 5.4 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	We expect cash flows from operations and the sale of common stock to be used primarily to invest in additional real estate, pay debt service, pay operating expenses and pay stockholder distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	Our Advisor evaluates potential acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets and engages in negotiations with sellers and borrowers on our behalf.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	Investors should be aware that after a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence and negotiation of final binding agreements.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S6	During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from common stock offerings in certain investments that could yield lower returns than the properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P41_S7	These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	In January 2013, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire the fee simple interest in an institutional-quality office building located at 218 West 18th Street in Manhattan.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	The contract purchase price of the property is $112.0 million, exclusive of closing costs.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	The property contains approximately 166,000 rentable square feet and is 84% leased to five tenants.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, our obligation to close upon the acquisition is subject to certain conditions customary to closing.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	Although we believe that the acquisition of the property is probable, there can be no assurance that the acquisition will be consummated.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	We intend to fund this acquisition with proceeds from our IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	We may seek financing on the property at or post-closing from a lender yet to be identified.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P43_S4	There is no assurance that we will be able to secure financing on terms that we deem favorable or at all.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ("FFO"), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1474464_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the "White Paper").
1474464_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indicators exist and if the carrying, or book value, exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P48_S3	However, FFO and modified funds from operations ("MFFO"), as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P48_S4	The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	While other start up entities also may experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after the acquisition activity ceases.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	As disclosed in the prospectus for our offering (the "Prospectus"), we will use the proceeds raised in the offering to acquire properties, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our common stock on a national exchange, a merger or sale of the company or another similar transaction) within three to five years of the completion of the offering.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	Thus, we will not continuously purchase assets and will have a limited life.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association ("IPA"), an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is in place.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our IPO has been completed and our properties have been acquired.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P52_S4	We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P52_S5	Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our IPO and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P52_S6	Investors are cautioned that MFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our offering has been completed and properties have been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which properties are acquired.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations ("Practice Guideline") issued by the IPA in November 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of ongoing operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P56_S1	In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling interests.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are acquired and will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S4	MFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to that of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activities and have similar operating characteristics as us.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S5	Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S6	In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P57_S7	We view both gains and losses from dispositions of assets and fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	As disclosed elsewhere in our Prospectus, the purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares in our offering, and therefore such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S1	We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S2	For example, acquisition costs are funded from the proceeds of our IPO and other financing sources and not from operations.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S3	By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S4	Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S5	By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S6	Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S7	Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S8	Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P60_S9	FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a share of common stock is a stated value and there is no net asset value determination during the offering stage and for a period thereafter.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO or MFFO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	The table below reflects the items deducted or added to net loss in our calculation of FFO and MFFO during the periods presented.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	The table reflects MFFO in the IPA recommended format and MFFO without the straight-line rent adjustment which management also uses as a performance measure.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	Items are presented net of non-controlling interest portions where applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	______________________________ (1) The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	In evaluating investments in real estate, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	Such information would be comparable only for non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P64_S2	By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or third parties.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income and income from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Such fees and expenses are paid in cash, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S3	Such fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S4	Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S5	All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S6	Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of shares in our IPO, and therefore such fees will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S7	(2) Under GAAP, certain intangibles are accounted for at cost and reviewed at least annually for impairment, and certain intangibles are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related assets that are excluded from FFO.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S8	However, because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, management believes that by excluding charges relating to amortization of these intangibles, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P65_S9	(3) Management believes that adjusting for mark-to-market adjustments is appropriate because they may not be reflective of ongoing operations and reflect unrealized impacts on value based only on then-current market conditions, although they may be based upon current operational issues related to an individual property or industry or general market conditions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Mark-to-market adjustments are made for items such as ineffective derivative instruments, certain marketable securities and any other items that GAAP requires we make a mark-to-market adjustment for.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	The need to reflect mark-to-market adjustments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly or annual basis in accordance with GAAP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P66_S2	(4) Under GAAP, rental receipts are allocated to periods using various methodologies.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P66_S3	This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than underlying contract terms.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P66_S4	By adjusting for these items (to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments, providing insight on the contractual cash flows of such lease terms and debt investments, and aligns results with management s analysis of operating performance.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Distributions On September 22, 2010, our board of directors authorized, and we declared, a distribution rate equal to $0.605 per annum per share of common stock, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	The distributions are payable by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , distributions paid to common stockholders totaled $6.7 million inclusive of $3.3 million of the value of common stock issued under the DRIP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P68_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , cash used to pay our distributions was primarily generated from cash flows from operations, common stock issued under the DRIP and proceeds from financings.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P68_S3	We have continued to pay distributions to our stockholders each month since our initial distribution payment in April 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P68_S4	There is no assurance that we will continue to declare distributions at this rate.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P68_S5	The following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to common stockholders for the periods presented:
1474464_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	__________________ (1) Cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes acquisition and transaction related expenses of $6.1 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	The following table compares cumulative distributions paid to cumulative net loss (in accordance with GAAP) for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) through December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	__________________________________ (1) Net loss as defined by GAAP includes the non-cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense as well as costs incurred relating to acquisitions and related transactions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Dilution Our net tangible book value per share is a mechanical calculation using amounts from our balance sheet, and is calculated as (1) total book value of our assets less the net value of intangible assets, (2) minus total liabilities less the net value of intangible liabilities, (3) divided by the total number of shares of common and preferred stock outstanding.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	It assumes that the value of real estate, and real estate related assets and liabilities diminish predictably over time as shown through the depreciation and amortization of real estate investments.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P73_S0	Real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P74_S0	Net tangible book value is used generally as a conservative measure of net worth that we do not believe reflects our estimated value per share.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P74_S1	It is not intended to reflect the value of our assets upon an orderly liquidation in accordance with our investment objectives.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P74_S2	Our net tangible book value reflects dilution in the value of our common and preferred stock from the issue price as a result of (i) operating losses, which reflect accumulated depreciation and amortization of real estate investments, (ii) the funding of distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, and (iii) fees paid in connection with this offering, including commissions, dealer manager fees and other offering costs.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P74_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , our net tangible book value per share was $5.66 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P74_S4	The offering price of shares under our primary offering (ignoring purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers) at December 31, 2012 was $10.00 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P74_S5	Our offering price was not established on an independent basis and bears no relationship to the net value of our assets.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P74_S6	Further, even without depreciation in the value of our assets, the other factors described above with respect to the dilution in the value of our common stock are likely to cause our offering price to be higher than the amount you would receive per share if we were to liquidate at this time.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P75_S0	The payment terms of our loan obligations require principal and interest amounts payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P75_S1	Our loan agreements stipulate that we comply with specific reporting covenants.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P75_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P76_S0	Our Advisor may, with the approval of our independent directors, seek to borrow short-term capital that, combined with secured mortgage financing, exceeds our targeted leverage ratio.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P76_S1	Such short-term borrowings may be obtained from third parties on a case-by-case basis as acquisition opportunities present themselves simultaneous with our capital raising efforts.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P76_S2	We view the use of short-term borrowings, including advances under our revolving credit facility, as an efficient and accretive means of acquiring real estate in advance of raising equity capital.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P76_S3	Accordingly, we can take advantage of buying opportunities as we expand our fundraising activities.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P76_S4	As additional equity capital is obtained, these short-term borrowings and credit facility advances will be repaid.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P76_S5	Our secured debt leverage ratio approximated 52.9% (total secured debt as a percentage of total real estate investments) as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P76_S6	The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM7_P77_S0	______________________ (1) Includes principal of $12.4 million and related interest on the mezzanine notes payable that were repaid in full in January 2013.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P78_S0	The Company entered into a lease agreement related to the acquisition of 350 Bleecker Street similar to a leasehold interest arrangement.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P78_S1	The following table reflects the minimum base rental cash payments due from the Company over the next five years and thereafter under this arrangement.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P78_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes among other items.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P79_S0	Election as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P79_S1	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, and so long as we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S2	We believe we are organized and operated in such a manner as to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S3	Inflation Some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S4	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S5	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S6	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P80_S7	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Related-Party Transactions and Agreements We have entered into agreements with our Sponsor and its wholly owned affiliates whereby we pay certain fees, distributions or reimbursements to our Advisor or its affiliates in connection with acquisition and financing activities, sales of common and preferred stock, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering-related costs.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P81_S1	See Note 11 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P81_S2	In addition, the Partnership Agreement was amended as of December 28, 2012, to allow the special allocation, solely for tax purposes, of excess depreciation deductions of up to $10.0 million to our Advisor, a limited partner of the OP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P81_S3	In connection with this special allocation, our Advisor has agreed to restore a deficit balance in its capital account in the event of a liquidation of the OP and has agreed to provide a guaranty or indemnity of indebtedness of the OP.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P82_S0	Our Advisor is directly or indirectly controlled by certain officers and directors.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements On March 30, 2012, we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of $40.0 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The credit facility contains an "accordion" feature to allow us, under certain circumstances, to increase the aggregate commitments under the credit facility to a maximum of $150.0 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7_P83_S2	The credit facility has a term of 36 months , subject to our right to a 12 -month extension.
1474464_13_ITEM7_P83_S3	The outstanding balance on the credit facility as of December 31, 2012 was $20.0 million and our unused borrowing capacity was $8.3 million , based on the value of the borrowing base properties as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , our debt included fixed-rate secured mortgage notes payable, with a carrying value of $ 185.6 million and a fair value of $ 185.6 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the notes, but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2012 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $1.8 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $1.7 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	At December 31, 2012 our debt included a variable-rate revolving credit facility with a carrying and fair value of $ 20.0 million .
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate credit facility affects interest expense incurred and cash flow.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2012 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate credit facility would increase or decrease our interest expense by $0.2 million annually.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2012 , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of such period, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act.
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	In connection with the preparation of our Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P0_S3	In making that assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2012 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P0_S5	The rules of the SEC do not require, and this annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding, internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1474464_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_13_ITEM10_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to our annual proxy statement to be filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 (the "Proxy Statement").

1474464_13_ITEM15_P7_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P7_S7	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P7_S8	Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P7_S9	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P8_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P8_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P15_S5	In addition, the Company sold 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act (the "Preferred Offering"), which terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the Registration Statement.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P15_S6	On December 15, 2011, the Company exercised its option to convert the Preferred Shares into 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P15_S7	As of December 31, 2012 , the aggregate value of all issuances and subscriptions of common stock outstanding was $198.8 million based on a per share value of $10.00 (or $9.50 for shares issued under the DRIP).
1474464_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	The Company was formed to acquire high quality, income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by the Company alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P16_S2	The Company may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P16_S3	The Company purchased its first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P16_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company owned 16 properties consisting of 0.6 million rentable square feet, which were 96.0% leased on a weighted average basis with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.5 years.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "OP"), a Delaware limited partnership.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P17_S1	The Company has no paid employees.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P17_S2	The Company has retained New York Recovery Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor") to manage its affairs on a day-to-day basis.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P17_S3	New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") serves as the Company's property manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P17_S4	Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Dealer Manager") serves as the dealer manager of the IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P17_S5	These related parties are entities wholly owned by American Realty Capital III, LLC (the "Sponsor") and receive compensation and fees for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of the Company's assets.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P17_S6	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1474464_13_ITEM15_P18_S1	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P18_S2	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	In determining whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, authority to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the other partners or members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, real estate taxes and derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	Real Estate Investments Investments in real estate are recorded at cost.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P23_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P23_S2	Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to 15 years for fixtures and capital improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company is required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as "held for sale" on the balance sheet.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Assets The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S2	The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S4	Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third-parties or the Company's analysis of comparable properties in its portfolio.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S5	Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S6	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S7	Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S8	In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P28_S9	Estimates of costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses are also utilized.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P30_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values will be amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationship, as applicable, is measured based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and its overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	Characteristics considered in determining these values include the nature and extent of the existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from one to 28 years .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P33_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P33_S2	If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P34_S1	The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P34_S2	Intangible assets and acquired lease liabilities consist of the following:
1474464_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	The following table provides the weighted-average amortization and accretion periods as of December 31, 2012 , for intangible assets and liabilities and the projected amortization expense and adjustments to revenues for the next five years:
1474464_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	The Company deposits cash with high quality financial institutions.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P37_S2	These deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the "FDIC") up to an insurance limit.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P37_S3	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 the Company had deposits of $5.4 million and $10.2 million , respectively, of which $3.3 million and $9.0 million , respectively, were in excess of the amount insured by the FDIC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P37_S4	Although the Company bears risk to amounts in excess of those insured by the FDIC, it does not anticipate any losses as a result.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves related to lease expirations as well as maintenance, structural, and debt service reserves as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	Deferred Costs, Net Deferred costs, net consists of deferred financing costs and deferred leasing costs.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P38_S3	These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P38_S4	Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P38_S5	Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Deferred leasing costs, consisting primarily of lease commissions and payments made to assume existing leases, are deferred and amortized over the term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Share Repurchase Program The Company's board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program ("SRP") that enables stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in limited circumstances.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	The SRP permits investors to sell their shares back to the Company after they have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described below.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	Prior to the time that the Company's shares are listed on a national securities exchange and until the Company establishes an estimated value for the shares, the purchase price per share will depend on the length of time investors have held such shares as follows: after one year from the purchase date the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after two years from the purchase date the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after three years from the purchase date the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; and after four years from the purchase date the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the amount they actually paid for each share (in each case, as adjusted for any stock distributions, combinations, splits and recapitalizations).
1474464_13_ITEM15_P40_S3	The Company will begin establishing an estimated value for its shares based on the value of its real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of its offering.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	Beginning 18 months after the completion of the last offering of the Company's shares (excluding offerings under the DRIP), the board of directors will determine the value of the properties and the other assets based on such information as the board determines appropriate, which may or may not include independent valuations of properties or of the Company as a whole, prepared by third-party service providers.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	The Company is only authorized to repurchase shares pursuant to the SRP up to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP and will limit the amount spent to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP in that same quarter.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P43_S1	In addition, the board of directors may reject a request for redemption, at any time.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P43_S2	Due to these limitations, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P43_S3	Purchases under the SRP by the Company will be limited in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior year (or 1.25% per calendar quarter).
1474464_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	When a stockholder requests repurchases and the repurchases are approved by the Company's board of directors, it will reclassify such obligation from equity to a liability based on the settlement value of the obligation.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	The following table reflects the number of shares repurchased for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P44_S2	There were no repurchases requested or fulfilled during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	__________________________ Distribution Reinvestment Plan Pursuant to the DRIP, stockholders may elect to reinvest distributions by purchasing shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	No dealer manager fees or selling commissions are paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P45_S2	Participants purchasing shares pursuant to the DRIP have the same rights and are treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the IPO.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	The board of directors may designate that certain cash or other distributions be excluded from the DRIP.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company has the right to amend any aspect of the DRIP or terminate the DRIP with ten days' notice to participants.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P47_S0	Shares issued under the DRIP are recorded to equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the period distributions are declared.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	Derivative Instruments The Company may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P48_S1	Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P49_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P50_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P50_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P50_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P51_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P52_S1	The accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P52_S2	If the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P52_S3	If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P52_S4	Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P53_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company's revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	Since many of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P54_S3	When the Company acquires a property, the term of existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P54_S4	The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P54_S5	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in the consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P55_S0	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P56_S0	Offering and Related Costs Offering costs (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) of the Company may be paid by the Advisor, the Dealer Manager or their affiliates on behalf of the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P56_S1	Such offering costs include all expenses to be paid by the Company in connection with its offering, including but not limited to (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing, and filing fees; (ii) escrow related fees; (iii) reimbursement of the Dealer Manager for amounts it may pay to reimburse the bona fide diligence expenses of broker-dealers; and (iv) reimbursement to the Advisor for the salaries of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and related offering activities.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	The Company is obligated to reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for organization and offering costs paid by them on behalf of the Company, provided that the Advisor is obligated to reimburse the Company to the extent organization and offering costs (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) incurred by the Company in its offering exceed 1.5% of gross offering proceeds.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P56_S3	As a result, these costs are only a liability of the Company to the extent selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs do not exceed 11.5% of the gross proceeds determined at the end of offering (See Note 11 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements ).
1474464_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company has a stock-based incentive award plan for its directors, which is accounted for under the guidance of share based payments.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	The expense for such awards is included in general and administrative expenses and is recognized over the vesting period or when the requirements for exercise of the award have been met.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	(See Note 13 Share-Based Compensation ).
1474464_13_ITEM15_P58_S0	Income Taxes The Company made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2010.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P58_S1	If the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income to its stockholders, and so long as it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P59_S1	Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	Per Share Data Income (loss) per basic share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) less distributions declared on Preferred Shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments, such as stock options and unvested restricted stock, but uses the average share price for the period in determining the number of incremental shares that are to be added to the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P62_S0	Reportable Segments The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company's investments in real estate generate rental revenue and other income through the leasing of properties, which comprised 100% of total consolidated revenues.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P63_S0	Management evaluates the operating performance of the Company's investments in real estate on an individual property level.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued guidance that expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, primarily for Level 3 measurements, which are measurements based on unobservable inputs such as the Company's own data.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P64_S1	This guidance is largely consistent with current fair value measurement principles with few exceptions that do not result in a change in general practice.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P64_S2	The guidance was applied prospectively and was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P64_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations as the guidance relates only to disclosure requirements.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance requiring entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement - referred to as the statement of comprehensive income - or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P65_S1	The new guidance does not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P65_S2	In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain provisions of this guidance related to the presentation of certain reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income, by component in both the statement and the statement where the reclassification is presented.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P65_S3	This guidance was applied prospectively and was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P65_S4	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations but changed the location of the presentation of other comprehensive income to more closely associate the disclosure with net income.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	In September 2011, the FASB issued guidance that allows entities to perform a qualitative analysis as the first step in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P66_S1	If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative analysis for impairment is not required.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P66_S2	The guidance was effective for interim and annual impairment tests for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P66_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P67_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities, which requires entities to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P67_S1	The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with retrospective application for all comparative periods presented.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P67_S2	The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P68_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P68_S1	The amendments will allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P68_S2	An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P68_S3	The amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P68_S4	The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P74_S0	The following table presents future minimum base rent cash payments due to the Company subsequent to December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P74_S1	These amounts exclude contingent rental payments, as applicable, that may be collected from certain tenants based on provisions related to sales thresholds and increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes among other items.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P75_S0	The following table lists the tenants whose annualized rental income on a straight-line basis represented greater than 10% of total annualized rental income for all portfolio properties on a straight-line basis as of December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 :
1474464_13_ITEM15_P76_S0	__________________________ * Tenant's annualized rental income on a straight-line basis was not greater than 10% of total annualized rental income for all portfolio properties as of the period specified.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P76_S1	The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of the above tenants may have a material adverse effect on revenues.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P76_S2	No other tenant represents more than 10% of annualized rental income as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P77_S0	Note 4 Revolving Credit Facility On March 30, 2012, the Company entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of $40.0 million .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P77_S1	The credit facility contains an "accordion" feature to allow the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility to a maximum of $150.0 million .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P77_S2	The credit facility has a term of 36 months , subject to the Company's right to a 12 -month extension.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P77_S3	The credit facility generally bears interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.50% , subject to adjustment as set forth in the credit agreement, and includes an unused commitment fee per annum of (a) 0.2% if the unused balance of the facility is equal to or less than 50% of the available facility and (b) 0.3% if the unused balance of the facility exceeds 50% of the available facility.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P77_S4	The outstanding balance on the credit facility as of December 31, 2012 was $20.0 million with an interest rate of 2.7% and the unused borrowing capacity, based on the value of the borrowing base properties as of December 31, 2012 , was $8.3 million .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P77_S5	The credit facility provides for monthly interest payments, with all principal outstanding being due on the maturity date in March 2015.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P77_S6	The credit facility may be prepaid from time to time and at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to reimbursement of certain costs and expenses.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P78_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The credit facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company was in compliance with the debt covenants under the credit facility agreement.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P80_S0	Note 5 Notes Payable To fund the acquisition of the Interior Design Building, the Company entered into note agreements totaling $8.9 million with two unaffiliated third party investors.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P80_S1	The notes each had an annual interest rate of 9.0% .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P80_S2	The repayment of the notes required a 1.0% exit fee based on the original note proceeds payable upon the maturities of the respective notes and were pre-payable at any time.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P80_S3	In 2010, the terms of the notes were modified from a maturity date of January 1, 2011 to pay interest-only on a monthly basis and to repay the remaining principal balance upon maturity on June 30, 2012.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P80_S4	The note holders had the option, but did not elect to demand payment of 50.0% of the principal balance on July 15, 2011.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P80_S5	As of December 31, 2011 , $5.9 million of the notes payable was outstanding.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P82_S0	Note 6 Mortgage Notes Payable The Company's mortgage notes payable as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 consist of the following:
1474464_13_ITEM15_P83_S0	______________________ (1) Fixed through an interest rate swap agreement.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P83_S1	(2) Mezzanine loans collateralized by the 256 West 38th Street and 229 West 36th Street properties, respectively.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P83_S2	The mezzanine loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 5% through July 2013 and LIBOR plus 8% thereafter.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P83_S3	These mezzanine loans were repaid in full in January 2013.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P84_S0	(3) Calculated on a weighted average basis for all mortgages outstanding as of December 31, 2012 .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P85_S0	The Company's sources of secured financing generally require financial covenants, including restrictions on corporate guarantees, the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of minimum net worth.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , the Company was in compliance with the debt covenants under the mortgage note agreements.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P85_S2	The following table summarizes the scheduled aggregate principal repayments subsequent to December 31, 2012 :
1474464_13_ITEM15_P86_S0	Note 7 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P86_S1	This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P88_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P88_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P89_S2	The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P89_S3	However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P89_S4	Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P89_S5	However, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's derivatives.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P89_S6	As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	The valuation of derivative instruments is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P90_S2	In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company's potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the counterparties.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	The following table presents information about the Company's liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall:
1474464_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	A review of the fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P93_S1	There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P95_S1	The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, due from affiliates, notes payable, accounts payable and distributions payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheet due to their short-term nature.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P95_S2	The fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet are reported below.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	The fair value of mortgage notes payable is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Advisor's experience with similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	The carrying value of the revolving credit facility is deemed to approximate the fair value since the floating interest rate on advances is based on a market rate.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	Note 8 Derivatives and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P97_S2	The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative or other purposes other than interest rate risk management.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P97_S3	The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are not able to perform under the agreements.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P97_S4	To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P97_S5	The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P98_S0	Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P98_S1	To accomplish this objective, the Company may primarily use interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P99_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P99_S1	Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the floor strike rate on the contract.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P99_S2	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P99_S3	During 2012 and 2011, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P100_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company recorded approximately $14,000 and $3,000 of hedge ineffectiveness in earnings, respectively, due to a timing mismatch of the debt closing.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P100_S2	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company's variable-rate debt.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P100_S3	During the next 12 months the Company estimates that an additional $0.9 million will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P103_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1474464_13_ITEM15_P104_S0	Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships The table below details the location in the financial statements of the gain or loss recognized on interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_13_ITEM15_P105_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P105_S1	These derivatives are used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements to be classified as hedging instruments.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P180_S3	Regulation FD provides that: (1) whenever a reporting company (or a person acting on its behalf), (a) discloses material nonpublic information, (b) to securities market professionals (including broker-dealers, investment advisors, investment companies, hedge funds and others) or to holders of the company s securities who may well trade on the basis of such information, (2) then the reporting company must make public disclosure of that same information: (a) simultaneously (for intentional disclosures) or (b) promptly (for non-intentional disclosures).
1474464_13_ITEM15_P181_S0	We and other publicly registered companies routinely rely on this exception by utilizing confidentiality agreements.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P182_S0	The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ) has made several observations that should prove very instructive to employees when navigating the limitations imposed by Regulation FD, including the following: 1.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P182_S1	Senior officials of issuers should be particularly cautious during private conversations with analysts, broker-dealers, and due diligence professionals.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P183_S0	When communicating with securities industry professionals, issuers may not use code words to selectively disclose information that they could not selectively disclose expressly.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P183_S1	The Company obviously cannot allow activity by any of its officers or employees that violates Regulation FD.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P183_S2	The Company s policies are designed to ensure that (1) the Company does not violate Regulation FD and (2) the risk that there is any appearance of Regulation FD violations by the Company is minimized.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P183_S4	The following exceptions are obviously applicable: (1) the appropriate officers of the Company (such as the Chairman, General Counsel, CEO, COO, and Chief Financial Officer may have discussions with, and disclose confidential information to, lenders, potential lenders, internal and external auditors, and their representatives who are not shareholders in accordance with standard industry practices and who need such information in connection with their existing or proposed financings; and (2) subject to any parameters set from time to time by the Company s General Counsel, CEO or COO, disclosures may be made by the appropriate officers to persons or institutions that are party to an effective, written confidentiality agreement negotiated by the Company s General Counsel, COO or other legal counsel approved by the General Counsel or COO.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P184_S0	Insider Trading of Securities It is each employee s responsibility to make sure that any trading in the Company s securities by him or her is handled in a manner which complies with the Company s policies and all applicable laws.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P184_S2	Even after advance notice is given and approval received, as soon as possible on the same day as the trade, you must inform the Company s COO or General Counsel in writing of the number of shares purchased, sold or otherwise affected, the date of the transactions, and the price per share, as well as provide any other information relating to the transaction which he may request.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P184_S3	If the COO or General Counsel is out of the office or otherwise unavailable, copies of the foregoing material should be sent simultaneously to the Company s outside corporate legal counsel.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P184_S5	This prohibition continues until the information has been made available to the public for at least three trading days.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P185_S0	Material, non-public information includes information that is not available to the general public which could affect the market price of the Company s shares and to which a reasonable investor would attach importance in deciding whether to buy, sell or hold Company securities.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P185_S1	Common examples of material, non-public information are: (1) estimates or projections of earnings or results of operations for current or future earnings or results of operations for current or future periods; (2) news of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition, sale, or tender offer or other significant transaction, lease, lease termination or bankruptcy of a significant tenant; or (3) changes in dividend distributions or policies.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P185_S2	Such information is material whether it is negative or positive information.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P185_S3	Information is considered to be available to the general public only when it has been released to the public through a press release or other authorized channels.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P185_S4	It is assumed that it will take the investment market up to three trading days to absorb and evaluate the information.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P185_S5	If you have any questions as to whether information is material, non-public information, please do not hesitate to call the COO or General Counsel of the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P186_S0	No employee of the Company or any member of his or her immediate family living in his or her household may buy or sell Company shares during the period beginning on the last day of each fiscal quarter or fiscal year (i.e. March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year) and ending three full trading days after the public release by the Company of its financial results for such fiscal quarter or year.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P186_S1	This means that, prior to buying or selling Company shares, you must first determine whether financial results have been released to the public for the immediately preceding quarter or year, as applicable.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P187_S0	information can be obtained from the Company s Vice President of Corporate Accounting, COO or General Counsel.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P187_S1	Every employee is required to strictly comply with the foregoing requirements.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P187_S2	You should be aware that trading securities in the Company with the knowledge of material, non-public information is not only a violation of the foregoing requirements, which may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, but is also a violation of law that carries strict penalties.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P188_S0	Conflicts of Interest It is very important for all employees to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P188_S1	Any time such conflict appears, or an employee is concerned that such a conflict might develop, the employee is required to discuss the matter with his or her manager, department head or the General Counsel, CEO or COO.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P188_S2	Each employee is expected to avoid any action or involvement which would in any way compromise his or her actions on behalf of the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P188_S3	Some examples of clear conflict of interest situations which should always be avoided include the following:
1474464_13_ITEM15_P189_S0	Transactions with outside firms must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the executive level of the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P189_S1	Business dealings with outside firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P189_S2	Unusual gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks and other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit either the employer, the employee or both.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P189_S3	Promotional plans that could be interpreted to involve unusual gain require specific executive level approval.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P190_S0	No presumption of guilt is created by the mere existence of a relationship with outside firms.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P190_S1	However, if an employee has any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts or leases, it is imperative that he or she disclose to the Company as soon as possible the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S0	Every employee is prohibited from partaking in any activity or association that creates or appears to create a conflict between the employee s personal interests and the Company s business interests.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S1	In addition, an employee must not allow any situation or personal interest to interfere with the exercise of independent judgment or with that employee s ability to act in the best interests of the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S2	A conflict involving any executive officer or a Director will be reviewed directly by the Board or the Conflicts Committee of the Board, as appropriate.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S3	Conflicts involving any other employee of the Company will be reviewed by the employee s supervisor or local human resources representative, General Counsel or outside counsel after full disclosure by the employee.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S4	In certain limited cases, activities giving rise to potential conflicts of interest may be waived and permitted if they are determined not to be harmful to the Company.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S5	That determination will be made by the Board or the Conflicts Committee of the Board, as appropriate, in the case of any executive officer or Director, and by the applicable supervisor or the local human resources representative and the Company s General Counsel or outside counsel.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S6	Conflicts of interest may not always be apparent, so if an employee has a question, the employee should consult with his or her supervisor or local human resources representative or the Company s General Counsel or outside counsel, who will assist in determining if there is a conflict and, if so, how to resolve it without compromising the Company s interests.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P191_S7	Prompt and full disclosure is always the appropriate first step towards identifying and resolving any potential conflict of interest or problem.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P192_S0	Any employee who becomes aware of a conflict or potential conflict should bring it to the attention of a supervisor, local human resources representative or the Company s General Counsel, CEO or COO.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P192_S1	Please consult the procedures described in this Code under Compliance Procedures when confronted with a conflict or potential conflict.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P194_S4	Any employee who discloses Confidential and Proprietary Information may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including possible termination of employment and legal action, even if he or she does not actually benefit from disclosure of such information.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P195_S0	Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be deemed to prevent the employee from utilizing his or her general knowledge, intellect, experience, and skills for gainful employment after termination of employment with the Company; provided, that this sentence shall not relieve any current or former Company employee from any obligations he or she may have pursuant to an effective non-compete agreement with the Company.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P197_S2	It is the Company s policy to compete fairly and legitimately and to comply with the applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P197_S3	These laws may prohibit agreements and practices in restraint of trade such as price fixing, boycotting suppliers or customers, predatory pricing intended to run a competitor out of business, unfair competition, and attempts to monopolize.
1474464_13_ITEM15_P197_S4	The purpose of these laws is to promote vigorous, free, and open competition in the marketplace and violations may result in severe penalties for the Company and individual employees, including substantial fines and even prison sentences.

1474464_13_ITEM15_P211_S0	The undersigned, who are the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. (the Company ), each hereby certify as follows:
1474464_13_ITEM15_P212_S0	The annual report on Form 10-K of the Company which accompanies this Certificate, fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and all information contained in this annual report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Our growth will partially depend upon our ability to successfully acquire future properties, and we may be unable to enter into and consummate property acquisitions on advantageous terms or our property acquisitions may not perform as we expect.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities particularly for properties located in New York City.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The competition may significantly increase the price we pay and reduce the returns that we earn.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In particular, larger REITs may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Because of an increased interest in single-property acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	we may acquire properties without recourse, or with only limited recourse, for liabilities, whether known or unknown, such as cleanup of environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We rely on our Advisor to acquire properties on our behalf.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Because the management personnel of our Advisor are also engaged in the process of acquiring properties for other entities formed and managed by affiliates of our Advisor, we could suffer delays in locating suitable investments or may miss out on opportunities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If our Advisor is unable to obtain further suitable investments, we will not be able to continue to increase our asset base.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If tenants do not renew their leases upon expiration, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Even if the tenants do re-lease the lease or we are able to re-lease to a new tenant, the terms and conditions of the new lease may not be as favorable as the terms and conditions of the expired lease.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	In addition, one or more of our properties may incur a vacancy either by the continued default of a tenant under its lease or the expiration of one of our leases.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The resale value of a property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend principally upon the value of the cash flow generated from the property which in the case of vacancies, will be reduced.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our properties may be subject to impairment charges.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We periodically evaluate our real estate investments for impairment indicators.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, tenant performance and legal structure.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	For example, the early termination of, or default under, a lease by a tenant may lead to an impairment charge.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make a downward adjustment to the net carrying value of the property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Impairment charges also indicate a potential permanent adverse change in the fundamental operating characteristics of the impaired property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P5_S7	There is no assurance that these adverse changes will be reversed in the future and the decline in the impaired property s value could be permanent.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and therefore we may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Investments in real properties are relatively illiquid.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We may not be able to quickly alter our portfolio or generate capital by selling properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If we need or desire to sell a property or properties, we cannot predict whether we will be able to do so at a price or on the terms and conditions acceptable to us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Further, we may be required to invest monies to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S6	We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct these defects or to make these improvements.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Moreover, in acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S8	These provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S9	In addition, applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") impose restrictions on the ability of a REIT to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Thus, we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing a property at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S11	There is no public trading market for our shares and there may never be one.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S12	Our shares are not listed on a national securities exchange and there currently is no established trading market for our shares and no assurance that one will develop.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S13	Even though we intend to file an application to list our shares on a national securities exchange, there is no assurance that our shares will in fact be listed or of the price at which the shares would trade or the volume that would develop.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S14	Unless our shares are listed, purchasers in so-called secondary market transactions must satisfy applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards and the sale must not violate state securities laws.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P7_S15	Those requirements may further limit the ability of stockholders to sell shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We or our Advisor may be unable to obtain key personnel.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain of our executive officers and other key personnel of our Advisor, including Nicholas S. Schorsch and Edward M. Weil, Jr.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We cannot guarantee that all, or any particular one of these key personnel, will remain affiliated with our Advisor or become our employees if we become self-managed by internalizing the functions performed by our Advisor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We do not separately maintain key person life insurance on Messrs. Schorsch and Weil, or any other person.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Failure to retain these key employees or the Advisor's failure to hire and retain highly skilled managerial operational and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objectives, lessen or eliminate the benefits of becoming self-managed and could result could result in us incurring excess costs and suffering deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Further, because these persons have competing demands on their time and resources, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our business and these other activities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We may be unable to pay or maintain distributions from cash available from operations or increase distributions over time.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	There are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash distributions to stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Distributions are based principally on cash available from our operations, but we may be required to borrow funds or sell assets to fund distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Actual cash available for distributions may vary substantially from estimates.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	There is no assurance that we will be able to pay or maintain our current level of distributions or that distributions will increase over time.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Distributions funded from anything other than cash flow from operations reduces the amount of capital available to invest in properties and other permitted investments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	These changes may impact our profitability and ability to realize growth in the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	vacancies and inability to lease or sublease space; changes in tax, real estate, environmental and zoning laws; and periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Tenant credit concentrations make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to those tenants.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2013, Cravath, Swaine Moore, LLP, Nomura Holdings America, Inc., Macy's, Inc., RentPath, Inc., and The Segal Company (Eastern States), Inc. represented us 18.2%, 12.4%, 7.4%, 6.2% and 5.8%, respectively, of rental income on a straight-line basis.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The financial failure or an adverse change in the tenant's financial condition or credit rating of any of these tenants would, therefore, likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition and the value of our investments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to pay distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	A bankruptcy filing by one of our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	There is no assurance the tenant or its trustee would agree to assume the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages and it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P14_S8	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments that would mean a reduction in our cash flow and the amount available to pay distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	If a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a tenant's bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition and ability to make distributions to you could be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may enter into sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we would purchase a property and then lease the same property back to the person from whom we purchased it.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	In the event of the bankruptcy of a tenant, a transaction structured as a sale- leaseback may be re-characterized as either a financing or a joint venture, either of which outcomes could adversely affect our business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P16_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a financing, we might not be considered the owner of the property, and as a result would have the status of a creditor in relation to the tenant.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In that event, we would no longer have the right to sell or encumber our ownership interest in the property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Instead, we would have a claim against the tenant for the amounts owed under the lease, with the claim arguably secured by the property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The tenant/debtor might have the ability to propose a plan restructuring the term, interest rate and amortization schedule of its outstanding balance.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we could be bound by the new terms, and prevented from foreclosing our lien on the property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re- characterized as a joint venture, our lessee and we could be treated as co-venturers with regard to the property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, we could be held liable, under some circumstances, for debts incurred by the lessee relating to the property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may suffer losses that are not covered by insurance or that are in excess of insurance coverage, we could lose invested capital and anticipated profits.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our general liability coverage, property insurance coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties may not be adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense Similarly, we may not have adequate coverage against the risk of direct physical damage or to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	There are also certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Also, insuring against potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Additionally, mortgage lenders in some cases have begun to insist that commercial property owners purchase specific coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S3	These insurance policies may or may not be available, or available at reasonable cost.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In these instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for any distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Additionally, our tenants' operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties, may affect our properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S8	In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply, and that may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S9	State and federal laws in this are constantly evolving, and we may be affected by such changes and be required to comply with new laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of most properties that we acquire; however, we will not obtain an independent third-party environmental assessment for every property we acquire.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P19_S10	In addition, any such assessment that we do obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities or that a prior owner of a property did not create a material environmental condition not known to us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may be required to spend substantial sums defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of co-venturers and disputes between us and our co-venturers.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We may enter into other partnerships and co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments).
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding such joint ventures.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their required capital contributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	These investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the co-venturer would have full control over the joint venture.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Disputes between us and co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Consequently, actions by or disputes with co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P22_S5	In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our co-venturers.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Potential changes in U.S. accounting standards regarding operating leases may make the leasing of our properties less attractive to our potential tenants, which could reduce overall demand for our leasing services.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Under current authoritative accounting guidance for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant's balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting and have jointly released exposure drafts of a proposed accounting model that would significantly change lease accounting.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	These changes may affect how the real estate leasing business is conducted.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	This in turn could make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Our costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Our properties will be subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "Disabilities Act").
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S8	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial facilities" that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P24_S9	The Disabilities Act's requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties in compliance with the Disabilities Act or allocate the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with the Disabilities Act.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for our internal information technology systems, our systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	We may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S6	The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S7	A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P25_S8	More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and private data exposure.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We have implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Risks Associated with Real Estate-Related Debt and Other Investments Any real estate debt security that we originate or purchase is subject to the risks of delinquency and foreclosure.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We may originate and purchase real estate debt securities, which are subject to numerous risks including delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Typically, we will not have recourse to the personal assets of our borrowers.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The ability of a borrower to repay a real estate debt security secured by an income-producing property depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property, rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We bear the risks of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the real estate debt security, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower, the real estate debt security to that borrower will be deemed to be collateralized only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the real estate debt security will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Foreclosure of a real estate debt security can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed real estate debt security.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We also may be forced to foreclose on certain properties, be unable to sell these properties and be forced to incur substantial expenses to improve operations at the property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, the value of mortgage loan investments is impacted by changes in the value of underlying collateral (if any), interest rates, volatility and prepayment rates, among other things.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	mezzanine loans investments may be even more volatile because, among other things, the senior lender may be able to exercise remedies that protect the senior lenders but that result in us losing our investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Any hedging strategies we utilize may not be successful in mitigating our risks.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We may enter into hedging transactions to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	To the extent that we use derivative financial instruments in connection with these risks, we will be exposed to credit, basis and legal enforceability risks.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Derivative financial instruments may include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In this context, credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Basis risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual risks, including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative contract.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We may not be able to manage these risks effectively.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	We may invest in collateralized mortgage-backed securities, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk and the risks of the securitization process.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	We may invest in CMBS, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We have not adopted, and do not expect to adopt, any formal policies or procedures designed to manage risks associated with our investments in CMBS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In this context, credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Interest rate risk occurs as prevailing market interest rates change relative to the current yield on the CMBS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	For example, when interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their existing mortgages to take advantage of the lower cost of financing.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	As prepayments occur, principal is returned to the holders of the CMBS sooner than expected, thereby lowering the effective yield on the investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	On the other hand, when interest rates rise, borrowers are more likely to maintain their existing mortgages.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P36_S4	As a result, prepayments decrease, thereby extending the average maturity of the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	CMBS are also subject to several risks created through the securitization process.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Subordinate CMBS are paid interest only to the extent that there are funds available to make payments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	To the extent the collateral pool includes delinquent loans, there is a risk that the interest payment on subordinate CMBS will not be fully paid.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Subordinate CMBS are also subject to greater credit risk than those CMBS that are more highly rated.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions to you will be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationships with our Advisor and its affiliates, including the material conflicts discussed below.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Our Advisor faces conflicts of interest relating to the purchase and leasing of properties, and these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect our investment opportunities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Affiliates of our Advisor have sponsored and may sponsor one or more other real estate investment programs in the future.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may buy properties at the same time as one or more of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs managed by officers and key personnel of our Advisor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	There is a risk that our Advisor will choose a property that provides lower returns to us than a property purchased by another American Realty Capital-sponsored program.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S3	We cannot be sure that officers and key personnel acting on behalf of our Advisor and on behalf of managers of other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs will act in our best interests when deciding whether to allocate any particular property to us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S4	In addition, we may acquire properties in geographic areas where other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs own properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S5	In such a case, a conflict could arise in the acquisition or leasing of properties if we and another American Realty Capital-sponsored program were to compete for the same properties or tenants in negotiating leases, or a conflict could arise in connection with the resale of properties if we and another American Realty Capital-sponsored program were to attempt to sell similar properties at the same time.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S6	Conflicts of interest also may exist at such time as we or our affiliates managing properties on our behalf seek to employ developers, contractors or building managers, as well as under other circumstances.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S7	Also, we may acquire properties from, or sell properties to, other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S8	If one of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs attracts a tenant that we are competing for, we could suffer a loss of revenue due to delays in locating another suitable tenant.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S9	Similar conflicts of interest may apply if our Advisor determines to make or purchase mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or participations therein on our behalf, since other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs may be competing with us for these investments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S10	The management of multiple REITs, especially REITs in the development stage, by our executive officers and officers of our Advisor may significantly reduce the amount of time our executive officers and officers of our Advisor are able to spend on activities related to us and may cause other conflicts of interest, which may cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P40_S11	Our executive officers and officers of our Advisor are part of the senior management or are key personnel of the other American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs and their advisors.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Five of the American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs, including ARC Realty Finance Trust, Inc., American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust II, Inc., American Realty Capital Trust V, Inc., Phillips Edison - ARC Grocery Center REIT II, Inc. and American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust, Inc. have registration statements that became effective in the past 18 months and currently are offering securities and none of the American Realty Capital-sponsored REITs are more than five years old.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	As a result, such REITs will have concurrent or overlapping acquisition, operational and disposition and liquidation phases as us, which may cause conflicts of interest to arise throughout each phase of our company with respect to, among other things, locating and acquiring properties, entering into leases and disposing of properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The conflicts of interest each of our executive officers and each officer of our Advisor face may cause our operating results and the value of our investments to suffer.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Officers of any service provider may face similar conflicts of interest should they be involved with the management of multiple REITs, and especially REITs in the developmental stage.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Our officers and directors face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with affiliated entities, which could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to generate returns to you.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Certain of our executive officers, including Nicholas S. Schorsch, who also serves as the chairman of our board of directors, and Edward M. Weil, Jr., president, chief operating officer and secretary, also are officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager and other affiliated entities, including the advisor and property manager of other REITs sponsored by the American Realty Capital group of companies.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S6	As a result, these individuals owe fiduciary duties to these other entities and their stockholders and limited partners, which fiduciary duties may conflict with the duties that they owe to us and our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Their loyalties to these other entities could result in actions or inactions that are detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our investment and leasing opportunities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P41_S8	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of new investments and management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) our purchase of properties from, or sale of properties, to affiliated entities, (c) the timing and terms of the investment in or sale of an asset, (d) development of our properties by affiliates, (e) investments with affiliates of our Advisor, (f) compensation to our Advisor, and (g) our relationship with our Property Manager.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the incentive fee structure, including New York Recovery Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the "Special Limited Partner"), which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Under our advisory agreement and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership, our Advisor and its affiliates, including the Special Limited Partner, are entitled to fees and distributions that are structured in a manner intended to provide incentives to our Advisor to perform in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	However, because our Advisor does not maintain a significant equity interest in us and is entitled to receive substantial minimum compensation regardless of performance, our Advisor's interests are not wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In that regard, our Advisor could be motivated to recommend riskier or more speculative investments in order for us to generate the specified levels of performance or sales proceeds that would entitle our Advisor to fees.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	In addition, our Advisor's and its affiliates' entitlement to fees and distributions upon the sale of our assets and to participate in sale proceeds could result in our Advisor recommending sales of our investments at the earliest possible time at which sales of investments would produce the level of return that would entitle the Advisor to compensation relating to those sales, even if continued ownership of those investments might be in our best long-term interest.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S5	The partnership agreement will require us to pay a performance-based termination distribution to the Special Limited Partner if we terminate the advisory agreement prior to the listing of our shares for trading on an exchange or, absent a listing, in respect of its participation in net sales proceeds.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S6	To avoid paying this fee, our independent directors may decide against terminating the advisory agreement prior to our listing of our shares or disposition of our investments even if, but for the termination distribution, termination of the advisory agreement would be in our best interest.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S7	In addition, the requirement to pay the distribution the Special Limited Partner at termination could cause us to make different investment or disposition decisions than we would otherwise make, in order to satisfy our obligation to pay the distribution to the terminated advisor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S8	Moreover, our Advisor will have the right to terminate the advisory agreement upon a change of control of our company and thereby trigger the payment of the terminated distribution, which could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing the change of control.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S9	There is no separate counsel for us and our affiliates, which could result in conflicts of interest, and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect the value of your investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S10	Proskauer Rose LLP acts as legal counsel to us and also represents our Advisor and some of its affiliates.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S11	There is a possibility in the future that the interests of the various parties may become adverse and, under the Code of Professional Responsibility of the legal profession, Proskauer Rose LLP may be precluded from representing any one or all such parties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S12	If any situation arises in which our interests appear to be in conflict with those of our Advisor or its affiliates, additional counsel may be retained by one or more of the parties to assure that their interests are adequately protected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S13	Moreover, should a conflict of interest not be readily apparent, Proskauer Rose LLP may inadvertently act in derogation of the interest of the parties which could affect our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S14	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers, directors and our Advisor are limited, which could reduce your and our recovery against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S15	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation's best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S16	In addition, subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors, our officers and our Advisor and our Advisor's affiliates and permits us to indemnify our employees and agents.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S17	We and our stockholders also may have more limited rights against our directors, officers, employees and agents, and our Advisor and its affiliates, than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce your and our recovery against them.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S18	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents, or our Advisor and its affiliates in some cases.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S19	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P42_S20	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Similarly, this restriction further limits a stockholder's ability to sell shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may limit your ability to exit the investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has exempted any business combination involving our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P50_S3	As a result, our Advisor and any of its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P50_S4	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholder.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	"Control shares" are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Stockholders are limited in their ability to sell your shares pursuant to our share repurchase program and may have to hold shares for an indefinite period of time.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Our board of directors may amend the terms of our share repurchase program without stockholder approval.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Our board of directors also is free to amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate or reduce or increase the number of shares purchased under the share repurchase program upon 30 days' notice or to reject any request for repurchase.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S3	In addition, the share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that limit a stockholder s ability to sell shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Generally, the stockholder must have held the shares for at least one year in order to participate in our share repurchase program.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S5	Subject to funds being available, until we establish estimated values for our shares, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be based on the amount paid to us for the purchase of common stock (which will equal a percentage ranging from 90% to 97.5% until a stockholder has continuously held his shares for at least four years, at which point such percentage will be 100%).
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S6	The limits on repurchases under our share repurchase plan might prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any year.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S7	These restrictions severely limit a stockholder s ability to sell shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S8	Further, the price at which we repurchase share could be greater than the original purchase price for the shares less commissions and organization and offering costs associated with the shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S9	Thus, the repurchase could have the effect of diluting remaining stockholders shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S10	Existing stockholders interests will be diluted if we issue additional shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S11	Existing stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S12	Our charter currently authorizes us to issue 350 million shares of stock, of which 300 million shares are classified as common stock and 50 million are classified as preferred stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S13	Our board of directors may amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock, or the number of authorized shares of any class or series of stock, or may classify or reclassify any unissued shares into the classes or series of stock without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S14	Except for preferred stock, all our shares may be issued in the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S15	Existing stockholders likely will suffer dilution of their equity investment in us, if we: (a) sell additional shares in the future, including those issued pursuant to our DRIP; (b) sell securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock; (c) issue shares of our common stock in a private offering of securities to institutional investors; (d) issue restricted share awards to our directors; (e) issue shares to our Advisor or its affiliates, successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation as set forth under our advisory agreement or other agreements; or (f) issue shares of our common stock to sellers of properties acquired by us in connection with an exchange of limited partnership units of the OP ("OP Units").
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S16	In addition, the partnership agreement for our operating partnership contains provisions that would allow, under certain circumstances, other entities, including other American Realty Capital-sponsored programs, to merge into or cause the exchange or conversion of their interest for OP Units.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S17	Because the OP Units may, in the discretion of our board of directors, be exchanged for shares of our common stock, any merger, exchange or conversion between our operating partnership and another entity ultimately could result in the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, thereby diluting the percentage ownership interest of other stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S18	If we issue preferred stock, the holders thereof will, upon liquidation, be entitled to receive our available assets prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S19	Additionally, any preferred stock including convertible preferred stock or other securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for common stock that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P53_S20	Any preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay distributions to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of our common stock and diluting the interest of existing stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We depend on our operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries for cash flow and we will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of our operating subsidiary and its subsidiaries.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Our only significant asset is and will be the general partnership interests we own in our operating partnership.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S4	We conduct, and intend to conduct, all of our business operations through our operating partnership.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our operating partnership and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S6	There is no assurance that our operating partnership or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us that will enable us to make distributions to our stockholders from cash flows from operations or otherwise pay any other obligations.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Each of our operating partnership's subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from these entities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S8	In addition, because we are a holding company, stockholder claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P54_S9	Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy stockholder claims as stockholders only after all of our and our operating partnerships and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Office Industry Risks Declines in overall activity in our markets may adversely affect the performance of our office properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Our office properties may be adversely affected by market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Because our portfolio includes commercial office buildings located in the New York MSA, if economic conditions there persist or deteriorate, then our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service current debt and to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected by the following potential conditions, among others:
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	that reduced liquidity in debt markets and increased credit risk premiums for certain market participants may impair our ability to access capital.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	These conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay distributions, may continue or worsen in the future.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S2	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S4	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S5	The loss of anchor tenants for our office properties could adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S6	Our portfolio includes office properties and, as with our retail properties, we are subject to the risk that tenants may be unable to make their lease payments or may decline to extend a lease upon its expiration.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S7	A lease termination by a tenant that occupies a large area of space in one of our office properties (commonly referred to as an anchor tenant) could impact leases of other tenants.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S8	Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of a lease termination by an anchor tenant or the closure of the business of an anchor tenant that leaves its space vacant, even if the anchor tenant continues to pay rent.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S9	Any such modifications or conditions could be unfavorable to us as the property owner and could decrease rents or expense recoveries.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P57_S10	In the event of default by an anchor tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may be adversely affected by certain trends that reduce demand for office real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Some businesses are rapidly evolving to increasingly permit employee telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	These practices enable businesses to reduce their space requirements.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P58_S3	A continuation of the movement towards these practices could over time erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make expected distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Retail Industry Risks Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P59_S1	A retail property's revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our common stock may be negatively impacted.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Some of our leases provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P59_S4	A number of our retail leases also include a percentage rent clause for additional rent above the base amount based upon a specified percentage of the sales our tenants generate.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Under those leases which contain percentage rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we may derive from percentage rent leases could decline upon a general economic downturn.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our financial condition.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant's lease is terminated.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S1	These "co-tenancy" provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S8	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S9	Our retail tenants face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs, internet websites and telemarketing.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S10	Other retail centers within the market area of our properties may compete with our properties for customers, affecting their tenants' cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S11	In addition, some of our tenants' rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P64_S12	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The hotel industry is very competitive and seasonal and has been affected by economic slowdowns, terrorist attacks and other world events.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The hotel industry is intensely competitive and seasonal in nature and has been affected by the recent economic slowdown, terrorist attacks, military activity in the Middle East, natural disasters and other world events impacting the global economy and the travel and hotel industries, and, as a result, our lodging properties may be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Because the hotel industry is intensely competitive, our third-party management company and our third-party tenants may be unable to compete successfully or if our competitors' marketing strategies are more effective, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders, may be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	In particular, as a result of terrorist attacks around the world, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the effects of the economic recession, subsequent to 2001 the lodging industry experienced a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in both business and leisure travel.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S3	Our business and lodging properties may continue to be affected by such events, including our hotel occupancy levels and average daily rates, and, as a result, our revenues may decrease or not increase to levels we expect.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S4	Because we do not directly operate our lodging properties, our revenues depend on the ability of our third-party management company and our-third party tenants to compete successfully with other hotels in the New York MSA.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S5	Some of our competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S6	If our third-party management company and our third-party tenants are unable to compete successfully, including competition from Internet intermediaries, or if our competitors' marketing strategies are effective, our results of operations, financial condition, ability to service debt and ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P66_S7	In addition, the seasonality of the hotel industry can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and also may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, such as extreme or unexpectedly mild weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues, we may attempt to borrow in order to make distributions to our stockholders or be required to reduce other expenditures or distributions to stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Our profitability may be adversely affected by unstable market and business conditions and insufficient demand for lodging due to reduced business and leisure travel.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Our hotels will be subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P68_S2	These risks could adversely affect hotel occupancy and the rates that can be charged for hotel rooms as well as hotel operating expenses, and generally include:
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate, as discussed below.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We do not have control over the market and business conditions that affect the value of our lodging properties, and adverse changes with respect to such conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Hotel properties are subject to varying degrees of risk generally common to the ownership of hotels, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Adverse changes in any or all these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, thereby adversely impacting our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	As a REIT, we cannot directly operate our lodging properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, which could impact our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	We cannot and do not directly operate our lodging properties and, as a result, our results of operations, financial position, ability to service debt and our ability to make distributions to stockholders are dependent on the ability of our third-party management companies and our tenants to operate our hotel properties successfully.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly operate any lodging properties or actively participate in the decisions affecting their daily operations.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S3	Instead, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, we must enter into management agreements with a third-party management company, or we must lease our lodging properties to third-party tenants on a triple-net lease basis.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S4	We cannot and do not control this third-party management company or the tenants who operate and are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of our lodging properties, including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Thus, even if we believe our lodging properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party management company or the tenants to change their method of operation of our lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S6	Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and our ability to service debt and to make distributions to stockholders are, therefore, dependent on the ability of our third-party management company and tenants to operate our lodging properties successfully.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S7	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator and/or its affiliated brands generally may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and consequently cash flows thereby impacting our ability to service debt, and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P71_S8	There can be no assurance that our affiliate will continue to manage any lodging properties we acquire.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We will rely on a third-party hotel management company to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S1	We do not, however, control the design or implementation of or changes to internal controls at any of our lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Thus, even if we believe that our lodging properties are being operated without effective internal controls, we may not be able to require the third-party management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S3	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S5	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party management company will implement at our lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S6	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at one or more of our lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S7	If we replace a third-party management company or tenant, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement or lease to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at the affected lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S8	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party management company or tenants with substantial prior lodging experience in the future.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S9	If we experience such disruptions, it may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S10	Our use of the taxable REIT subsidiary structure will increase our expenses.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S11	A taxable REIT subsidiary structure will subject us to the risk of increased lodging operating expenses.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S12	The performance of our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be based on the operations of our lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S13	Our operating risks will include not only changes in hotel revenues and changes to our taxable REIT subsidiaries ability to pay the rent due to us under the leases, but also increased hotel operating expenses, including, but not limited to, the following cost elements: wage and benefit costs; repair and maintenance expenses; energy costs; property taxes; insurance costs; and other operating expenses.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S14	Any increases in one or more these operating expenses could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P72_S15	Failure to maintain franchise licenses could decrease our revenues.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The inability to maintain franchise licenses could decrease our revenues.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Maintenance of franchise licenses for our lodging properties is subject to maintaining our franchisor s operating standards and other terms and conditions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Franchisors periodically inspect lodging properties to ensure that such lodging properties are maintained in accordance with their standards.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Failure to maintain our lodging properties in accordance with these standards or comply with other terms and conditions of the applicable franchise agreement could result in a franchise license being canceled.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S4	If a franchise license terminates due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms, we may also be liable to the franchisor for a termination fee.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S5	As a condition to the maintenance of a franchise license, our franchisor could also require us to make capital expenditures, even if we do not believe the capital improvements are necessary, desirable, or likely to result in an acceptable return on our investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S6	We may risk losing a franchise license if we do not make franchisor-required capital expenditures.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S7	If our franchisor terminates the franchise license, we may try either to obtain a suitable replacement franchise or to operate the lodging property without a franchise license.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S8	The loss of a franchise license could materially and adversely affect the operations or the underlying value of the lodging property because of the loss associated with the brand recognition and/or the marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P73_S9	A loss of a franchise license for one or more lodging properties could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	There are risks associated with employing hotel employees.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P74_S1	We will generally be subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel employees.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Any lodging properties we acquire will be leased to one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries and be subject to management agreements with our property manager or a third-party property manager to operate the properties that we do not lease to a third party under a net lease.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Hotel operating revenues and expenses for these properties will be included in our consolidated results of operations.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P74_S4	As a result, although we do not directly employ or manage the labor force at our lodging properties, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	appropriate processes and controls over such activities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	From time to time, the operations of our lodging properties may be disrupted through strikes, public demonstrations or other labor actions and related publicity.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of the aforementioned disruptions, or contract disputes or other events.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S2	A third-party property manager may be targeted by union actions or adversely impacted by the disruption caused by organizing activities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S3	Significant adverse disruptions caused by union activities or increased costs affiliated with such activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S4	The expanding use of Internet travel websites by customers can adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S5	The increasing use of Internet travel intermediaries by consumers may experience fluctuations in operating performance during the year and otherwise adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S6	Our property manager and any third-party property manager will rely upon Internet travel intermediaries such as Travelocity.com, Expedia.com, Orbitz.com, Hotels.com and Priceline.com to generate demand for our lodging properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S7	As Internet bookings increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from our property manager or any third-party property manager.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S8	Moreover, some of these Internet travel intermediaries are attempting to offer hotel rooms as a commodity, by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as three-star downtown hotel ) at the expense of brand identification.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S9	Consumers may eventually develop brand loyalties to their reservations system rather than to our property manager or any third-party property manager and/or our brands, which could have an adverse effect on our business because we will rely heavily on brand identification.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S10	If the amount of sales made through Internet intermediaries increases significantly and our property manager or a third-party property manager fails to appropriately price room inventory in a manner that maximizes the opportunity for enhanced profit margins, room revenues may flatten or decrease and our profitability may be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S11	Residential Industry Risks The short-term nature of our residential leases may adversely impact our income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S12	If our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet their units.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S13	Because substantially all our residential leases will be for apartments, they generally will be for terms of no more than one or two years.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P76_S14	If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances result in a reduction in rental income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	An economic downturn could adversely affect the residential industry and may affect operations for the residential properties that we acquire.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	As a result of the effects of an economic downturn, including increased unemployment rates, the residential industry may experience a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in overall renters.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The current economic downturn and increase in unemployment rates may have an adverse effect on our operations if the tenants occupying the residential properties we acquire cease making rent payments to us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Moreover, low residential mortgage interest rates could accompany an economic downturn and encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Our residential properties may experience declines in occupancy rate due to any such decline in residential mortgage interest rates.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Industrial Industry Risks Potential liability as the result of, and the cost of compliance with, environmental matters is greater if we invest in industrial properties or lease our properties to tenants that engage in industrial activities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on such property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	We may invest in properties historically used for industrial, manufacturing and commercial purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Some of these properties are more likely to contain, or may have contained, underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P81_S2	All of these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Leasing properties to tenants that engage in industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities will cause us to be subject to increased risk of liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The demand for and profitability of our industrial properties may be adversely affected by fluctuations in manufacturing activity in the United States.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Our industrial properties may be adversely affected if manufacturing activity decreases in the United States.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Trade agreements with foreign countries have given employers the option to utilize less expensive non-US manufacturing workers.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P85_S1	The outsourcing of manufacturing functions could lower the demand for our industrial properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Moreover, an increase in the cost of raw materials or decrease in the demand of housing could cause a slowdown in manufacturing activity, such as furniture, textiles, machinery and chemical products, and our profitability may be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P85_S3	Our portfolio may be negatively impacted by a high concentration of industrial tenants in a single industry.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P85_S4	If we invest in industrial properties, we may lease properties to tenants that engage in similar industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P85_S5	A high concentration of tenants in a specific industry would magnify the adverse impact that a downturn in such industry might otherwise have to our portfolio.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P85_S6	We have broad authority to incur debt, and high levels of debt could hinder our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of your investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We expect that in most instances, we will acquire real properties by using either existing financing or borrowing new funds.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	In addition, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge all or some of our real properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional real properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We may borrow if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P87_S1	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Our Advisor believes that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objective of maximizing the return to investors.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow against any single improved property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S1	Under our charter, our borrowings may not exceed 300% of our total "net assets" (as defined in our charter and in accordance with the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for exceeding such limit.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S2	This charter limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S3	In addition, it is our intention to limit our borrowings to 40% to 50% of the aggregate fair market value of our assets (calculated after the close of our offering and once we have invested substantially all the proceeds of our offering), unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report following such borrowing along with justification for such excess borrowing.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S4	This limitation, however, will not apply to individual real estate assets or investments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S5	At the date of acquisition of each asset, we anticipate that that the cost of investment for such asset will be substantially similar to its fair market value, which will enable us to satisfy our requirements under the NASAA REIT Guidelines.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S6	However, subsequent events, including changes in the fair market value of our assets, could result in our exceeding these limits.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S7	If we obtain independent director approval and borrow in excess of these limitation, our debt levels will be higher until we have invested most of our capital.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S8	High debt levels would cause us to incur higher interest charges, would result in higher debt service payments and could be accompanied by restrictive covenants.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P88_S9	These factors could limit the amount of cash we have available to distribute and could result in a decline in the value of your investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	If there is a shortfall between the cash flow from a property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt on a property, then the amount available for distributions to stockholders may be reduced.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P89_S1	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P89_S2	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of your investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P89_S3	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P89_S4	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P89_S5	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of distributions required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P90_S1	When we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P91_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P91_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to pay cash distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the value of your investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Lenders may require us to enter into restrictive covenants relating to our operations, which could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In connection with providing us financing, a lender could impose restrictions on us that affect our distribution and operating policies and our ability to incur additional debt.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Loan documents we enter into may contain covenants that limit our ability to further mortgage the property, discontinue insurance coverage or replace our Advisor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S3	These or other limitations may adversely affect our flexibility and our ability to achieve our investment and operating objectives.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S5	To the extent that we incur variable rate debt, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay distributions to you.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S6	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S7	U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S8	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S9	However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in our best interests, or inadvertently.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S10	Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S11	The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S12	Furthermore, any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service "IRS") and is not a guarantee that we will qualify, or continue to qualify, as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S13	Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S14	Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S15	Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S16	Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S17	Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S18	If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S19	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S20	Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S21	In addition, distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S22	If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S23	Even if we qualify as a REIT, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S24	Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P92_S25	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are "dealer" properties sold by a REIT (a "prohibited transaction" under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P93_S0	We may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P93_S1	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P93_S2	In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P93_S3	However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P94_S0	We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P94_S1	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P94_S2	Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P95_S0	To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P95_S1	This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P96_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P96_S1	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4%nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P96_S2	These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P96_S3	It is possible that we might not always be able to make distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P97_S1	For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P97_S2	Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P98_S1	We intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS would incur corporate rate income taxes with respect to any income or gain recognized by it), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction, or (c) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with the requirements of the prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for properties that, among other requirements, have been held for at least two years.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Despite our present intention, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding TRSs will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P99_S0	A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P99_S2	A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P99_S3	Overall, no more than 25% of the gross value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P100_S0	A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P100_S1	We may operate our "qualified assets" through one or more TRSs that lease such properties from us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P100_S2	We may use our TRSs generally for other activities as well, such as to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P101_S0	A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P101_S1	In addition, the rules, which are applicable to us as a REIT, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P101_S2	If our leases to our TRSs are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P101_S3	Rents paid to our operating partnership by our TRSs pursuant to the lease of our "qualified assets" will constitute substantially all of our gross income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P101_S4	In order for such rent to qualify as "rents from real property" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P101_S5	If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S0	If our operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S1	We intend to maintain the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S2	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S3	In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that our operating partnership could make to us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S4	This also would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S5	This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay distributions and the yield on your investment.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S6	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which our operating partnership owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the operating partnership.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S7	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S8	Our investments in certain debt instruments may cause us to recognize "phantom income" for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though no cash payments have been received on the debt instruments, and certain modifications of such debt by us could cause the modified debt to not qualify as a good REIT asset, thereby jeopardizing our REIT qualification.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S9	Our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S10	In addition, if a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S11	As a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S12	In such circumstances, we may be required to (a) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (b) borrow on unfavorable terms, (c) distribute amounts that would otherwise be used for future acquisitions or used to repay debt, or (d) make a taxable distribution of our shares of common stock as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares of common stock or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution) cash, in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S13	Moreover, we may acquire distressed debt investments that require subsequent modification by agreement with the borrower.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S14	If the amendments to the outstanding debt are "significant modifications" under the applicable Treasury Regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt taxable exchange with the borrower.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S15	This deemed reissuance may prevent the modified debt from qualifying as a good REIT asset if the underlying security has declined in value and would cause us to recognize income to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S16	The failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S17	In general, in order for a loan to be treated as a qualifying real estate asset producing qualifying income for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, the loan must be secured by real property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S18	We may acquire mezzanine loans that are not directly secured by real property but instead secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S19	In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan that is not secured by real estate would, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S20	Although the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law and in many cases it may not be possible for us to meet all the requirements of the safe harbor.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S21	We cannot provide assurance that any mezzanine loan in which we invest would be treated as a qualifying asset producing qualifying income for REIT qualification purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P102_S22	If any such loan fails either the REIT income or asset tests, we may be disqualified as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We may choose to make distributions in our own stock, in which case the stockholder may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of the cash dividends received by them.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S1	In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S2	In order to satisfy this requirement, we may make distributions that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such distributions) at the election of each stockholder.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S3	Taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S4	As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S5	Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S6	If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S7	Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such distribution and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S8	Various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock distribution are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P103_S9	No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock distributions, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock distributions have not been met.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S0	The taxation of distributions to our stockholders can be complex; however, distributions that we make to our stockholders generally will be taxable as ordinary income, which may reduce your anticipated return from an investment in us.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Distributions that we make to our taxable stockholders out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S2	However, a portion of our distributions may (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (2) be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from our TRSs, or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S3	A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Our stockholders may have tax liability on distributions that they elect to reinvest in common stock, but they would not receive the cash from such distributions to pay such tax liability.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S5	If our stockholders participate in our DRIP, they will be deemed to have received, and for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed on, the amount reinvested in shares of our common stock to the extent the amount reinvested was not a tax-free return of capital.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S6	In addition, our stockholders will be treated for tax purposes as having received an additional distribution to the extent the shares are purchased at a discount to fair market value.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P104_S7	As a result, unless a stockholder is a tax-exempt entity, it may have to use funds from other sources to pay its tax liability on the value of the shares of common stock received.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Currently, the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Although this does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Tax rates could be changed in future legislation.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P107_S0	If we were considered to actually or constructively pay a "preferential dividend" to certain of our stockholders, our status as a REIT could be adversely affected.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P107_S1	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P107_S2	A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Currently, there is uncertainty as to the IRS's position regarding whether certain arrangements that REITs have with their stockholders could give rise to the inadvertent payment of a preferential dividend (e.g., the pricing methodology for stock purchased under a distribution reinvestment plan inadvertently causing a greater than 5% discount on the price of such stock purchased).
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P109_S0	While we believe that our operations have been structured in such a manner that we will not be treated as inadvertently paying preferential dividends, there is no de minimis exception with respect to preferential dividends.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P109_S1	Therefore, if the IRS were to take the position that we inadvertently paid a preferential dividend, we may be deemed either to (a) have distributed less than 100% of our REIT taxable income and be subject to tax on the undistributed portion, or (b) have distributed less than 90% of our REIT taxable income and our status as a REIT could be terminated for the year in which such determination is made if we were unable to cure such failure.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P110_S1	The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P110_S2	Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P110_S3	To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P110_S4	As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P110_S5	This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P110_S6	In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forego and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S1	The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S2	In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) and no more than 25% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S4	As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S5	These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S6	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S7	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S8	While we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in our best interests.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P112_S9	If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P113_S0	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the market price of our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P114_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P114_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P114_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P114_S3	You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P114_S4	You also should note that our counsel's tax opinion is based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P115_S0	Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P115_S1	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P115_S2	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P115_S3	The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our shares of stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S1	Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares of stock under this requirement.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S2	Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S3	To help insure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of our shares of stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S4	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT while we so qualify.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S5	Unless exempted by our board of directors, for so long as we qualify as a REIT, our charter prohibits, among other limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock, any person from beneficially or constructively owning (applying certain attribution rules under the Code) more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S6	Our board of directors may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would result in the termination of our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S7	These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S8	These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S9	Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S10	If we enter into sale-leaseback transactions, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to structure any such sale- leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a "true lease" for tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S11	The IRS may, however, challenge the characterization.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S12	In the event that any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to the property would be disallowed.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S13	If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification "asset tests" or "income tests" and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P116_S14	Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P117_S0	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on distributions received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P117_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, distributions received from us will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P117_S2	Such dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as "effectively connected" with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S0	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ("FIRPTA") capital gain distributions attributable to sales or exchanges of "U.S. real property interests" ("USRPIs") generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S1	However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the distribution is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 5% of the class of our stock at any time during the one- year period ending on the date the distribution is received.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S2	We do not anticipate that our shares will be "regularly traded" on an established securities market for the foreseeable future, and therefore, this exception is not expected to apply.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S3	Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S4	Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a "domestically-controlled qualified investment entity".
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S5	A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT's stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S6	We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically- controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P118_S7	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if (a) our common stock is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale.
1474464_14_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Potential characterization of distributions or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax- exempt investors.
1474464_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we owned 23 properties and real estate-related assets located in the New York MSA.

1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	Holders As of February 14, 2014 , we had 175.1 million shares of common stock outstanding held by a total of 38,168 stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	We have elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S4	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors approved, and we declared, a distribution rate equal to a 6.05% annualized rate based on the common share price of $10.00, or $0.605 per share per annum, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S5	The dividend is calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S6	From a tax perspective, of the amounts distributed during the year ended December 31, 2013 , 93.1%, or $0.563 per share per annum and 6.9%, or $0.042 per share per annum, represented a return of capital and ordinary dividends, respectively.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2012, 83.8%, or $0.51 per share per annum, and 16.2%, or $0.095 per share per annum, represented a return of capital and ordinary dividends, respectively.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P0_S8	Our distributions are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	The first distribution was paid in January 2011.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	The following table reflects distributions paid in cash and through the DRIP to common stockholders, excluding distributions related to unvested restricted shares and Class B units, during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	We, our board of directors and Advisor share a similar philosophy with respect to paying our distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S1	The distributions should principally be derived from cash flows generated from real estate operations.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S2	In order to improve our operating cash flows and our ability to pay distributions from operating cash flows, our related party Advisor and Property Manager agreed to waive certain fees including asset management and property management fees.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S3	Prior to July 1, 2012 we paid the Advisor a monthly asset management fee equal to one-twelfth of 0.75% of the aggregate contract purchase price of all real estate investments.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S4	Effective July 1, 2012, we issue to the Advisor restricted performance based Class B units for asset management fees, which will be forfeited immediately if certain conditions occur.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the board of directors approved the issuance of 454,739 Class B units to the Advisor in connection with this arrangement.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S6	We also pay our Property Manager a property management fee of up to 4% per annum of the gross revenues of properties managed.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S7	Prior to July 1, 2012, the Advisor elected to waive the asset management fees.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S8	The Property Manager elected to waive the property management fees for both the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S9	In aggregate, $0.8 million and $1.0 million of fees were waived during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S10	The Advisor and Property Manager will determine if a portion of property management fees will be waived in subsequent periods on a quarter-to-quarter basis.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S11	The fees that were waived are not deferrals and accordingly, will not be paid by us.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S12	Because the Advisor waived certain fees that we owed, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor and the Property Manager was available to pay distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S13	In certain instances, to improve our working capital, the Advisor may elect to absorb a portion of our costs that would otherwise have been paid by us.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S14	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Advisor absorbed $1.5 million and $1.0 million , respectively.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S15	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , cash used to pay our distributions was generated mainly from funds received from cash flows provided by operations, proceeds from common stock and proceeds from common stock issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S16	As additional capital is raised and we continue to build our portfolio of investments, we expect that we will use funds received from operating activities to pay a greater proportion of our distributions and will be able to reduce and in the future eliminate the use of funds from the sale of common stock to pay distributions .
1474464_14_ITEM5_P2_S17	As the cash flows from operations become more significant our Property Manager may discontinue its past practice of forgiving fees and providing contributions and may charge the full fee owed to it in accordance with our agreements.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	Share-Based Compensation Plans We have a stock option plan (the "Plan") which authorizes the grant of nonqualified stock options to our independent directors, subject to the absolute discretion of the board of directors and the applicable limitations of the Plan.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P4_S1	The exercise price for all stock options granted under the Plan to the independent directors will be determined in accordance with applicable rules and regulations including, if our shares are listed the applicable rules and regulations of the national securities exchange on which the shares are listed.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P4_S2	Notwithstanding any other provisions of our Plan to the contrary, no stock option issued pursuant thereto may be exercised if such exercise would jeopardize our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our stock option plan as of December 31, 2013 :
1474464_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	Restricted Share Plan We have an employee and director incentive restricted share plan (the "RSP") that provides for the automatic grant of 3,000 restricted shares of common stock to each of the independent directors, without any further action by our board of directors or the stockholders, on the date of initial election to the board of directors and on the date of each annual stockholder's meeting.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P6_S1	Restricted stock issued to independent directors will vest over a five-year period following the first anniversary of the date of grant in increments of 20% per annum.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	The RSP provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain consultants to us and the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P7_S1	The total number of shares of common stock granted under the RSP shall not exceed 5.0% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis at any time, and in any event will not exceed 7.5 million shares (as such number may be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and similar events).
1474464_14_ITEM5_P8_S0	Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of common stock from us under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P8_S1	Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient's employment or other relationship with us.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S0	Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S1	Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S2	Any distributions payable in common shares shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , we had 24,000 unvested restricted shares outstanding that were granted pursuant to the RSP.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S4	Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities We did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S5	Use of Proceeds from Sales of Registered Securities On September 2, 2010, we commenced our IPO on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to the Registration Statement filed with the SEC under the Securities Act.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S6	The Registration Statement also covered up to 25.0 million shares available pursuant to a DRIP under which our common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at the greater of $9.50 per share and 95% of the estimated value of a share of common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S7	On August 2, 2013, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to register follow-on offering up to 12.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share on a best efforts basis and 1.25 million shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP at $9.50 per share.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S8	As of December 31, 2013 , we had 174.1 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted shares of convertible preferred stock and shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S9	As of December 31, 2013 , we had received common stock proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale of 172.1 million shares of common stock, including DRIP and net of repurchases.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S10	On November 27, 2013, we registered an additional 25.0 million shares to be used under the DRIP (including a direct stock component) pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3D (File No. 333-192576).
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S11	The new DRIP, including the direct stock component, became effective December 6, 2013 and, as permitted by the IPO prospectus, we reallocated the remaining DRIP shares from our IPO to the IPO s primary offering.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P9_S12	As of December 11, 2013, we closed the IPO following the successful achievement of our target equity raise and therefore did not launch our follow-on offering.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P10_S0	The following table reflects the offering costs associated with the issuance of common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P11_S0	__________________ (1) The Advisor elected to reimburse our offering costs in excess of 1.5% of proceeds from the sale of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1474464_14_ITEM5_P12_S0	The Dealer Manager reallowed the selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P12_S1	The following table details the selling commissions incurred and reallowed related to the sale of shares of common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P13_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , we have incurred $174.9 million of cumulative offering costs in connection with the issuance and distribution of common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P13_S1	Offering proceeds of $1.7 billion exceeded cumulative offering costs by $1.5 billion at December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM5_P13_S2	Cumulative offering costs include $152.0 million incurred from our Dealer Manager for dealer manager fees and commissions and $14.3 million from our Advisor, net of the Advisor's reimbursement related to the 15% cap on total offering costs by the Advisor during the IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P13_S3	We expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our IPO to primarily acquire income-producing commercial real estate in the New York MSA, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P13_S4	We may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P13_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , we have used the net proceeds from our IPO, secured debt financing and credit facility to purchase 23 real estate-related investments with an aggregate gross purchase price of $2.1 billion .
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S0	Our common stock is currently not listed on a national securities exchange and we will not seek to list our stock until such time as our independent directors believe that the listing of our stock would be in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S1	Our board has determined that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to proceed to file an application to list our shares of common stock on a national securities exchange.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S2	In order to provide stockholders with the benefit of some interim liquidity, our board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program (the "SRP") that enables our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to significant conditions and limitations.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S3	Our Sponsor, Advisor, directors and affiliates are prohibited from receiving a fee on any share repurchases.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S4	Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at our sole discretion and generally will be made quarterly.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S5	We will limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 st of the previous calendar year (on a ratable basis during each quarterly period during the year).
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S6	In addition, we are only authorized to repurchase shares pursuant to the SRP up to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP and will limit the amount spent to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP in that same quarter.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S7	Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S8	Unless the shares of our common stock are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder's death, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our SRP will be as set forth below until we establish an estimated value of our shares.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S9	Unless our shares are listed on a national exchange, we expect to begin establishing an estimated value of our shares based on the value of our real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of our IPO, or June 11, 2015.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P14_S10	We will retain persons independent of us and our Advisor to prepare the estimated value of our shares.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P15_S0	Only those stockholders who purchased their shares from us or received their shares from us (directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions may be able to participate in the SRP.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P15_S1	In other words, once our shares are transferred for value by a stockholder, the transferee and all subsequent holders of the shares are not eligible to participate in the SRP.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P16_S0	We will repurchase shares as of the last business day of each quarter (and in all events on a date other than a dividend payment date).
1474464_14_ITEM5_P16_S1	Prior to establishing the estimated value of our shares, the price per share that we will pay to repurchase shares of our common stock will be as follows:
1474464_14_ITEM5_P17_S0	the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the price paid to acquire the shares from us for stockholders who have continuously held their shares for at least four years (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_14_ITEM5_P17_S1	Upon the death or disability of a stockholder, upon request, we will waive the one-year holding requirement.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P17_S2	Shares repurchased in connection with the death or disability of a stockholder will be repurchased at a purchase price equal to the price actually paid for the shares during the offering, or if not engaged in the offering, the per share purchase price will be based on the greater of $10.00 or the then-current net asset value of the shares as determined by our board of directors (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock).
1474464_14_ITEM5_P17_S3	In addition, we may waive the holding period in the event of a stockholder's bankruptcy or other exigent circumstances.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P17_S4	The following table summarizes our SRP activity for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
1474464_14_ITEM5_P17_S5	The value of repurchases did not exceed DRIP elections by stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P18_S0	We fund share repurchases from proceeds from the sale of common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P19_S0	_________________________ (1) Includes six unfulfilled repurchase requests consisting of 51,829 shares at an average price per share of $9.76 , which were approved for repurchase as of December 31, 2013 and completed in February 2014.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P20_S0	We process repurchases on a quarterly basis.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P20_S1	The following table summarizes repurchase requests pursuant to our SRP for each quarter during the year ended December 31, 2013 :
1474464_14_ITEM5_P21_S0	__________________________ (1) Includes six unfulfilled repurchase requests consisting of 51,829 shares at an average price per share of $9.76 , which were approved for repurchase as of December 31, 2013 and completed in February 2014.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P22_S0	The share repurchase program will terminate immediately if our shares are listed on any national securities exchange.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P22_S1	In addition, our board of directors may amend, suspend (in whole or in part) or terminate the share repurchase program at any time upon 30 days' prior written notice to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM5_P22_S2	Further, our board of directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any requests for repurchases.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	Organization We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT") beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	On September 2, 2010, we commenced our initial public offering (the "IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-11, as amended (File No. 333-163069) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our Registration Statement also covered up to 25.0 million shares available pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") under which our common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of our common stock at the greater of $9.50 per share or 95% of the estimated value of a share of common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	On August 2, 2013, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to register a follow-on offering of up to 12.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share on a reasonable best efforts basis and 1.25 million shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP at $9.50 per share.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	On November 27, 2013, we registered an additional 25.0 million shares to be used under the DRIP (including a direct stock component) pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3D (File No. 333-192576).
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	The new DRIP, including the direct stock component, became effective December 6, 2013 and, as permitted by the IPO prospectus, we reallocated the remaining DRIP shares from our IPO to the IPO s primary offering.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S5	As of December 11, 2013, we closed the IPO following the successful achievement of our target equity raise and therefore we did not launch our follow-on offering.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S6	As of December 31, 2013 , we had 174.1 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted shares of convertible preferred stock (the "Preferred Shares") and shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S7	As of December 31, 2013 , we had received total gross proceeds from the IPO and the DRIP of $1.7 billion from the sale of 172.1 million shares of common stock, including shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S8	In addition, we sold 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act, which terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the Registration Statement.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P1_S9	On December 15, 2011, we exercised our option to convert the Preferred Shares into 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the aggregate value of all issuances and subscriptions of common stock outstanding was $1.7 billion based on a per share value of $10.00 (or $9.50 for shares issued under the DRIP).
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	We were formed to acquire income-producing commercial and residential real estate in the New York metropolitan statistical area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	We also may originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	We purchased our first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , we owned 23 properties and real estate-related assets.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "OP"), a Delaware limited partnership.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S6	We have retained New York Recovery Advisors, LLC (our "Advisor") to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S7	New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") serves as our property manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S8	Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of our IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S9	The Advisor and the Property Manager are wholly owned entities of, and the Dealer Manager is under common ownership with, American Realty Capital III, LLC (the "Sponsor"), as a result of which, they are related parties and receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of our assets.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P3_S10	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include: Offering and Related Costs Offering and related costs include all expenses incurred in connection with our IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	Offering costs (other than selling commissions and the dealer manager fees) include costs that may be paid by the Advisor, the Dealer Manager or their affiliates on our behalf.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	These costs include but are not limited to (i) legal, accounting, printing, mailing, and filing fees; (ii) escrow service related fees; (iii) reimbursement of the Dealer Manager for amounts it may pay to reimburse the bona fide diligence expenses of broker-dealers; and (iv) reimbursement to the Advisor for a portion of the costs of its employees and other costs in connection with preparing supplemental sales materials and related offering activities.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S6	We were obligated to reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, as applicable, for organization and offering costs paid by them on our behalf, provided that the Advisor was obligated to reimburse us to the extent organization and offering costs (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) incurred by us in our offering exceed 1.5% of gross offering proceeds in the IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S7	As a result, these costs were only our liability to the extent aggregate selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs did not exceed 11.5% of the gross proceeds determined at the end of our IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P4_S8	As of the end of our IPO in December 2013, offering costs were less than 11.5% of the gross proceeds in the IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	When we acquire a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P5_S5	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Investments in Real Estate Investments in real estate are recorded at cost.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to ten years for fixtures and building improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	We are required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as "held for sale" on the balance sheet.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Long-lived assets are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted or when they are designated as held for sale.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Valuation of real estate is considered a "critical accounting estimate" because the evaluation of impairment and the determination of fair values involve a number of management assumptions relating to future economic events that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value, and therefore, the carrying amounts, of our real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Additionally, decisions regarding when a property should be classified as held for sale are also highly subjective and require significant management judgment.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Events or changes in circumstances that could cause an evaluation for impairment include the following:
1474464_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	We review our portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate the existence of any of the aforementioned events or changes in circumstances that would require us to test for recoverability.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	In general, our review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value expected, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	We allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if-vacant basis.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	We utilize various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if-vacant property value.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S4	Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings and fixtures are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third parties or on our analysis of comparable properties in our portfolio.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S5	Identifiable intangible assets include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S6	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S7	Factors considered by us in our analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S8	In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P15_S9	We also estimate costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, we initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationships, as applicable, is measured based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Characteristics considered by us in determining these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from 1 to 29 years .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	If a tenant terminates its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles is charged to expense.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our borrowings.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	Derivatives also may be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.

1474464_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The guidance was effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 with retrospective application for all comparative periods presented.

1474464_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	The amendments allow an entity to initially assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	An entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	The amendments were effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.

1474464_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	These inflows were partially offset by payments related to offering costs of $148.2 million , repayments of mortgage notes payable of $72.9 million , distributions to stockholders of $17.8 million , payments related to financing costs of $7.6 million , increases to restricted cash of $0.2 million , payments to non-controlling interest holders of $1.0 million and payments of distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $0.1 million .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	Cash Flows for the Year ended Ended December 31, 2012 For the year ended December 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $3.0 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	Cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 included $6.1 million of acquisition and transaction costs.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	Cash flows provided by operating activities included a net loss adjusted for non-cash items, resulting in a cash inflow of $2.5 million (net loss of $6.3 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets and other non-cash charges of $8.8 million) as well as a combined increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent of $3.9 million mainly due to an increase in accrued acquisition and transaction related costs as well as interest expense payable and tenant deposits.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	This cash inflow was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $3.3 million primarily due to unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis and prepaid real estate taxes.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2012 of $145.8 million related to $229.1 million for the acquisition of seven properties, which were partially funded with proceeds from mortgage notes payable received at acquisition of $79.2 million and reduced by liabilities assumed at acquisition mainly related to building improvements and leasehold interests of $4.8 million as well as minority interest retained by a seller of $0.4 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	Cash used in investing activities also related to $1.0 million for capital expenditures at the Interior Design Building during the period.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Net cash provided by financing activities of $137.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 related to proceeds, net of receivables and repurchases, from the issuance of common stock of $127.5 million, proceeds net of repayments on our credit facility of $20.0 million and proceeds, net of repayments, from mortgage notes payable of $31.1 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	These inflows were partially offset by payments of $12.0 million to purchase our affiliate's non-controlling interest in our Bleecker Street subsidiary, payments related to offering costs of $13.6 million, payments on notes payable of $5.9 million, distributions to stockholders of $3.4 million, payments related to financing costs of $4.6 million, increases to restricted cash of $0.8 million and distributions to non-controlling members of $0.5 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 For the year ended December 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $0.3 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S5	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by acquisition and transaction costs incurred, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S6	Cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 include $1.6 million of acquisition and transaction costs.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S7	Results include a net loss adjusted for non-cash items, which resulted in a cash inflow of $1.3 million (net loss of $3.4 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets and other non-cash charges of $4.7 million) as well as a combined increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred rent of $0.2 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S8	This cash inflow was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.2 million primarily due to prepaid real estate taxes and insurance as well as unbilled rent receivables recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S9	Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 of $25.7 million primarily related to $25.3 million for the acquisition of real estate assets.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S10	The contract purchase price of $57.9 million for the properties was partially funded by mortgage notes payable of $32.7 million on the acquisition dates.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S11	Cash used in investing activities also included $0.5 million related to capital expenditures at the Interior Design Building.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S12	Net cash provided by financing activities of $35.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 related to proceeds, net of receivables, from the issuance of common stock of $42.5 million and mortgage notes payable from the refinancing of the Interior Design Building for $21.3 million as well as decreases in restricted cash of $0.6 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P44_S13	This inflow was partially offset by principal payments on mortgage notes payable of $14.1 million, primarily due to the refinancing of the Interior Design Building, payments related to offering costs of $10.1 million, distributions to stockholders of $2.0 million, payments related to financing costs of $2.0 million and distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $0.9 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal demands for funds will continue to be for property acquisitions, either directly or through investment interests, for the payment of operating expenses, distributions to our stockholders and non-controlling interest holders, and for the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Generally, capital needs for property acquisitions will be met through net proceeds received from the sale of common stock through our IPO as well as proceeds from our credit facility.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	We also may from time to time enter into other agreements with third parties whereby third parties will make equity investments in specific properties or groups of properties that we acquire.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	Expenditures other than property acquisitions and acquisition and transaction-related costs are expected to be covered by cash flows from operations.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	We expect to meet our future short-term operating liquidity requirements through a combination of net cash provided by our current property operations and the operations of properties to be acquired in the future, proceeds from our DRIP and proceeds from our credit facility.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	Management expects that in the future, as our portfolio matures, our properties will cover operating expenses and the payment of our monthly distribution.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from public and private offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	We expect to utilize the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and proceeds from our credit facility to complete future property acquisitions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , we had 174.1 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted Preferred Shares and shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , we had received gross proceeds of $1.7 billion and $17.0 million from the sale of shares of common stock and Preferred Shares, respectively.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S6	Our board of directors has adopted a share repurchase plan that enables our stockholders to sell their shares to us under limited circumstances.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S7	At the time a stockholder requests a repurchase, we may, subject to certain conditions, repurchase the shares presented for repurchase for cash to the extent we have sufficient funds available to fund such purchase.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P47_S8	The following table reflects the cumulative number of shares repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 :
1474464_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	__________________________ As of December 31, 2013 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $ 233.4 million .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	We expect cash flows from operations and the sale of common stock to be used primarily to invest in additional real estate, pay debt service, pay operating expenses and pay stockholder distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our Advisor evaluates potential acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets and engages in negotiations with sellers and borrowers on our behalf.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	Investors should be aware that after a purchase contract is executed that contains specific terms, the property will not be purchased until the successful completion of due diligence and fully negotiated binding agreements.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	During this period, we may decide to temporarily invest any unused proceeds from common stock offerings in certain investments that could yield lower returns than the properties.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P48_S5	These lower returns may affect our ability to make distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ("FFO"), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1474464_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the "White Paper").
1474464_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P51_S1	We believe that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P51_S2	Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P51_S3	An asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indicators exist and if the carrying, or book, value exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P51_S4	Investors should note, however, that determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P51_S5	While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	However, FFO and modified funds from operations ("MFFO"), as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P52_S4	The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	Management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	We used the proceeds raised in our IPO to, among other things, acquire properties, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event during the second quarter of 2014 through the listing of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	Thus, unless we raise, or recycle, a significant amount of capital in the future, we will not be continuing to purchase assets at the same rate as during our IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Investment Program Association ("IPA"), an industry trade group, has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we purchase a significant amount of new assets.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is stabilized.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance now that our IPO has been completed and our portfolio has been stabilized.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P55_S5	Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance after our IPO and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations ("Practice Guideline") issued by the IPA in November 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments); accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant to review all our hedging agreements.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	Inasmuch as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of ongoing operations.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	Our MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P58_S3	In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to non-controlling interests.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are acquired and will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	MFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to that of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activities and have similar operating characteristics as us.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S5	Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S6	In addition, we view fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P59_S7	We view both gains and losses from dispositions of assets and fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, has been a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Because our IPO is completed, in the absence of a new capital raise, acquisition fees and expenses will now be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	Our management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as a limited and defined acquisition period.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S3	Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S4	By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides useful supplemental information.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S5	Presentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S6	Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S7	Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P61_S8	FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	Neither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	The table below reflects the items deducted from or added to net loss in our calculation of FFO and MFFO during the periods presented.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	The table reflects MFFO in the IPA recommended format and MFFO without the straight-line rent adjustment which management also uses as a performance measure.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	Items are presented net of non-controlling interest portions where applicable.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	______________________________ (1) The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	In evaluating investments in real estate, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P65_S1	Such information would be comparable only for non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activity and have other similar operating characteristics.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P65_S2	By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or third parties.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	Acquisition fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income and income from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S2	Such fees and expenses are paid in cash, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S3	Such fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S4	Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S5	All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S6	Acquisition fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S7	(2) Under GAAP, certain intangibles are accounted for at cost and reviewed at least annually for impairment, and certain intangibles are assumed to diminish predictably in value over time and amortized, similar to depreciation and amortization of other real estate related assets that are excluded from FFO.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S8	However, because real estate values and market lease rates historically rise or fall with market conditions, management believes that by excluding charges relating to amortization of these intangibles, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the performance of the real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P66_S9	(3) Management believes that adjusting for mark-to-market adjustments is appropriate because they may not be reflective of ongoing operations and reflect unrealized impacts on value based only on then-current market conditions, although they may be based upon current operational issues related to an individual property or industry or general market conditions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	Mark-to-market adjustments are made for items such as ineffective derivative instruments, certain marketable securities and any other items that GAAP requires we make a mark-to-market adjustment for.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	The need to reflect mark-to-market adjustments is a continuous process and is analyzed on a quarterly or annual basis in accordance with GAAP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P67_S2	(4) Under GAAP, rental receipts are allocated to periods using various methodologies.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P67_S3	This may result in income recognition that is significantly different than underlying contract terms.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P67_S4	By adjusting for these items (to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments), MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economic impact of lease terms and debt investments, providing insight on the contractual cash flows of such lease terms and debt investments, and aligns results with management's analysis of operating performance.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	Distributions On September 22, 2010, our board of directors authorized, and we declared, a distribution rate equal to $0.605 per annum per share of common stock, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	The distributions are payable by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , distributions paid to common stockholders totaled $36.6 million inclusive of $18.9 million of distributions for which common stock was issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P69_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P69_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , cash used to pay our distributions was primarily generated from cash flows provided by operations, issuances of common stock and common stock issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P69_S3	We have continued to pay distributions to our stockholders each month since our initial distribution payment in April 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P69_S4	There is no assurance that we will continue to declare distributions at this rate.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P69_S5	The following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to common stockholders for the period presented:
1474464_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	__________________ (1) Excludes distributions related to unvested restricted shares and Class B units.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P70_S1	(2) Cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 include acquisition and transaction related expenses of $17.4 million .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	The following table compares cumulative distributions paid to cumulative net loss (in accordance with GAAP) for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) through December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	__________________________________ (1) Net loss as defined by GAAP includes the non-cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense as well as acquisition and transaction related costs.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	Dilution Our net tangible book value per share is a mechanical calculation using amounts from our balance sheet, and is calculated as (1) total book value of our assets less the net value of intangible assets, (2) minus total liabilities less the net value of intangible liabilities, (3) divided by the total number of shares of common and preferred stock outstanding.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	It assumes that the value of real estate, and real estate related assets and liabilities diminish predictably over time as shown through the depreciation and amortization of real estate investments.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	Real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	Net tangible book value is used generally as a conservative measure of net worth that we do not believe reflects our estimated value per share.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S1	It is not intended to reflect the value of our assets upon an orderly liquidation in accordance with our investment objectives.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S2	Our net tangible book value reflects dilution in the value of our common and preferred stock from the issue price as a result of (i) operating losses, which reflect accumulated depreciation and amortization of real estate investments, (ii) the funding of distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations, and (iii) fees paid in connection with this offering, including commissions, dealer manager fees and other offering costs.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , our net tangible book value per share was $8.06 .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S4	The offering price of shares under our primary portion of our IPO (ignoring purchase price discounts for certain categories of purchasers) at December 31, 2013 was $10.00.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S5	The payment terms of our loan obligations require monthly principal and interest payments, with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S6	Our loan agreements stipulate that we comply with specific reporting covenants.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S7	As of December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S8	Our Advisor may, with the approval of our independent directors, seek to borrow short-term capital that, combined with secured mortgage financing, exceeds our targeted leverage ratio.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S9	Such short-term borrowings may be obtained from third parties on a case-by-case basis as acquisition opportunities present themselves simultaneous with our capital raising efforts.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S10	We view the use of short-term borrowings, including advances under our credit facility, as an efficient and accretive means of acquiring real estate in advance of raising equity capital.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S11	Accordingly, we can take advantage of buying opportunities as we expand our fundraising activities.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S12	As additional equity capital is obtained, these short-term borrowings and credit facility advances will be repaid.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P75_S13	Our secured debt leverage ratio was approximately 28.2% (total secured debt as a percentage of total real estate investments) as of December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	The following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 :
1474464_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	Lease Obligations We entered into lease agreements related to certain acquisitions under leasehold interest arrangements.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P77_S1	The following table reflects the minimum base rental cash payments due from us over the next five years and thereafter under these arrangements.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P77_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes among other items.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Election as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S1	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S2	We believe we are organized and operated in such a manner as to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S3	Inflation Some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S4	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S5	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S6	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P79_S7	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Related-Party Transactions and Agreements We have entered into agreements with affiliates of our Sponsor, whereby we have paid or may in the future pay certain fees or reimbursements to our Advisor, its affiliates and entities under common ownership with our Advisor in connection with acquisition and financing activities, sales and maintenance of common stock under our offering, transfer agency services, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P80_S1	See Note 13 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	In addition, the limited partnership agreement of the OP was amended as of December 31, 2013, to allow the special allocation, solely for tax purposes, of excess depreciation deductions of up to $50.0 million to our Advisor, a limited partner of the OP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P81_S1	In connection with this special allocation, our Advisor has agreed to restore a deficit balance in its capital account in the event of a liquidation of the OP and has agreed to provide a guaranty or indemnity of indebtedness of the OP.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Our Advisor is directly or indirectly controlled by certain officers and directors.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	In August 2013, we entered into a $220.0 million credit facility, which provided for aggregate revolving loan borrowings of up to $ 110.0 million and aggregate term loan borrowings of up to $110.0 million .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	On December 23, 2013, we amended the credit facility to decrease the aggregate revolving loan borrowings to $50.0 million and increased the aggregate term loan borrowings to $340.0 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P83_S2	The term loan component of the credit facility matures in August 2018 and the revolving loan component matures in August 2016.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P83_S3	The outstanding balance on the credit facility as of December 31, 2013 was $305.0 million and our unused borrowing capacity was $80.2 million , based on the value of the borrowing base properties as of December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	Availability of borrowings is based on a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	On February 25, 2014, we received $240.0 million of additional commitments to increase the aggregate borrowings available under our credit facility to up to $630.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
1474464_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	We have no other off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , our debt included fixed-rate secured mortgage notes payable and fixed-rate loans under our credit facility, with a carrying value of $252.7 million and a fair value of $253.4 million .
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the notes, but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flow.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2013 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $2.3 million .
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $2.4 million .
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S6	At December 31, 2013 our debt included a variable-rate revolving credit facility with a carrying and fair value of $225.0 million.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P0_S7	Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate credit facility affects interest expense incurred and cash flow.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2012 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate credit facility would increase or decrease our interest expense by $0.2 million annually.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2013 , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act, management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of such period, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act.
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	In connection with the preparation of our Form 10-K, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P0_S3	In making that assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P0_S4	Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2013 , our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P0_S5	The rules of the SEC do not require, and this annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding, internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1474464_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	During the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 , there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_14_ITEM10_P0_S0	The information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to our annual proxy statement to be filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (the "Proxy Statement").

1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S1	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. (a Maryland Corporation) and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S2	Our audits of the basic consolidated financial statements included the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S3	These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S7	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S8	Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P10_S9	Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P11_S1	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P11_S2	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	Note 1 Organization American Realty Capital New York Recovery REIT, Inc. (the "Company"), incorporated on October 6, 2009, is a Maryland corporation that qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	On September 2, 2010, the Company commenced its initial public offering (the "IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to 150.0 million shares of common stock, 0.01 par value per share, at a price of $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11, as amended (File No. 333-163069) (the "Registration Statement") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
1474464_14_ITEM15_P18_S2	The Registration Statement also covers up to 25.0 million shares available pursuant to a distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") under which the Company's common stockholders may elect to have their distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Company's common stock at the greater of 9.50 per share or 95% of the estimated value of a share of common stock.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P18_S3	On August 2, 2013, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-11 with the SEC to register a follow-on offering of up to 12.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share on a reasonable best efforts basis and 1.25 million shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP at $9.50 per share.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P18_S4	On November 27, 2013, the Company registered an additional 25.0 million shares to be used under the DRIP (including a direct stock component) pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3D (File No. 333-192576).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P18_S5	The new DRIP, including the direct stock component, became effective December 6, 2013 and, as permitted by the IPO prospectus, the Company reallocated the remaining DRIP shares from its IPO to the IPO s primary offering.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P18_S6	As of December 11, 2013, the Company closed the IPO following the successful achievement of its target equity raise.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had 174.1 million shares of common stock outstanding, including unvested restricted shares, converted shares of convertible preferred stock (the "Preferred Shares") and shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had received total proceeds from the IPO and the DRIP of $1.7 billion from the sale of 172.1 million shares of common stock, including shares issued under the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P19_S2	In addition, the Company sold 2.0 million Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $17.0 million in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act (the "Preferred Offering"), which terminated on September 2, 2010, the effective date of the Registration Statement.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P19_S3	On December 15, 2011, the Company exercised its option to convert the Preferred Shares into 2.0 million shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P19_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , the aggregate value of all issuances and subscriptions of common stock outstanding was $1.7 billion based on a per share value of $10.00 (or $9.50 for shares issued under the DRIP).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	The Company was formed to acquire income-producing commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, and, in particular, properties located in New York City, with a focus on office and retail properties.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P20_S1	All such properties may be acquired and operated by the Company alone or jointly with another party.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P20_S2	The Company may also originate or acquire first mortgage loans secured by real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P20_S3	The Company purchased its first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P20_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company owned 23 properties and real estate-related assets.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	Substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P. (the "OP"), a Delaware limited partnership.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	The Company has retained New York Recovery Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor") to manage its affairs on a day-to-day basis.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") serves as the Company's property manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P21_S3	Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of the IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P21_S4	The Advisor and the Property Manager are wholly owned entities of, and the Dealer Manager is under common ownership with, American Realty Capital III, LLC (the "Sponsor"), as a result of which, they are related parties and receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to the IPO and for the investment and management of the Company's assets.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P21_S5	These entities receive fees during the offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1474464_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated joint venture arrangements in which the Company has controlling financial interests.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P24_S1	The portions of the consolidated joint venture arrangements not owned by the Company are presented as noncontrolling interests as of and during the period consolidated.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P24_S2	All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	The Company evaluates its relationships and investments to determine if it has variable interests.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	A variable interest is an investment or other interest that will absorb portions of an entity s expected losses or receive portions of the entity s expected residual returns.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in an entity, it evaluates whether such interest is in a variable interest entity ( VIE ).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (1) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P26_S3	The Company consolidates any VIEs when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE s operations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	A variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P28_S1	Consideration of various factors include, but are not limited to, the Company s ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the entity s governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company continually evaluates the need to consolidate joint ventures based on standards set forth in GAAP.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P29_S1	In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, power to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P31_S0	Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, real estate taxes and derivative financial instruments and hedging activities, as applicable.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P32_S0	Real Estate Investments Investments in real estate are recorded at cost.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P32_S1	Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P32_S2	Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to 15 years for fixtures and capital improvements and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the Company's properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to the Company's investments in real estate.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P33_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on the Company's net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company's investments in real estate, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company is required to present the operations related to properties that have been sold or properties that are intended to be sold as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P34_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold are to be designated as "held for sale" on the balance sheet.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P35_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property's use and eventual disposition.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P36_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S0	Purchase Price Allocations The Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S1	Tangible assets include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements on an as-if vacant basis.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	The Company utilizes various estimates, processes and information to determine the as-if vacant property value.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S3	Estimates of value are made using customary methods, including data from appraisals, comparable sales, discounted cash flow analysis and other methods.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S4	Amounts allocated to land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements are based on cost segregation studies performed by independent third-parties or the Company's analysis of comparable properties in its portfolio.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S5	Identifiable intangibles include amounts allocated to acquire leases for above- and below-market lease rates, the value of in-place leases, and the value of customer relationships, as applicable.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S6	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to in-place leases is primarily the difference between the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and the property valued as if vacant.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S7	Factors considered in the analysis of the in-place lease intangibles include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up period for each property, taking into account current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S8	In estimating carrying costs, the Company includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at contract rates during the expected lease-up period, which typically ranges from six to 12 months.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P38_S9	The Company also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Above-market and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P39_S1	The capitalized above-market lease intangibles are amortized as a decrease to rental income over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P39_S2	The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining term and any fixed rate renewal periods provided within the respective leases.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	In determining the amortization period for below-market lease intangibles, the Company initially will consider, and periodically evaluate on a quarterly basis, the likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	The likelihood that a lessee will execute the renewal option is determined by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	The aggregate value of intangible assets related to customer relationships, as applicable, is measured based on the Company's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and the Company's overall relationship with the tenant.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P41_S1	Characteristics considered by the Company in determining these values include the nature and extent of the existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	The value of in-place leases is amortized to expense over the initial term of the respective leases, which range primarily from one to 29 years .
1474464_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event does the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of pre-acquisition due diligence, as well as subsequent marketing and leasing activities, in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and intangible liabilities assumed.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P44_S2	Intangible assets and acquired lease liabilities consist of the following:
1474464_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	The following table provides the weighted-average amortization and accretion periods as of December 31, 2013 , for intangible assets and liabilities and the projected amortization expense and adjustments to revenues for the next five years:
1474464_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Investments in unconsolidated joint venture The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in cases where the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control, the entities and is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	These investments are recorded initially at cost, as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P46_S2	Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the Company's balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is depreciated and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets and liabilities and included in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	Equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures is allocated based on the Company's ownership or economic interest in each joint venture.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	A loss in the value of a joint venture investment that is determined to be other than temporary is recognized in the period in which the loss occurs.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P47_S2	No such impairment losses were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had $234.8 million in investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P48_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company had no such investments.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P49_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P50_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company deposits cash with high quality financial institutions.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P50_S2	These deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the "FDIC") up to an insurance limit.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P50_S3	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 the Company had deposits of $233.4 million and $5.4 million , respectively, of which $228.8 million and $3.3 million , respectively, were in excess of the amount insured by the FDIC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P50_S4	Although the Company bears risk to amounts in excess of those insured by the FDIC, it does not anticipate any losses as a result.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves related to lease expirations as well as maintenance, structural, and debt service reserves as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1474464_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Deferred Costs, Net Deferred costs, net consists of deferred financing costs and deferred leasing costs.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P51_S3	These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P51_S4	Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P51_S5	Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	Deferred leasing costs, consisting primarily of lease commissions and payments made to assume existing leases, are deferred and amortized over the term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P53_S0	Share Repurchase Program The Company's board of directors has adopted a Share Repurchase Program ("SRP") that enables stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in limited circumstances.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P53_S1	The SRP permits investors to sell their shares back to the Company after they have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described below.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P53_S2	Prior to the time that the Company's shares are listed on a national securities exchange and until the Company establishes an estimated value for the shares, the purchase price per share will depend on the length of time investors have held such shares as follows: after one year from the purchase date the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after two years from the purchase date the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after three years from the purchase date the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; and after four years from the purchase date the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the amount they actually paid for each share (in each case, as adjusted for any stock distributions, combinations, splits and recapitalizations).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P53_S3	The Company will begin establishing an estimated value for its shares based on the value of its real estate and real estate-related investments beginning 18 months after the close of its offering.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P54_S0	Beginning 18 months after the completion of the last offering of the Company's shares (excluding offerings under the DRIP), the board of directors will determine the value of the properties and the other assets based on such information as the board determines appropriate, which may or may not include independent valuations of properties or of the Company as a whole, prepared by third-party service providers.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company is only authorized to repurchase shares pursuant to the SRP up to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP and will limit the amount spent to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP in that same quarter.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P54_S2	In addition, the board of directors may reject a request for redemption, at any time.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P54_S3	Due to these limitations, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P54_S4	Purchases under the SRP by the Company will be limited in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior year (or 1.25% per calendar quarter).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P55_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P56_S0	When a stockholder requests repurchases and the repurchases are approved by the Company's board of directors, it will reclassify such obligation from equity to a liability based on the settlement value of the obligation.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P56_S1	The following table reflects the number of shares repurchased for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	__________________________ Distribution Reinvestment Plan Pursuant to the DRIP, stockholders may elect to reinvest distributions by purchasing shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	No dealer manager fees or selling commissions are paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P57_S2	Participants purchasing shares pursuant to the DRIP have the same rights and are treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the IPO.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	The board of directors may designate that certain cash or other distributions be excluded from the DRIP.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P58_S1	The Company has the right to amend any aspect of the DRIP or terminate the DRIP with ten days' notice to participants.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	Shares issued under the DRIP are recorded to equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the period distributions are declared.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	Derivative Instruments The Company may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P61_S0	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and/or costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P61_S2	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P62_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P64_S1	The accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P64_S2	If the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P64_S3	If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P64_S4	Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P66_S0	Revenue Recognition The Company's revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P66_S1	Since many of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, straight-line basis accounting requires the Company to record a receivable, and include in revenues, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P66_S2	The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P66_S3	When the Company acquires a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P66_S4	The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P66_S5	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in the consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P67_S0	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company s hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P68_S1	Hotel revenues are recognized as earned.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P69_S3	As a result, these costs would only be a liability of the Company to the extent selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and other organization and offering costs did not exceed 11.5% of the gross proceeds determined at the end of offering.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P69_S4	As of the end of the IPO in December 2013, offering costs were less than 11.5% of the gross proceeds in the IPO (See Note 13 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements ).

1474464_14_ITEM15_P71_S1	If the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes its REIT taxable income to its stockholders, and so long as it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company distributed to its shareholders 100% of its ordinary taxable income for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	A TRS is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	The TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P76_S3	In the event the Company determines that it would not be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, the Company establishes a valuation allowance which offsets the previously recognized income tax benefit.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the TRSs for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P78_S0	Per Share Data Income (loss) per basic share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) less distributions declared on Preferred Shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding during such period.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P78_S1	Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments, such as stock options and unvested restricted stock, but uses the average share price for the period in determining the number of incremental shares that are to be added to the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	Reportable Segments The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P81_S2	The adoption of this guidance, which is related to disclosure only, did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P82_S1	The amendments allow an entity to initially assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P82_S2	An entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P82_S3	The amendments were effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P94_S0	Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture On October 30, 2013, the Company purchased a 48.9% equity interest in WWP Holdings, LLC ("Worldwide Plaza") for a contract purchase price of $220.1 million .
1474464_14_ITEM15_P94_S1	The purchase price reflected an agreed value for Worldwide Plaza of $1,325.0 million less $875.0 million of debt on the property.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	At acquisition, the Company's investment in Worldwide Plaza exceeded the Company's share of the book value of the net assets of Worldwide Plaza by $260.6 million .
1474464_14_ITEM15_P95_S2	This basis difference resulted from the excess of the Company's purchase price for the interest in the Worldwide Plaza over the book value of Worldwide Plaza's net assets.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P95_S3	Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated, based on the Company's estimates of the fair values of Worldwide Plaza's assets and liabilities, to real estate (land and buildings).
1474464_14_ITEM15_P95_S4	The Company amortizes the basis difference over the anticipated useful lives of the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P115_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P116_S0	Note 9 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the investment.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P116_S1	This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P117_S0	The guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P117_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P117_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P118_S0	The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P118_S1	In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P118_S2	The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P118_S3	However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P118_S4	Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P118_S5	However, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's derivatives.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P118_S6	As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P119_S0	The valuation of derivative instruments is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P119_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P119_S2	In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company's potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the counterparties.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P120_S0	The Company has investments in redeemable preferred stock that are traded in active markets and therefore, due to the availability of quoted market prices in active markets, classified these investments as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P120_S1	The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall:
1474464_14_ITEM15_P121_S0	A review of the fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P122_S0	Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P122_S1	There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_14_ITEM15_P123_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P124_S0	The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P124_S1	The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, prepaid expenses and other assets, due from affiliates, notes payable, accounts payable and distributions payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheet due to their short-term nature.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P124_S2	The fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet are reported below.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P125_S0	The fair value of mortgage notes payable and the fixed-rate portions of term loans on the credit facility are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Advisor's experience with similar types of borrowing arrangements.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P125_S1	Advances under the credit facility with interest rates which vary are considered to be reported at fair value.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P126_S0	Note 10 Derivatives and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, collars, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P126_S1	The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P126_S2	The Company does not intend to utilize derivatives for speculative or other purposes other than interest rate risk management.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P126_S3	The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements will not be able to perform under the agreements.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P126_S4	To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P126_S5	The Company does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P127_S0	Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P127_S1	To accomplish this objective, the Company may primarily use interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P128_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P128_S1	Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the floor strike rate on the contract.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P128_S2	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P128_S3	The Company uses such derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P128_S4	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company's variable-rate debt.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P128_S5	During the next 12 months , the Company estimates that an additional $2.0 million will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P129_S0	AMERICAN REALTY CAPITAL NEW YORK RECOVERY REIT, INC.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P130_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P136_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P136_S1	These derivatives are used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements to be classified as hedging instruments.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P136_S2	The Company does not have any hedging instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P138_S0	Credit-risk-related Contingent Features The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P138_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements was $1.0 million .

1474464_14_ITEM15_P138_S3	If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the aggregate termination value of $1.0 million at December 31, 2013 .

1474464_14_ITEM15_P139_S1	In September 2010, the Company's board of directors authorized, and the Company declared, a distribution rate equal to $0.605 per annum per share of common stock, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P139_S2	The distributions are paid by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month at a per share rate of 0.0016575342 per day.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P139_S3	The board of directors may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P140_S0	Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies Future Minimum Lease Payments The Company entered into lease agreements related to certain acquisitions under leasehold interest arrangements.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P140_S1	The following table reflects the minimum base rental cash payments due from the Company over the next five years and thereafter under these arrangements.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P140_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes among other items.

1474464_14_ITEM15_P142_S0	Litigation On October 15, 2013, RXR WWP Owner LLC ( RXR ) filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against American Realty Capital Properties, Inc. and the Company (collectively, the ARC Parties ) alleging that, under an agreement that RXR entered into with the co-defendant WWP Sponsor LLC dated May 30, 2013 (the May 30 Agreement ), RXR was entitled to acquire a 48.9% equity interest in the indirect owner of Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P142_S1	RXR claimed that the ARC Parties are liable for breach of a confidentiality agreement, tortious interference with the May 30 Agreement and tortious interference with prospective business relations.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P142_S2	RXR moved for a preliminary injunction barring the defendants from consummating the Worldwide Plaza transaction.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P142_S3	On October 30, 2013, the Court denied RXR s preliminary injunction motion, and the transaction was thereafter consummated.
1474464_14_ITEM15_P142_S4	On November 21, 2013 RXR filed an amended complaint adding the ARC Parties as parties to a permanent injunction claim that was previously asserted solely against the ARC Parties co-defendants.

1474464_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	These risks resulting from a lack of diversification may become even greater in the event of a downturn in the commercial real estate industry and could significantly adversely affect the value of our properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	A downturn in New York City s economy, in a submarket within New York City or in the overall national economy could, for example, result in reduced demand for office or lodging space.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Likewise, declines in the financial services or media sectors may have a disproportionate adverse effect on the New York City real estate market.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These adverse effects could be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of New York City.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Moreover, the New York City real estate market is highly competitive.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	The number of competing properties in the New York City market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities in New York City to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	There are also other REITs, including two non-traded REITs with similar investment objectives to ours, which are sponsored and advised by entities under common control with our Sponsor and our Advisor, with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others may be organized in the future.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to our company.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Therefore, we compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We face risks associated with property acquisitions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may acquire interests in properties, individual properties and portfolios of properties, including large portfolios that could significantly increase our size and alter our capital structure.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our acquisition activities may be exposed to, and their success may be adversely affected by, the following risks:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	we may continue to acquire properties without recourse, or with only limited recourse, for liabilities, whether known or unknown, such as cleanup of environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We rely on our Advisor to acquire properties on our behalf.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Because the management personnel of our Advisor are also engaged in the process of acquiring properties for other entities formed and managed by affiliates of our Advisor, we could suffer delays in locating suitable investments or may miss out on opportunities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If our Advisor is unable to obtain further suitable investments, we will not be able to continue to increase our asset base.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our growth and ability to successfully acquire properties depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control, which may affect our ability to seize strategic opportunities, satisfy debt obligations and pay dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Because of these dividend requirements, we may not be able to fund future capital needs, including any necessary acquisition financing, from operating cash flow.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Consequently, we may need to rely on third-party sources to fund our capital needs, including the acquisition of properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	For example, we have the right under the joint venture agreement related to our largest asset, our 48.9% interest in the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza, to purchase the balance of the equity interest in Worldwide Plaza beginning 38 months following the closing of the acquisition, or December 2016, at an agreed-upon value of $1.4 billion, subject to certain adjustments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources on favorable terms, in the time period we desire, or at all, we may not be able to make this purchase when we have the option to do so.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	If we were to not exercise our purchase option, we would be subject to a fee in the amount of $25.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We also may not be able to acquire or redevelop properties when other strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our principal and interest obligations or make the cash dividends to our stockholders necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	the market price per share of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We may not be able to quickly access capital markets.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Because our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 was not filed until May 2015, we will be ineligible to register our common stock or any other securities on Form S-3 for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the Exchange Act for at least twelve calendar months and any portion of a month from the original due date, or until April 2016.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We also are not eligible to use our currently effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the same time period.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The need to use other forms, such as Form S-11, to register our common stock or any other securities could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital in a short period of time because we will need to file a registration statement on Form S-11 to register any proposed public offering of securities and then wait for it to be declared effective by the SEC before we may proceed with the proposed public offering.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and as a result concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our independent registered public accounting firm reached the same conclusion.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Specifically, management concluded that we did not:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Maintain an effective control environment and risk assessment process, specifically:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Design and conduct an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze risks impacting financial reporting, and implement business process level controls and monitoring activities that are responsive to those risks.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Design and maintain appropriate controls over the authorization, completeness, existence and accuracy of manual journal entries.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	While the control deficiencies did not result in any material or immaterial misstatements in our financial statement accounts, the control deficiencies could increase the likelihood of inaccuracies in our financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our management concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and that, as a result, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Our independent registered public accounting firm reached the same conclusion.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Although management is in the process of developing and implementing a plan to remediate the deficiencies in internal control, there is no assurance that the plan will remediate the material weaknesses or ensure that our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, our ability to access the capital markets and our ability to provide accurate financial information.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire and achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	If tenants do not renew their leases upon expiration, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Even if the tenants do re-lease the lease or we are able to re-lease to a new tenant, the terms and conditions of the new lease may not be as favorable as the terms and conditions of the expired lease.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Moreover, we may fail to achieve the rental rate objectives we have set in order to prevent vacancies.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S9	If we do not achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases, our expenses could be greater, which may impact our results of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P11_S10	In addition, one or more of our properties may incur a vacancy either by the continued default of a tenant under its lease or the expiration of one of our leases.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The resale value of a property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend principally upon the value of the cash flow generated from the property which in the case of vacancies, will be reduced.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Tenant credit concentrations make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to those tenants.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The financial failure of any or all of these tenants is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, the value of our properties are driven in part by the credit quality of the underlying tenants, and an adverse change in the tenants' financial conditions or a decline in the credit rating of such tenants may result in a decline in the fair value of our investments and have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We also own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain thresholds or other targets, which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Accordingly, a decline in a tenant s may result in a decline in the rental income we receive and have a material adverse effect on our results from operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to pay dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	A bankruptcy filing by one of our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	There is no assurance the tenant or its trustee would agree to assume the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages and it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments that would mean a reduction in our cash flow and the amount available to pay dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Our properties may be subject to impairment charges.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	We periodically evaluate our real estate investments for impairment indicators.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, tenant performance and legal structure.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S12	For example, the early termination of, or default under, a lease by a tenant may lead to an impairment charge.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S13	If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make a downward adjustment to the net carrying value of the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Impairment charges also indicate a potential permanent adverse change in the fundamental operating characteristics of the impaired property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P15_S15	There is no assurance that these adverse changes will be reversed in the future and the decline in the impaired property s value could be permanent.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and therefore we may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Investments in real properties are relatively illiquid.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We may not be able to quickly alter our portfolio or generate capital by selling properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we need or desire to sell a property or properties, we cannot predict whether we will be able to do so at a price or on the terms and conditions acceptable to us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Further, we may be required to invest monies to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct these defects or to make these improvements.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Moreover, in acquiring a property, we may agree to restrictions that prohibit the sale of that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S8	These provisions would restrict our ability to sell a property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S9	We own a 48.9% interest in Worldwide Plaza, which represents our largest property investment, and the property cannot be sold without the consent of our joint venture partner.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S10	In addition, applicable provisions of the Code impose restrictions on the ability of a REIT to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Thus, we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing a property at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are dependent on our Advisor to provide us with executive officers and key personnel.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, Michael A. Happel, and our chief financial officer, Gregory W. Sullivan, and other key personnel of our advisor and our property manager, each of whom would be difficult to replace.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Our executive officers are also executive officers of two REITs with similar investment objectives to ours which are sponsored and advised by entities under common control with our Sponsor and our Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Competition for such skilled personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that our Advisor will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel capable of meeting the needs of our business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	We cannot guarantee that all, or any particular one of these key personnel, will continue to provide services to us or our Advisor, and the loss of any of these key personnel could cause our operating results could suffer.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	This could occur, among other ways, if another REIT under common control with our Advisor internalizes its advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S6	If that occurs, key personnel of our Advisor, who also are key personnel of the internalized advisor, could become employees of the other program and would no longer be available to our Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Further, we have not and do not intend to separately maintain key person life insurance on any of our Advisor s key personnel.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S8	Moreover, any adverse changes in the financial health of our Advisor or our Property Manager could negatively impact their ability to supply us with the key personnel necessary for successful operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S9	We also depend on these key personnel to maintain relationships with firms that have special expertise in certain services or detailed knowledge regarding real properties in the five boroughs of New York City, particularly in Manhattan.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S10	If we lose or are unable to obtain the services of highly skilled professionals capable of establishing or maintaining appropriate strategic relationships, our ability to acquire additional properties could be adversely affected and our results of operations could suffer.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S12	These changes may impact our profitability and ability to realize growth in the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P18_S13	Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage, including due to the non-renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, or the TRIA, could reduce our cash flows and the return on our stockholders investments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our general liability coverage, property insurance coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties may not be adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Similarly, we may not have adequate coverage against the risk of direct physical damage or to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Moreover, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters, that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Insurance risks associated with such catastrophic events could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	This risk is particularly relevant with respect to potential acts of terrorism.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	The TRIA, under which the U.S. federal government bears a significant portion of insured losses caused by terrorism, will expire on December 31, 2020, and there can be no assurance that Congress will act to renew or replace the TRIA following its expiration.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P19_S8	In the event that the TRIA is not renewed or replaced, terrorism insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain at reasonable costs or at all, which may result in adverse impacts and additional costs to us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in the cost or availability of insurance due to the non-renewal of the TRIA or for other reasons could expose us to uninsured casualty losses.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss, which may reduce the value of our stockholders investments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in lower dividends to stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Additionally, mortgage lenders insist in some cases that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Accordingly, to the extent terrorism risk insurance policies are not available at reasonable costs, if at all, our ability to finance or refinance our properties could be impaired.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, civilian unrest, or war may affect the markets in which we operate our business and our profitability.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Our properties are located in the New York MSA which has experienced, and remains susceptible, to terrorist attacks.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S10	In addition, any kind of terrorist activity or violent criminal acts, including terrorist acts against public institutions or buildings or modes of public transportation (including airlines, trains or buses) could have a negative effect on our business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S11	These events may directly impact the value of our assets through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S12	Although we may obtain terrorism insurance, we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage to fund any losses we may incur.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S13	The TRIA, which was designed for a sharing of terrorism losses between insurance companies and the federal government, will expire on December 31, 2020, and there can be no assurance that Congress will act to renew or replace it.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S14	See - Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage, including due to the non-renewal of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, or the TRIA, could reduce our cash flows and the return on our stockholders investments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S15	More generally, any terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including armed conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the worldwide financial markets and economy.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S16	Increased economic volatility could adversely affect our hotel properties ability to conduct their operations profitably or our ability to borrow money or issue capital stock at acceptable prices and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P20_S17	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters, may adversely affect our income and the cash available for any dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs to investigate or remediate contaminated properties, regardless of fault or whether the acts causing the contamination were legal.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, the presence of hazardous substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require material expenditures by us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Additionally, our tenants' operations, the existing condition of land when we buy it, operations in the vicinity of our properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, or activities of unrelated third parties, may affect our properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S8	In addition, there are various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations with which we may be required to comply, and that may subject us to liability in the form of fines or damages for noncompliance.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S9	State and federal laws in this area are constantly evolving, and we may be affected by such changes and be required to comply with new laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of most properties that we acquire; however, we will not obtain an independent third-party environmental assessment for every property we acquire.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P21_S10	In addition, any such assessment that we do obtain may not reveal all environmental liabilities or that a prior owner of a property did not create a material environmental condition not known to us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We may be required to spend substantial sums defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of co-venturers and disputes between us and our co-venturers.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Our largest investment, representing 29.3% of the rentable square feet in our portfolio as of December 31, 2014 , was our 48.9% in the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We may enter into other partnerships and co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments).
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding such joint ventures.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P23_S4	For example, under the Worldwide Plaza joint venture, our joint venture partner is the manager of the joint venture, although we have consent rights over all major decisions, such as the approval of the annual budget and any decision to sell or encumber the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Accordingly, these investments are subject to the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the co-venturer would have full control over the joint venture.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Investments in joint ventures may also, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their required capital contributions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Disputes between us and co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Consequently, actions by or disputes with co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our co-venturers.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Potential changes in U.S. accounting standards regarding operating leases may make the leasing of our properties less attractive to our potential tenants, which could reduce overall demand for our leasing services.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Under current authoritative accounting guidance for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant's balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting and have jointly released exposure drafts of a proposed accounting model that would significantly change lease accounting.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In March 2014, the FASB and IASB redeliberated aspects of the joint project, including the lessee and lessor accounting models, lease term, and exemptions and simplifications.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	The timing of the issuance of the final standards is uncertain.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	These changes may affect how the real estate leasing business is conducted.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This in turn could make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There are costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Our properties are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "Disabilities Act").
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial facilities" that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The Disabilities Act's requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties in compliance with the Disabilities Act or allocate the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with the Disabilities Act.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Our business could suffer in the event our Advisor or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations experiences system failures or cyber incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the internal information technology systems of our Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	As reliance on technology in our industry has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, the risk of a cyber incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and instructions from around the world have increased.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The remediation costs and lost revenues experienced by a victim of a cyber incident may be significant and significant resources may be required to repair system damage, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, loss of revenues and litigation, caused by any breaches.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	There also may be liability for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Although our Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, there can be no assurance that those measures will be sufficient, and any material adverse effect experienced by our Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations could, in turn, have an adverse impact on us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	If a sale-leaseback transaction is re-characterized in a tenant's bankruptcy proceeding, our financial condition and ability to pay dividends to you could be adversely affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We may enter into sale-leaseback transactions, whereby we would purchase a property and then lease the same property back to the person from whom we purchased it.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In the event of the bankruptcy of a tenant, a transaction structured as a sale- leaseback may be re-characterized as either a financing or a joint venture, either of which outcomes could adversely affect our business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re-characterized as a financing, we might not be considered the owner of the property, and as a result would have the status of a creditor in relation to the tenant.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In that event, we would no longer have the right to sell or encumber our ownership interest in the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Instead, we would have a claim against the tenant for the amounts owed under the lease, with the claim arguably secured by the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The tenant/debtor might have the ability to propose a plan restructuring the term, interest rate and amortization schedule of its outstanding balance.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	If confirmed by the bankruptcy court, we could be bound by the new terms, and prevented from foreclosing our lien on the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If the sale-leaseback were re- characterized as a joint venture, our lessee and we could be treated as co-venturers with regard to the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	As a result, we could be held liable, under some circumstances, for debts incurred by the lessee relating to the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Risks Associated with Real Estate-Related Debt and Other Investments Any real estate debt security that we originate or purchase is subject to the risks of delinquency and foreclosure.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	We may originate and purchase real estate debt securities, which are subject to numerous risks including delinquency and foreclosure and risks of loss.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Typically, we will not have recourse to the personal assets of our borrowers.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The ability of a borrower to repay a real estate debt security secured by an income-producing property depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property, rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We bear the risks of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the real estate debt security, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and limit amounts available for distribution to you.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	In the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower, the real estate debt security to that borrower will be deemed to be collateralized only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy (as determined by the bankruptcy court), and the lien securing the real estate debt security will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Foreclosure of a real estate debt security can be an expensive and lengthy process that could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed real estate debt security.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We also may be forced to foreclose on certain properties, be unable to sell these properties and be forced to incur substantial expenses to improve operations at the property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	In addition, the value of mortgage loan investments is impacted by changes in the value of underlying collateral (if any), interest rates, volatility and prepayment rates, among other things.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	mezzanine loans investments may be even more volatile because, among other things, the senior lender may be able to exercise remedies that protect the senior lenders but that result in us losing our investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Any hedging strategies we utilize may not be successful in mitigating our risks.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We have entered into hedging transactions to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	To the extent that we use derivative financial instruments in connection with these risks, we are exposed to credit, basis and legal enforceability risks.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Derivative financial instruments may include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In this context, credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Basis risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual risks, including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative contract.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We may not be able to manage these risks effectively.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P45_S3	We may invest in collateralized mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk and the risks of the securitization process.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	We may invest in CMBS, which may increase our exposure to credit and interest rate risk.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	We have not adopted, and do not expect to adopt, any formal policies or procedures designed to manage risks associated with our investments in CMBS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In this context, credit risk is the risk that borrowers will default on the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Interest rate risk occurs as prevailing market interest rates change relative to the current yield on the CMBS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	For example, when interest rates fall, borrowers are more likely to prepay their existing mortgages to take advantage of the lower cost of financing.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	As prepayments occur, principal is returned to the holders of the CMBS sooner than expected, thereby lowering the effective yield on the investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	On the other hand, when interest rates rise, borrowers are more likely to maintain their existing mortgages.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	As a result, prepayments decrease, thereby extending the average maturity of the mortgages underlying the CMBS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	CMBS are also subject to several risks created through the securitization process.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Subordinate CMBS are paid interest only to the extent that there are funds available to make payments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	To the extent the collateral pool includes delinquent loans, there is a risk that the interest payment on subordinate CMBS will not be fully paid.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Subordinate CMBS are also subject to greater credit risk than those CMBS that are more highly rated.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends to you will be adversely affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest Our Sponsor, Advisor, executive officers and other key personnel face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase and leasing of properties, and these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect our investment opportunities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We rely on our Sponsor and the executive officers and other key professionals at our Advisor and our Property Manager to identify suitable investment opportunities for us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Several of the other key professionals of our advisor are also the key professionals at the parent of our Sponsor and their other public programs, and our executive officers are also executive officers of American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. and American Realty Capital New York City REIT II, Inc., which are non-traded REITs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor that have investment objectives similar to ours.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	The investment opportunity allocation agreement we have entered into with American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. and will enter into with American Realty Capital New York City REIT II, Inc. (the Allocation Agreement ) provides that acquisitions of properties identified for acquisition by our Advisor or the advisors to American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. and American Realty Capital New York City REIT II, Inc. will be subject to rotation among us, American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. and American Realty Capital New York City REIT II, Inc. depending on which one of us has sufficient capital to acquire all or some of the property acquisitions and which of us most recently made a property acquisition.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	As a result, we will not be able to acquire all properties identified by our Advisor and its affiliates that we would otherwise have had the opportunity to acquire.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	In addition, other programs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor not subject to the Allocation Agreement own properties, or may seek to acquire properties, in the New York MSA.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S6	In such a case, a conflict could arise in the acquisition or leasing of properties if we and another program sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor were to compete for the same properties or tenants in negotiating leases, or a conflict could arise in connection with the resale of properties if we and another program sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor were to attempt to sell similar properties at the same time.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S7	Conflicts of interest also may exist at such time as we or our affiliates managing properties on our behalf seek to employ developers, contractors or building managers, as well as under other circumstances.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S8	Also, we may acquire properties from, or sell properties to, other programs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S9	If one of the other programs sponsored by the parent of our sponsor attracts a tenant that we are competing for, we could suffer a loss of revenue due to delays in locating another suitable tenant.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S10	Similar conflicts of interest may apply if our Advisor determines to make or purchase mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans or participations therein on our behalf, since other programs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor may be competing with us for these investments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S11	Our officers and directors face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with affiliated entities, which could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and to generate returns to you.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S12	Certain of our executive officers, including Michael Happel, chief executive officer and president, and Greg Sullivan, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, also are officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager and other affiliated entities, including the advisor and property manager of American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. and American Realty Capital New York City REIT II, Inc., which are non-traded REITs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor that have investment objectives similar to ours.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S13	Our directors also are directors of other non-traded REITs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S14	As a result, these individuals owe fiduciary duties to these other entities and their stockholders and limited partners, which fiduciary duties may conflict with the duties that they owe to us and our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S15	These conflicting duties could result in actions or inactions that are detrimental to our business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S16	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of new investments and management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) our purchase of properties from, or sale of properties, to affiliated entities, (c) the timing and terms of the investment in or sale of an asset, (d) development of our properties by affiliates, (e) investments with affiliates of our Advisor, and (f) compensation to our Advisor and its affiliates including our Property Manager.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P51_S17	Moreover, the management of multiple REITs by certain of the officers and other key personnel of our Advisor may significantly reduce the amount of time they are able to spend on activities related to us, which may cause our operating results to suffer.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the structure of the fees they receive, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Under our advisory agreement, the partnership agreement of our OP, and the OPP (as defined in Item 5.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	we have entered into with our OP and our Advisor, our Advisor and its affiliates are entitled to fees and LTIP units (as defined in Item 5.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Share-Based Compensation-2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement ) in our OP issued pursuant to the OPP that are structured in a manner intended to provide incentives to our Advisor to perform in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S3	However, because our Advisor does not maintain a significant equity interest in us and is entitled to receive substantial minimum compensation regardless of performance, our Advisor's interests are not wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S4	In that regard, our Advisor could be motivated to recommend riskier or more speculative investments in order for us to generate the specified levels of total return and assets that would entitle our Advisor to fees and increase the number of LTIP units that would be earned.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S5	There is no separate counsel for us and our affiliates, which could result in conflicts of interest, and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect the value of your investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S6	Proskauer Rose LLP acts as legal counsel to us and also represents our Advisor and some of its affiliates.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S7	There is a possibility in the future that the interests of the various parties may become adverse and, under the Code of Professional Responsibility of the legal profession, Proskauer Rose LLP may be precluded from representing any one or all such parties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S8	If any situation arises in which our interests appear to be in conflict with those of our Advisor or its affiliates, additional counsel may be retained by one or more of the parties to assure that their interests are adequately protected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P53_S9	Moreover, should a conflict of interest not be readily apparent, Proskauer Rose LLP may inadvertently act in derogation of the interest of the parties which could affect our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may be unable to pay or maintain dividends from cash available from operations or increase dividends over time.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	There are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash dividends to stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Dividends are based principally on cash available from our operations, but we have in the past been, and may again in the future be, required to borrow funds or sell assets to fund dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Actual cash available for dividends may vary substantially from estimates.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	There is no assurance that we will be able to pay or maintain our current level of dividends or that dividends will increase over time.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Dividends funded from anything other than cash flow from operations reduces the amount of capital available to invest in properties and other permitted investments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Moreover, our failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may fluctuate.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We depend on our OP and its subsidiaries for cash flow and we will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of our OP and its subsidiaries.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our only significant asset is and will be the general partnership interests we own in our OP.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We conduct, and intend to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our OP.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Accordingly, our only source of cash to pay our obligations is dividends from our OP and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S4	The limited partnership units of the OP ("OP units") held by our Advisor and its affiliates are also entitled to dividends from the OP in the same amount as shares of common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Until such time as the LTIP units held by our Advisor are fully earned in accordance with the provisions of the OPP, the LTIP units are entitled to dividends equal to 10% of the dividends made on the OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S6	After the LTIP units are fully earned, they are entitled to a catch-up dividend and then the same dividends as the OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S7	There is no assurance that our OP or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay dividends to us that will enable us to pay dividends to our stockholders, holders of OP units and holders of LTIP units from cash flows from operations or otherwise pay any other obligations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S8	Each of our OP's subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from these entities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S9	In addition, because we are a holding company, stockholder claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our operating partnership and its subsidiaries.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P59_S10	Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our OP and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy stockholder claims as stockholders only after all of our and our OP's and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Existing stockholders interests will be diluted if we issue additional shares.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Existing stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our charter currently authorizes us to issue 350 million shares of stock, of which 300 million shares are classified as common stock and 50 million are classified as preferred stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Our board of directors may amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock, or the number of authorized shares of any class or series of stock, or may classify or reclassify any unissued shares into the classes or series of stock without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S4	Except for preferred stock, all of our shares may be issued in the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S5	Existing stockholders likely will suffer dilution of their equity investment in us, if we: (a) sell additional shares in the future; (b) sell securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock; (c) issue shares of our common stock in a private offering of securities to institutional investors; (d) issue restricted share awards to our directors; or (e) issue shares to our Advisor or its affiliates, successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation as set forth under our advisory agreement or other agreements.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S6	In addition, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with an exchange of OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P60_S7	As of December 31, 2014, the Advisor and its affiliates, including certain of our current and former directors and executive officers, held 4,270,841 OP units, representing 2.6% of our fully diluted common stock outstanding.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	After owning an OP unit for one year, OP unit holders generally may, subject to certain restrictions, exchange OP units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock or, at the option of the operating partnership, a corresponding number of shares of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Advisor also held 8,880,579 LTIP units, representing 5.1% of our fully diluted common stock outstanding.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	LTIP units are convertible into OP units subject to being earned and vested and several other conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We may also issue OP units to sellers of properties acquired by us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P62_S2	If we issue preferred stock, the holders thereof will, upon liquidation, be entitled to receive distributions of liquidation proceeds prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Additionally, any preferred stock including convertible preferred stock or other securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for common stock that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and will result in dilution to owners of our common stock if converted, exercised or exchanged for common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Any preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay dividends to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of our common stock and diluting the interest of existing stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers, directors and our Advisor are limited, which could reduce your and our recovery against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S3	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation's best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S4	In addition, subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors, our officers and our Advisor and our Advisor's affiliates and permits us to indemnify our employees and agents.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S5	We and our stockholders also may have more limited rights against our directors, officers, employees and agents, and our Advisor and its affiliates, than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce your and our recovery against them.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S6	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents, or our Advisor and its affiliates in some cases.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S7	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P63_S8	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Similarly, this restriction further limits a stockholder's ability to sell shares.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired and may limit your ability to exit the investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P65_S2	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P68_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has exempted any business combination involving our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P71_S3	As a result, our Advisor and any of its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P71_S4	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P71_S5	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholder.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	"Control shares" are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P73_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Office Industry Risks Declines in overall activity in the New York MSA may adversely affect the performance of our office properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P74_S1	82% of our property holdings measured by rentable square feet as of December 31, 2014 are comprised of commercial office properties located in the New York MSA.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Our office properties may be adversely affected by market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Because our portfolio includes commercial office buildings located in the New York MSA, which has a relatively large number of financial and professional services sector, significant job losses in the financial and professional services sector, which may decrease demand for office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S3	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S5	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S6	Our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service debt and to pay dividends to our stockholders may be adversely affected by any decrease in occupancy and rental rates.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S7	The loss of anchor tenants for our office properties could adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S8	A lease termination by a tenant that occupies a large area of space in one of our office properties (commonly referred to as an anchor tenant) could impact leases of other tenants.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S9	Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of a lease termination by an anchor tenant or the closure of the business of an anchor tenant that leaves its space vacant, even if the anchor tenant continues to pay rent.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S10	Any such modifications or conditions could be unfavorable to us as the property owner and could decrease rents or expense recoveries.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P75_S11	In the event of default by an anchor tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We may be adversely affected by certain trends that reduce demand for office real estate.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Some businesses are rapidly evolving to increasingly permit employee telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P76_S2	These practices enable businesses to reduce their space requirements.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P76_S3	A continuation of the movement towards these practices could over time erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	Retail Industry Risks Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	A retail property's revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our common stock may be negatively impacted.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Some of our leases provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P77_S4	A number of our retail leases also include a percentage rent clause for additional rent above the base amount based upon a specified percentage of the sales our tenants generate.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P77_S5	Under those leases which contain percentage rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P78_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we may derive from percentage rent leases could decline upon a general economic downturn.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant's lease is terminated.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S1	These "co-tenancy" provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S8	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability and the return on your investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S9	Our retail tenants face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs, internet websites and telemarketing.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S10	Other retail centers within the market area of our properties may compete with our properties for customers, affecting their tenants' cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S11	In addition, some of our tenants' rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P82_S12	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Lodging Industry Risks Our hotel is subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	One of the properties we own is a hotel, subject to all the risks of the hotel industry.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Adverse trends in the hotel industry could adversely affect hotel occupancy and the rates that can be charged for hotel rooms as well as hotel operating expenses, and generally include:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate, as discussed below.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	We do not have control over the market and business conditions that affect the value of our lodging properties, and adverse changes with respect to such conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Hotel properties are subject to varying degrees of risk generally common to the ownership of hotels, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Adverse changes in any or all of these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, thereby adversely impacting our ability to service debt and to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P86_S2	In addition, the seasonality of the hotel industry can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and also may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, such as extreme or unexpectedly mild weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	To the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues, we may attempt to borrow in order to pay dividends to our stockholders or be required to reduce other expenditures or dividends to stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S1	As a REIT, we cannot directly operate our lodging properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, which could impact our ability to service debt and pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S2	We cannot and do not directly operate our lodging properties and, as a result, our results of operations, financial position, ability to service debt and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders are dependent on the ability of our third-party management companies and our tenants to operate our hotel properties successfully.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S3	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly operate any lodging properties or actively participate in the decisions affecting their daily operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S4	The lodging properties we acquire are leased to one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), which enter into property management agreements with our Property Manager, which, in turn, enters into agreements with third-party sub-property managers to operate the properties that we lease to a TRS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S5	We cannot and do not control this third-party management company, who is responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management of our lodging properties, including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S6	Thus, even if we believe our lodging properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party management company or the tenants to change their method of operation of our lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S7	Our results of operations, financial position, cash flows and our ability to service debt and to pay dividends to stockholders are, therefore, dependent on the ability of our third-party management company and tenants to operate our lodging properties successfully.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S8	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator and/or its affiliated brands generally may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and consequently cash flows thereby impacting our ability to service debt, and to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P87_S9	There can be no assurance that our affiliate will continue to manage any lodging properties we acquire.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We rely on a third-party hotel management companies to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We do not, however, control the design or implementation of or changes to internal controls at any of our lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Thus, even if we believe that our lodging properties are being operated without effective internal controls, we may not be able to require the third-party management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S3	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S4	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S5	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party management company will implement at our lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S6	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at one or more of our lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S7	If we replace a third-party management company, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at the affected lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S8	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party management company with substantial prior lodging experience in the future.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S9	If we experience such disruptions, it may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S10	Our use of the TRS structure increases our expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S11	A TRS structure subjects us to the risk of increased lodging operating expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S12	The performance of our TRSs will be based on the operations of our lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S13	Our operating risks include not only changes in hotel revenues and changes to our TRSs' ability to pay the rent due to us under the leases, but also increased hotel operating expenses, including, but not limited to, the following cost elements: wage and benefit costs; repair and maintenance expenses; energy costs; property taxes; insurance costs; and other operating expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S14	Any increases in one or more these operating expenses could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S15	Failure to maintain franchise licenses could decrease our revenues.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S16	The one hotel we owned as of December 31, 2014 was not subject to a franchise license but any hotels we acquire in the future may be subject to a franchise license.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S17	The inability to maintain franchise licenses could decrease our revenues.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S18	Maintenance of franchise licenses for our lodging properties is subject to maintaining our franchisor s operating standards and other terms and conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S19	Franchisors periodically inspect lodging properties to ensure that such lodging properties are maintained in accordance with their standards.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S20	Failure to maintain our lodging properties in accordance with these standards or comply with other terms and conditions of the applicable franchise agreement could result in a franchise license being canceled.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S21	If a franchise license terminates due to our failure to make required improvements or to otherwise comply with its terms, we may also be liable to the franchisor for a termination fee.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S22	As a condition to the maintenance of a franchise license, our franchisor could also require us to make capital expenditures, even if we do not believe the capital improvements are necessary, desirable, or likely to result in an acceptable return on our investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S23	We may risk losing a franchise license if we do not make franchisor-required capital expenditures.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S24	If our franchisor terminates the franchise license, we may try either to obtain a suitable replacement franchise or to operate the lodging property without a franchise license.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S25	The loss of a franchise license could materially and adversely affect the operations or the underlying value of the lodging property because of the loss associated with the brand recognition and/or the marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P88_S26	A loss of a franchise license for one or more lodging properties could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	There are risks associated with employing hotel employees.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S1	We are generally subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel employees.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S2	The lodging properties we acquire are leased to one or more TRSs, which enter into property management agreements with our Property Manager, which, in turn, enters into agreements with third-party sub-property managers to operate the properties that we lease to a TRS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Hotel operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in our consolidated results of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S4	As a result, although we do not directly employ or manage the labor force at our lodging properties, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S5	Our third-party sub-property manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each our lodging properties and for establishing and maintaining the appropriate processes and controls over such activities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S6	From time to time, the operations of our lodging properties may be disrupted through strikes, public demonstrations or other labor actions and related publicity.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S7	We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of the aforementioned disruptions, or contract disputes or other events.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S8	Our third-party sub-property managers may be targeted by union actions or adversely impacted by the disruption caused by organizing activities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S9	Significant adverse disruptions caused by union activities or increased costs affiliated with such activities could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our cash flows, including our ability to service debt and pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S10	The expanding use of Internet travel websites by customers can adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S11	The increasing use of Internet travel intermediaries by consumers may experience fluctuations in operating performance during the year and otherwise adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S12	Our Property Manager and any third-party property manager will rely upon Internet travel intermediaries such as Travelocity.com, Expedia.com, Orbitz.com, Hotels.com and Priceline.com to generate demand for our lodging properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S13	As Internet bookings increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from our property manager or any third-party property manager.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S14	Moreover, some of these Internet travel intermediaries are attempting to offer hotel rooms as a commodity, by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as three-star downtown hotel ) at the expense of brand identification.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S15	Consumers may eventually develop brand loyalties to their reservations system rather than to our property manager or any third-party property manager and/or our brands, which could have an adverse effect on our business because we will rely heavily on brand identification.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S16	If the amount of sales made through Internet intermediaries increases significantly and our property manager or a third-party property manager fails to appropriately price room inventory in a manner that maximizes the opportunity for enhanced profit margins, room revenues may flatten or decrease and our profitability may be adversely affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S17	Residential Industry Risks The short-term nature of our residential leases may adversely impact our income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S18	We own one residential property and may acquire additional residential properties in the future.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S19	If our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to re-let their units.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S20	Because substantially all our residential leases are or will be for apartments, they generally are or will be for terms of no more than one or two years.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P89_S21	If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or re-let the units then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment in real estate (such as mortgage payments, real estate taxes and maintenance costs) are generally not reduced when circumstances result in a reduction in rental income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	An economic downturn could adversely affect the residential industry and may affect operations for the residential properties that we acquire.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P91_S1	As a result of the effects of an economic downturn, including increased unemployment rates, the residential industry may experience a significant decline in business caused by a reduction in overall renters.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P91_S2	An economic downturn and any corresponding increase in unemployment rates may have an adverse effect on our operations if the tenants occupying the residential properties we acquire or have acquired cease making rent payments to us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P91_S3	Moreover, low residential mortgage interest rates could accompany an economic downturn and encourage potential renters to purchase residences rather than lease them.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Our residential properties may experience declines in occupancy rate due to a decline in residential mortgage interest rates.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	Industrial Industry Risks Potential liability as the result of, and the cost of compliance with, environmental matters is greater if we invest in industrial properties or lease our properties to tenants that engage in industrial activities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on such property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P94_S1	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We may invest in properties historically used for industrial, manufacturing and commercial purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P95_S1	Some of these properties are more likely to contain, or may have contained, underground storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products and other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P95_S2	All of these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Leasing properties to tenants that engage in industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities will cause us to be subject to increased risk of liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The presence of hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell, rent or pledge such property as collateral for future borrowings.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P96_S2	The demand for and profitability of our industrial properties may be adversely affected by fluctuations in manufacturing activity in the United States.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Our industrial properties may be adversely affected if manufacturing activity decreases in the United States.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P98_S0	Trade agreements with foreign countries have given employers the option to utilize less expensive non-US manufacturing workers.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P98_S1	The outsourcing of manufacturing functions could lower the demand for our industrial properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P98_S2	Moreover, an increase in the cost of raw materials or decrease in the demand of housing could cause a slowdown in manufacturing activity, such as furniture, textiles, machinery and chemical products, and our profitability may be adversely affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Our portfolio may be negatively impacted by a high concentration of industrial tenants in a single industry.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P98_S4	If we invest in industrial properties, we may lease properties to tenants that engage in similar industrial, manufacturing and commercial activities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P98_S5	A high concentration of tenants in a specific industry would magnify the adverse impact that a downturn in such industry might otherwise have to our portfolio.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P98_S6	We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Our business is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P99_S1	The total principal amount of our combined outstanding indebtedness, which generally comprises mortgage loans on our properties, our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's indebtedness and the term loan and revolving components of our unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility ) with Capital One, National Association, was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P99_S2	We rely on both secured and unsecured, variable rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P99_S3	We have also funded the payment of dividends with proceeds from debt.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P100_S0	We may borrow if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P100_S1	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P100_S2	If we are unable to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity, our financial condition and results of operations would likely be adversely affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P100_S3	Our substantial indebtedness and the cash flow associated with serving our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the risks that:
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P101_S0	if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) result in higher interest rates, increased interest expense would adversely affect net income, cash flow and our ability to service debt and pay dividends to stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P102_S0	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P102_S1	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of your investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P102_S2	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P102_S3	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P102_S4	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of dividends required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P103_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P103_S1	When we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the value of your investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S2	Covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness limit our operational and financial flexibility, and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S3	Our Credit Facility contains certain financial and operating covenants that limit our financial and operational flexibility.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S4	The operating covenants limit our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt, sell all or substantially all of our assets, make restricted payments (including dividends to our stockholders), engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates and take certain other actions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S5	Our Credit Facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S6	The mortgage loans we have, or may in the future enter into, include, and may include, other financial and operating covenants.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S7	These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that would otherwise be in our best interest.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S8	In the event that we fail to satisfy our covenants, we would be in default under our unsecured Credit Facility and may be required to repay our indebtedness with capital from other sources.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S9	Under such circumstances, other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P104_S10	Moreover, the presence of financial covenants could cause us to operate our business with a view toward compliance with such covenants, which might not produce optimal returns for shareholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Our available capacity under our Credit Facility depends on our borrowing base properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the outstanding balance of the term loan and revolving components of our Credit Facility was $305.0 million and $330.0 million , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S2	While the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility allow for total borrowings of up to $705.0 million with a $305.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving loan and contain an accordion feature to allow us, under certain circumstances and to the extent agreed to by our lenders, to increase the aggregate loan borrowings to up to $1.0 billion of total borrowings, the actual availability of borrowings under our Credit Facility for any period is based on our borrowing base properties.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S3	The unused borrowing capacity, based on our borrowing base properties as of December 31, 2014 , was $6.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S4	If the financial results of the borrowing base properties deteriorate, or if their values decline, the maximum availability under the Credit Facility may decline and we may be required to make mandatory repayments of principal outstanding to avoid a default under the Credit Facility, absent an amendment or waiver.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we used proceeds from the Credit Facility to make acquisitions, pay dividends and to fund working capital needs.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S6	If we are unable to borrow under our Credit Facility due to a decrease in the available capacity or for any other reason,, we may be prevented from acquiring additional properties, funding our working capital needs or our dividends to our stockholders, and other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P105_S7	A decrease in the available capacity under our Credit Facility could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S0	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S1	We have incurred substantial indebtedness, of which $555.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014 , among other things, bears interest at variable interest rates that have not been hedged against.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S2	Accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to you.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S3	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S4	U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S5	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S6	However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in our best interests, or inadvertently.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S7	Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S8	The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S9	Furthermore, any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service "IRS") and is not a guarantee that we will qualify, or continue to qualify, as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S10	Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S11	Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S12	Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S13	Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S14	Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S15	If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S16	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S17	Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S18	In addition, dividends to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to pay dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S19	If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S20	Even if we qualify as a REIT, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S21	Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P106_S22	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are "dealer" properties sold by a REIT (a "prohibited transaction" under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P107_S0	We may not distribute sufficient dividends to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P107_S1	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P107_S2	In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P107_S3	However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P108_S0	We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P108_S1	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P109_S0	To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P109_S1	This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P110_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P110_S1	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which dividends we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P110_S2	These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P110_S3	It is possible that we might not always be able to pay distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P111_S0	Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P111_S1	For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P111_S2	Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P112_S0	Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P112_S1	We intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS would incur corporate rate income taxes with respect to any income or gain recognized by it), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction, or (c) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with the requirements of the prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for properties that, among other requirements, have been held for at least two years.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P112_S2	Despite our present intention, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our operating partnership, but generally excluding TRSs will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P112_S3	Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P113_S0	A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P113_S1	Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P113_S2	A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P113_S3	Overall, no more than 25% of the gross value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P114_S0	A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P114_S1	We may operate our "qualified assets" through one or more TRSs that lease such properties from us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P114_S2	We may use our TRSs generally for other activities as well, such as to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P115_S0	A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P115_S1	In addition, the rules, which are applicable to us as a REIT, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P115_S2	If our leases to our TRSs are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P115_S3	Rents paid to our operating partnership by our TRSs pursuant to the lease of our "qualified assets" will constitute substantially all of our gross income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P115_S4	In order for such rent to qualify as "rents from real property" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P115_S5	If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S0	If our OP failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S1	We intend to maintain the status of our operating partnership as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S2	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our OP as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S3	In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that our OP could make to us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S4	This also would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S5	This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay dividends and the yield on your investment.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S6	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which our OP owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the OP.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S7	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S8	Our investments in certain debt instruments may cause us to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes even though no cash payments have been received on the debt instruments, and certain modifications of such debt by us could cause the modified debt to not qualify as a good REIT asset, thereby jeopardizing our REIT qualification.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S9	Our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S10	For example, we may acquire assets, including debt securities requiring us to accrue original issue discount ("OID") or recognize market discount income, that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S11	In addition, if a borrower with respect to a particular debt instrument encounters financial difficulty rendering it unable to pay stated interest as due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S12	As a result of the foregoing, we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S13	In such circumstances, we may be required to (a) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (b) borrow on unfavorable terms, (c) distribute amounts that would otherwise be used for future acquisitions or used to repay debt, or (d) make a taxable dividend of our shares of common stock as part of a dividend in which stockholders may elect to receive shares of common stock or (subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total dividend) cash, in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S14	Moreover, we may acquire distressed debt investments that require subsequent modification by agreement with the borrower.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S15	If the amendments to the outstanding debt are "significant modifications" under the applicable Treasury Regulations, the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us in a debt-for-debt taxable exchange with the borrower.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S16	This deemed reissuance may prevent the modified debt from qualifying as a good REIT asset if the underlying security has declined in value and would cause us to recognize income to the extent the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our adjusted tax basis in the unmodified debt.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S17	The failure of a mezzanine loan to qualify as a real estate asset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S18	In general, in order for a loan to be treated as a qualifying real estate asset producing qualifying income for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, the loan must be secured by real property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S19	We may acquire mezzanine loans that are not directly secured by real property but instead secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S20	In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan that is not secured by real estate would, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S21	Although the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law and in many cases it may not be possible for us to meet all the requirements of the safe harbor.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S22	We cannot provide assurance that any mezzanine loan in which we invest would be treated as a qualifying asset producing qualifying income for REIT qualification purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P116_S23	If any such loan fails either the REIT income or asset tests, we may be disqualified as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S0	We may choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case the stockholder may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of the cash dividends received by them.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S1	In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S2	In order to satisfy this requirement, we may pay dividends that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such dividends) at the election of each stockholder.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S3	Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of such dividends as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S4	As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash portion of the dividend received.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S5	Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a dividend of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such dividend or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such dividend.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S6	If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S7	Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such dividend and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S8	Various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock dividend are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P117_S9	No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock dividends, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock dividends have not been met.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S0	The taxation of amounts paid to our stockholders may be taxable as ordinary income, which may reduce your anticipated return from an investment in us.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S1	Amounts that we pay to our stockholders generally referred to herein as "dividends" will generally be taxable as ordinary income if paid out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income).
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S2	However, a portion of amounts paid to our stockholders may (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (2) be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from our TRSs, or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that the payment exceeds our accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S3	A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S4	Our stockholders may have tax liability on amounts that they elect to reinvest in common stock, but they would not receive the cash to pay any resulting tax liability.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S5	Stockholders who participated in our DRIP will have been deemed to have received, and for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be taxed on, the amount reinvested in shares of our common stock to the extent the amount reinvested was not a tax-free return of capital.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S6	In addition, our stockholders will be treated for tax purposes as having received an additional amount to the extent the shares are purchased at a discount to fair market value.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P118_S7	As a result, unless a stockholder is a tax-exempt entity, it may have to use funds from other sources to pay its tax liability on the value of the shares of common stock received.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P119_S0	Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P119_S1	Currently, the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P119_S2	Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P119_S3	Although this does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P120_S0	Tax rates could be changed in future legislation.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P121_S0	If we were considered to actually or constructively pay a "preferential dividend" to certain of our stockholders, our status as a REIT could be adversely affected.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P121_S1	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P121_S2	A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the dividend is pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P122_S0	Currently, there is uncertainty as to the IRS's position regarding whether certain arrangements that REITs have with their stockholders could give rise to the inadvertent payment of a preferential dividend (e.g., the pricing methodology for stock purchased under a dividend reinvestment plan inadvertently causing a greater than 5% discount on the price of such stock purchased).
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P123_S0	While we believe that our operations have been structured in such a manner that we will not be treated as inadvertently paying preferential dividends, there is no de minimis exception with respect to preferential dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P123_S1	Therefore, if the IRS were to take the position that we inadvertently paid a preferential dividend, we may be deemed either to (a) have distributed less than 100% of our REIT taxable income and be subject to tax on the undistributed portion, or (b) have distributed less than 90% of our REIT taxable income and our status as a REIT could be terminated for the year in which such determination is made if we were unable to cure such failure.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P124_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P124_S1	The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P124_S2	Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P124_S3	To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P124_S4	As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P124_S5	This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P124_S6	In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P125_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forego and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S1	The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S2	In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) and no more than 25% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S4	As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S5	These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S6	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S7	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S8	While we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in our best interests.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P126_S9	If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P127_S0	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the market price of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P128_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P128_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we cannot assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P128_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P128_S3	You are urged to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on your investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P128_S4	You also should note that our counsel's tax opinion is based upon existing law, applicable as of the date of its opinion, all of which will be subject to change, either prospectively or retroactively.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P129_S0	Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P129_S1	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P129_S2	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P129_S3	The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our shares of stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S1	Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares of stock under this requirement.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S2	Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S3	To help insure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of our shares of stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S4	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT while we so qualify.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S5	Unless exempted by our board of directors, for so long as we qualify as a REIT, our charter prohibits, among other limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock, any person from beneficially or constructively owning (applying certain attribution rules under the Code) more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S6	Our board of directors may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would result in the termination of our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S7	These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S8	These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S9	Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S10	If we enter into sale-leaseback transactions, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to structure any such sale- leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a "true lease" for tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S11	The IRS may, however, challenge the characterization.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S12	In the event that any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to the property would be disallowed.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S13	If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification "asset tests" or "income tests" and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P130_S14	Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P131_S0	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P131_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, amounts paid by us to our stockholders will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P131_S2	These dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the dividends are treated as "effectively connected" with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P132_S0	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ("FIRPTA") capital gain dividends attributable to sales or exchanges of "U.S. real property interests" ("USRPIs") generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P132_S1	However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 5% of the class of our stock at any time during the one- year period ending on the date the dividend is received.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P132_S2	Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P132_S3	Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a "domestically-controlled qualified investment entity".
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P132_S4	A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT's stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P132_S5	We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically- controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P132_S6	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if (a) our common stock is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P133_S0	Potential characterization of dividends or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax- exempt investors.
1474464_15_ITEM1A_P133_S1	If (a) we are a "pension-held REIT," (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred (or is deemed to have incurred) debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Code.

1474464_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	Dividends We have elected to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders annually.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P0_S3	The amount actually paid to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including the amount of funds available, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, the restricted payments covenant in our Credit Facility, as applicable, and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P0_S4	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors approved, and we declared, a dividend rate equal to a $0.605 per share, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P0_S5	The dividend was paid to stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P0_S6	In April 2014, our board of directors changed the annualized rate to $0.46 per share per annum, beginning with the April 2014 distribution.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	Beginning in April 2014, payments are made to stockholders of record at the close of business on the 8th day of each month, and payable on the 15th day of such month.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , 93.1% , or $0.563 per share per annum, and 6.9% , or $0.042 per share per annum, represented a return of capital and ordinary dividends, respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	Payments to our stockholders in respect of their shares are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P2_S1	These payments are also dependent on our remaining in compliance with the restricted payments covenant in our Credit Facility.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P2_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with this covenant.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P2_S3	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of dividends or distributions paid or suspend payments at any time.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P2_S4	The following table reflects distributions paid in cash and reinvested through the DRIP to common stockholders as well as dividends related to unvested restricted stock, participating LTIP units, OP units and Class B units during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1474464_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , cash used to pay our dividends or distributions was generated mainly from funds received from cash flows provided by operations, proceeds from common stock, proceeds from common stock issued under the DRIP, proceeds from our Credit Facility and distributions from Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	As our portfolio of investments stabilizes, we expect that we will use funds received from operating activities to pay a greater proportion of our dividends or distributions and will be able to reduce and in the future eliminate the use of funds from financings to pay dividends or distributions .
1474464_15_ITEM5_P3_S2	As the cash flows from operations become more significant our Advisor and Property Manager may discontinue their past practice of forgiving fees and providing contributions and may charge the full fee owed to it in accordance with our agreements.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P3_S3	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of dividends or distributions paid or suspend dividend or distribution payments at any time and therefore these payments are not assured.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	Share-Based Compensation Plans We have a stock option plan (the "Plan") which authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options to our independent directors, subject to the absolute discretion of the board of directors and the applicable limitations of the Plan.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P4_S1	The exercise price for all stock options granted under the Plan to the independent directors is the fair market value of the award on the date of grant.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	Notwithstanding any other provisions of our Plan to the contrary, no stock option issued pursuant thereto may be exercised if such exercise would jeopardize our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P5_S1	The following table sets forth information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our stock option plan and our restricted share plan (as described below) as of December 31, 2014 :
1474464_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	__________________ (1) Includes the total number of shares of restricted stock that are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2014 , which is calculated as 10% of our outstanding shares of capital stock on a fully diluted basis.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	We have an employee and director incentive restricted share plan (the "RSP") that, prior to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE (the "Listing"), provided for the automatic grant of 3,000 restricted shares of common stock to each of the independent directors, without any further action by our board of directors or the stockholders, on the date of initial election to the board of directors and on the date of each annual stockholder's meeting.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P7_S1	Restricted stock issued to independent directors vested over a five-year period following the date of grant in increments of 20% per annum.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P7_S2	Subsequent to the Listing, we amended the RSP to, among other things, remove the fixed amount of shares that are automatically granted to the independent directors.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P7_S3	Under the amended RSP, the annual amount granted is determined by the board of directors.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P7_S4	Generally, such awards provide for accelerated vesting of (i) all unvested shares upon a "change in control" or a "termination without cause" (as described below) and (ii) the portion of the unvested shares scheduled to vest in the year of termination upon a voluntary termination or failure to be re-elected to the board.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P8_S0	The RSP provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain consultants to us and the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P9_S0	For purposes of the RSP, change in control means: (i) any person as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under any employee benefit plan of the Company or any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of stock of the Company), is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 50.1% or more of the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding voting securities; (ii) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other entity or approve the issuance of voting securities in connection with a merger or consolidation of the Company (or any direct or indirect subsidiary thereof) pursuant to applicable exchange requirements, other than (A) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving or parent entity) at least 50.1% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving or parent entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation or (B) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no person (as defined above) is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 50.1% or more of either of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock or the combined voting power of the Company s then outstanding voting securities; or (iii) the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company s assets (or any transaction or series of transactions within a period of 12 months ending on the date of the last sale or disposition having a similar effect).
1474464_15_ITEM5_P10_S0	For purposes of the RSP, a termination without cause is defined as a termination of the independent director s directorship by the Company other than for Cause (as defined below) or as a result of the independent director s death or disability.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P11_S0	Cause shall mean (x) the independent director s willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of his or her duties for the Company or any affiliate of the Company that is not cured by the independent director within 30 days after his or her receipt of written notice from the Company or such affiliate (as applicable); (y) the independent director s conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a crime relating to the Company or any affiliate of the Company, or any felony; or (z) a material breach by the independent director of the independent director s agreement, offer letter or other offer arrangement with the Company (if any) or any other material written agreement entered into between the independent director and the Company or any affiliate thereof (if any) that is not cured by the independent director within 30 days after his or her receipt of written notice from the Company or such affiliate (as applicable).
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S0	Prior to March 31, 2014, the total number of shares of common stock granted under the RSP could not exceed 5.0% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis at any time, and in any event could not exceed 7.5 million shares (as such number may be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and similar events).
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S1	On March 31, 2014, we adopted an amendment to our RSP to increase the number of shares of our capital stock, par value $0.01 per share, available for awards thereunder to 10% of our outstanding shares of capital stock on a fully diluted basis at any time.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S2	The amendment also eliminated the RSP limit of 7.5 million shares of capital stock.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S3	Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S4	Holders of restricted shares may receive cash dividends prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S5	Any dividends payable in common shares shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , we had 89,499 unvested restricted shares outstanding that were granted pursuant to the RSP.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S7	2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement On April 15, 2014 (the "Effective Date") in connection with the Listing, we entered into the 2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement (the "OPP") with the OP and the Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S8	Under the OPP, the Advisor was issued 8,880,579 long term incentive plan ("LTIP units") in the OP with a maximum award value on the issuance date equal to 5.0% of our market capitalization (the OPP Cap ).
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S9	The LTIP units are structured as profits interest in the OP.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P12_S10	The Advisor will be eligible to earn a number of LTIP units with a value equal to a portion of the OPP Cap upon the first, second and third anniversaries of the Effective Date based on our achievement of certain levels of total return to our stockholders ( Total Return ), including both share price appreciation and common stock dividends, as measured against a peer group of companies, as set forth below, for the three-year performance period commencing on the Effective Date (the Three-year Period each 12 -month period during the Three -Year Period (the One-Year Periods and the initial 24 -month period of the Three -Year Period (the Two-Year Period ), as follows:

1474464_15_ITEM5_P20_S0	The potential outperformance award is calculated at the end of each One-Year Period, the Two-Year Period and the Three-Year Period.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P20_S1	The award earned for the Three-Year Period is based on the formula in the table above less any awards earned for the Two-Year Period and One-Year Periods, but not less than zero; the award earned for the Two-Year Period is based on the formula in the table above less any award earned for the first and second One-Year Period, but not less than zero.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P20_S2	Any LTIP units that are unearned at the end of the Performance Period will be forfeited.

1474464_15_ITEM5_P22_S0	On April 15, 2014, the Class B units were converted to OP units on a one-to-one basis.
1474464_15_ITEM5_P23_S0	Upon occurrence of the Listing, the New York Recovery Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the "SLP") became entitled to begin receiving dividends of net sale proceeds pursuant to its special limited partner interest in the OP (the "SLP Interest") in an aggregate amount that is evidenced by the issuance of a note by the OP (the "Listing Note").
1474464_15_ITEM5_P24_S0	The principal amount of the Listing Note was determined based, in part, on the actual average market value of our outstanding common stock for the period 180 days to 210 days after the Listing.

1474464_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	Since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, GAAP accounting requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P0_S5	We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P0_S6	When we acquire a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	For the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, we evaluate whether we own or the tenant owns the tenant improvements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	When we are the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is when such improvements are substantially complete.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	When we conclude that we are not the owner (as the tenant is the owner) of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	When we conclude that we are the owner of tenant improvements, we record the cost to construct the tenant improvements, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants, as a capital asset.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	When we conclude that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred leasing costs, net on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	We will continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we will record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our hotel revenues are recognized as earned and are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	We may own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, we defer the recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	If we own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income, contingent rental income will be included in rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Investments in Real Estate We evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	In business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and noncontrolling interests based on their respective estimated fair values.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above and below market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	The fair value of above-market or below-market leases is recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the comparable fair market lease rate, measured over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	The fair value of other intangible assets, such as real estate tax abatements, are recorded based on the present value of the expected benefit and amortized over the expected useful life including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P9_S4	Fair values of assumed mortgages, if applicable, are recorded as debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above- or below-market interest rates.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P9_S5	Non-controlling interests in property owning entities are recorded based on the fair value of units issued at the date of acquisition, as determined by the terms of the applicable agreement.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	We utilize a number of sources in making our estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price including real estate valuations, prepared by independent valuation firms.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	We also consider information and other factors including: market conditions, the industry in which the tenant operates, characteristics of the real estate such as location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We present the operations related to properties that have been, or are intended to be, sold as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) where the disposal of a component represents a strategic shift that has had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold will be designated as "held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs for all periods presented when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Depreciation and Amortization We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the components of our real estate investments for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	These assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our real estate investments, we would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Acquired above-market leases are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	Acquired below-market leases are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	Acquired above-market ground leases are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P14_S3	Acquired below-market ground leases are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option period.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P14_S4	The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P14_S5	Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	If such estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is based on the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P15_S5	These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	We use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our borrowings.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Derivatives also may be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended the requirements for reporting discontinued operations.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Under the revised guidance, in addition to other disclosure requirements, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the component or group of components meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, disposed of by sale or other than by sale.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	We have adopted the provisions of this guidance effective January 1, 2014, and has applied the provisions prospectively.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	Early adoption is not permitted under GAAP.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	In April 2015, the FASB proposed a one-year delay of the revised guidance, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P22_S6	We have not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance relating to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, the guidance requires management to disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand the conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of the conditions or events that led to the doubt and management's plans that are intended to mitigate the conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	We have elected to adopt the provisions of this guidance effective December 31, 2014, as early application is permitted.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P23_S5	The adoption of this guidance had no material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships) and provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	If we decide to early adopt the revised guidance in an interim period, any adjustments will be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	If we decide to early adopt the revised guidance in an interim period, any adjustments will be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Results of Operations As of December 31, 2014 , we owned 24 properties and real estate-related assets.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	Properties for detail of the types of properties that we owned as of December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	As of January 1, 2013, we owned 16 properties (our "Same Store").
1474464_15_ITEM7_P27_S3	We acquired eight properties and real estate related assets from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 (our "Acquisitions").
1474464_15_ITEM7_P27_S4	Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , reflect significant increases in most categories.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P27_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , net loss attributable to stockholders was $93.0 million compared to $19.3 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P27_S6	The following is a summary of our quarterly leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2014 :
1474464_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	_______________ (1) Replacement leases are for space that was leased during the period that was previously leased to another expired or terminated tenant at some time during the prior twelve months.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 to Year Ended December 31, 2013 Rental Income Rental income increased $67.7 million to $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	The increase in rental income was primarily driven by our Acquisitions, which resulted in an increase in rental income of $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 as well as lease termination fees of $1.6 million related to a partial lease termination and modification at 229 West 36th Street.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	This was partially offset by a net decrease in rental income in our Same Store of $0.8 million primarily due to net leasing activity at 416 Washington Street as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	The terminated space at 416 Washington Street was re-leased in September 2014, resulting in a fully occupied property as of December 31, 2014.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S4	We also began self managing the garage at 416 Washington Street in December 2013 through a third-party national operator.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S5	Parking revenue associated with self management is higher than the rental income we would have received; however, this parking revenue is included in operating expense reimbursements and other revenue.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S6	Operating Expense Reimbursements and Other Revenue Operating expense reimbursements and other revenue increased $11.5 million to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to our Acquisitions, which resulted in an increase of $10.6 million .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S7	Operating expense reimbursements and other revenue at our Same Store increased $0.9 million , primarily related to parking revenue due to the switch to self managing the garage at 416 Washington Street in December 2013 and an increase in property operating expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S8	Pursuant to many of our lease agreements, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of certain property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S9	Therefore, operating expense reimbursements are directly affected by changes in property operating expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S10	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $24.6 million to $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S11	The increase in property operating expenses primarily related to real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and ground rent associated with our Acquisitions, which resulted in an increase of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S12	Property operating expenses increased $0.6 million in our Same Store, primarily related to increased real estate taxes, utilities, security and maintenance expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S13	This increase was partially offset by absorption of certain property operating costs of $0.6 million by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S14	The Advisor did not absorb any property operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S15	Hotel Revenue and Operating Expenses Hotel revenues increased $20.4 million to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S16	Hotel operating expenses increased $21.3 million to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S17	The increase in hotel revenues and hotel operating expenses related to a full year of operations at the Viceroy Hotel, which we purchased in November 2013.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P29_S18	Operating Fees to Affiliates Operating fees to affiliates were $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Operating fees to affiliates represent asset management fees earned by the Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Prior to the Listing, we issued the Advisor restricted performance based Class B units for prior asset management services, which vested as of the Listing.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	As such, there were no operating fees to affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Our Property Manager is entitled to fees for the management of our properties.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenues.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	Our Property Manager elected to waive these fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we would have incurred property management fees of $1.7 million and $0.8 million , respectively, had these fees not been waived.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 include $4.4 million relating to our acquisition of 245-249 West 17th Street as well as Listing-related costs.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	Listing-related costs mainly consist of $8.9 million of investment banking, advisory and other services provided by the Dealer Manager and its affiliates, as well as $2.8 million of other third party fees and expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P32_S6	Acquisition and transaction related expense of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $17.8 million for the purchase of seven properties during the period, partially offset by a reimbursement by the Advisor of $2.5 million for expenses and legal reimbursements paid on previous acquisitions.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Vesting of Asset Management Fees Vesting of asset management fees expense of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to the vesting of Class B units previously issued to the Advisor for asset management services.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The performance condition related to these Class B units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	On April 15, 2014, the Class B units were converted to OP units on a one-to-one basis.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	Value of Listing Promote Value of listing promote expense of $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the final value of the Listing Note.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	See Note 9 - Subordinated Listing Distribution of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $11.3 million to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily related to an increase in equity-based compensation and professional fees to support our larger real estate portfolio and operations as a traded REIT subsequent to Listing.

1474464_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	Prior to the Termination Date, the Advisor received financing coordination fees of $2.4 million , $6.6 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	See Note 14 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Reimbursement of Advisor's Expenses We reimburse the Advisor for costs and expenses of providing services, subject to the limitations set forth in our charter and advisory agreement with the Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	No reimbursement was made to the Advisor or paid by us for providing administrative services for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	The lack of reimbursement to the Advisor of its expenses improves our operating cash flows and our ability to fund dividends from operating cash flows.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	Additionally, the Advisor absorbed $2.0 million , $1.5 million and $1.0 million of our property operating and general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Principal Use of Funds Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2014 , we owned 24 properties and real estate-related assets.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our Advisor is actively and continuously evaluating potential acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related assets and engages in negotiations with sellers and borrowers on our behalf.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	In connection with our acquisition of properties, our Advisor received an acquisition fee equal to 1.0% of the contract purchase price of each acquired property including debt assumed or borrowed in connection with the acquisition.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Amended Advisory Agreement terminated the acquisition fee at the Termination Date, except for fees with respect to properties under contract, letter of intent or under negotiation as of the Termination Date (See Note 14 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).
1474464_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	In connection with the leasing of our properties, we have entered and will continue to enter into agreements with our tenants to provide allowances for tenant improvements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	These allowances require us to fund capital expenditures up to amounts specified in our lease agreements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	We intend to fund these allowances with cash on hand, cash flows from operations or proceeds from our credit facility.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	See Note 7 - Credit Facility in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	On April 15, 2014, we commenced the Tender Offer to purchase up to 23.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $10.75 per share.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	The Tender Offer closed on May 12, 2014 and we purchased 14.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $10.75 per share, for an aggregate of $152.3 million , excluding fees and expenses relating to the Tender Offer and including fractional shares repurchased thereafter.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	We funded the Tender Offer using cash on hand.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	Strategic Alternatives Fees In October 2014, we entered into separate transaction management agreements with Barclays Capital Inc. and RCS Capital, the investment banking and capital markets division of the Dealer Manager, as financial advisors to assist us and our board of directors in evaluating strategic options to enhance long-term shareholder value, including a business combination involving us or our sale.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	Pursuant to the agreement with RCS Capital, we will pay to RCS Capital a transaction fee upon the consummation of a transaction equal to 0.25% of the transaction value.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Pursuant to the agreement with Barclays Capital Inc., we will pay to Barclays Capital Inc.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	a transaction fee based on the transaction value.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	This section includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations, Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income and Cash Net Operating Income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, is provided below.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( FFO ), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure but is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the White Paper ).
1474464_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property but including asset impairment writedowns, plus depreciation and amortization, after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT s definition.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time, especially if not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	However, FFO, core funds from operations ("Core FFO") and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO ), as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P59_S4	In calculating FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition (as we do) or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do and/or calculate Core FFO and/or AFFO differently than we do.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P59_S5	Consequently, our presentation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	We consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	Because FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs in our peer group.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Core FFO is FFO, excluding acquisition and transaction related costs, other costs that are considered to be non-recurring, such as charges relating to the Listing Note, non-recurring revenue, such as lease termination or modification fees, and other non-recurring expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to pay dividends or other amounts to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction related costs as well as non-recurring revenues and expenses, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	We exclude certain income or expense items from AFFO that we consider more reflective of investing activities, other non-cash income and expense items and the income and expense effects of other activities that are not a fundamental attribute of our business plan.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S1	These items include unrealized gains and losses, which may not ultimately be realized, such as gains or losses on derivative instruments, gains or losses on contingent valuation rights, gains and losses on investments and early extinguishment of debt.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S2	We also exclude dividends on Class B units as the related shares are assumed to have converted to common stock in our calculation of fully diluted weighted average shares of common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S3	In addition, by excluding non-cash income and expense items such as amortization of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs, straight-line rent and equity-based compensation from AFFO, we believe we provide useful information regarding income and expense items which have no cash impact and do not provide liquidity to the company or require capital resources of the company.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S4	Similarly, we include items such as free rent credits paid by sellers in our calculation of AFFO because these funds are paid to us during the free rent period and therefore improve our liquidity.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S5	By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance without the impacts of transactions that are not related to the ongoing profitability of our portfolio of properties.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S6	We also believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S7	Further, we believe AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies that are not making a significant number of acquisitions.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P65_S8	Investors are cautioned that AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as it excludes certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	In calculating AFFO, we exclude certain expenses, which under GAAP are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S1	These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S2	All paid and accrued merger, acquisition and transaction related fees and certain other expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred or properties are acquired will also have negative effects on returns to investors, the ability to fund dividends or distributions in the future, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property and certain other expenses.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S3	AFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to companies that did not have such activities.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S4	Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S5	In addition, we view fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S6	We view both gains and losses from fair value adjustments as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S7	Excluding income and expense items detailed above from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S8	Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S9	By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P66_S10	As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The table below reflects the items deducted from or added to net income (loss) in our calculation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO during the periods presented.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P67_S1	Items are presented net of non-controlling interest portions where applicable.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	___________________________ (1) Proportionate share of depreciation and amortization related to unconsolidated joint venture and amortization of difference in basis.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income, Cash Net Operating Income and Adjusted Cash Net Operating Income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	We believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related expenses, other non-cash items and including our pro-rata share from unconsolidated joint ventures ("Adjusted EBITDA") is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and service debt.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P70_S1	Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating activities.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P70_S2	Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that of other REITs.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net operating income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less discontinued operations, interest, other income and income from preferred equity investments and investments securities, plus corporate general and administrative expense, acquisition and transaction-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P71_S1	NOI is adjusted to include our pro-rata share of NOI from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P71_S2	We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P71_S3	Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P71_S4	Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P72_S2	In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P73_S2	NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	Cash NOI is NOI presented on a cash basis, which is NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-lining of rent and the amortization of above and below market leases.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Adjusted Cash NOI is Cash NOI after eliminating the effects of free rent.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	The tables below reflect the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	_________________ (1) Proportionate share of adjustments related to unconsolidated joint venture and amortization of difference in basis.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Dividends We are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	On September 22, 2010, our board of directors approved, and we declared, a dividend rate equal to $0.605 per share, a 6.05% annualized rate based on the common share price of $10.00 commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	The dividend was paid to stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00165753424 per day.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	In April 2014, our board of directors changed the annualized rate to $0.46 per share per annum, beginning with the April 2014 dividend.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Beginning in April 2014, payments are made to stockholders of record at the close of business on the 8th day of each month, and payable on the 15th day of such month.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	Payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P78_S2	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of dividends or distributions paid or suspend dividend payments at any time and therefore dividend payments are not assured.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P78_S3	Effective March 31, 2014, the board of directors approved the suspension of the DRIP.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , dividends paid totaled $86.0 million , including $19.0 million of dividends that were reinvested through the DRIP and $0.9 million of dividends paid on unvested restricted shares and distributions paid on participating LTIP units and OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , cash used to pay our dividends was primarily generated from cash flows provided by operations, proceeds from common stock issued under the DRIP, issuances of common stock from prior periods, proceeds from financings and proceeds from Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	The following table shows the sources for the payment of dividends for the periods presented:
1474464_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	__________________ (1) Includes payments related to unvested restricted stock, participating LTIP units, Class B units and OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	(2) Cash flows provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 include cash-related acquisition and transaction related expenses of $16.1 million .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	The following table compares cumulative amounts paid to our stockholders, irrespective of their treatment as dividends or distributions for tax purposes, to cumulative net loss (in accordance with GAAP) for the period from October 6, 2009 (date of inception) through December 31, 2014 :
1474464_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	__________________________________ (1) Includes amounts paid related to unvested restricted shares, participating LTIP units, Class B units and OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	(2) Net loss as defined by GAAP includes the non-cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense, valuations of derivatives as well as acquisition and transaction related costs.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	Dilution Our net tangible book value per share is a mechanical calculation using amounts from our balance sheet, and is calculated by (1) total book value of our assets less the net value of intangible assets, (2) minus total liabilities less the net value of intangible liabilities, (3) divided by the total number of common and preferred stock outstanding.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	It assumes that the value of real estate, and real estate related assets and liabilities diminish predictably over time as shown through the depreciation and amortization of real estate investments.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Real estate values have historically risen and fallen with market conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	Net tangible book value is used generally as a conservative measure of net worth and we do not believe it reflects our estimated value per share.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	It is not intended to reflect the value of our assets upon an orderly liquidation in accordance with our investment objectives.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	Our net tangible book value reflects dilution in the value of our fully diluted common and preferred stock from the issue price as a result of (i) operating losses, which reflect accumulated depreciation and amortization of real estate investments, (ii) the funding of dividends from sources other than cash flows from operations, and (iii) fees paid in connection with our IPO, including commissions, dealer manager fees and other offering costs.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P84_S4	As of December 31, 2014 our tangible book value per share was $6.92 .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Loan Obligations As of December 31, 2014 , we had consolidated mortgage notes payable of $172.2 million , excluding our 48.9% pro rata share of unconsolidated mortgage debt relating to Worldwide Plaza of $427.9 million .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P85_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the consolidated mortgage notes payable had a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and our pro-rata share of unconsolidated mortgage debt relating to Worldwide Plaza had a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% .
1474464_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	The payment terms of our loan obligations require principal and interest amounts payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P86_S1	Our loan agreements requires us to comply with specific reporting covenants.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P86_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss because defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P87_S1	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default and cause us to recognize taxable income on foreclosure for federal income tax purposes even though we do not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P87_S2	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of dividends required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P87_S3	Our mortgage loan securing the three buildings in our Bleecker Street portfolio in the amount of $21.3 million will mature in December 2015.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P87_S4	The Company intends to refinance this obligation utilizing a mortgage loan or unused proceeds from our credit facility.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P87_S5	See Note 7 - Credit Facility of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P87_S6	The following is a summary of our contractual debt obligations as of December 31, 2014 :
1474464_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	Lease Obligations We entered into lease agreements primarily related to certain acquisitions under leasehold interest arrangements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	The following table reflects the minimum base rental cash payments due from us over the next five years and thereafter under these arrangements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes among other items.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Election as a REIT We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent we distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	REITs are subject to a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	In order to maintain our status as a REIT, we must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S3	We believe we are organized and operated in such a manner as to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S4	Inflation Some of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S5	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S6	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S7	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P90_S8	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Related-Party Transactions and Agreements We have entered into agreements with affiliates of our Sponsor, whereby we have paid or may in the future pay certain fees or reimbursements to our Advisor, its affiliates and entities under common ownership with our Advisor in connection with acquisition and financing activities, sales and maintenance of common stock under our offering, transfer agency services, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	See Note 14 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our financial statements included in this report for a discussion of the various related party transactions, agreements and fees.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P92_S0	We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P93_S0	On February 4, 2015, Cache, Inc. ("Cache"), one of our tenants at 256 W. 38th Street, sought bankruptcy protection from its creditors, including us.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P93_S1	Cache has ceased making rental payments and has announced its intention to vacate its spaces in May 2015.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P93_S2	We believe that Cache's bankruptcy is an opportunity to re-lease the currently below-market space at market rates later in 2015.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P93_S3	The termination of Cache's lease is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P93_S4	On March 27, 2015, the owner of 123 William Street, the property in which we held our $35.1 million preferred equity investment, sold the property to American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc., which is sponsored and advised by entities under common control with our Sponsor and our Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P93_S5	On such date, we received our entire principal balance plus accrued income receivable.
1474464_15_ITEM7_P93_S6	Cash received from the sale of our preferred equity investment has increased our liquidity and the funds are available for dividends to our stockholders and other working capital requirements.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate debt.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We had fixed-rate secured mortgage notes payable and fixed-rate loans under our credit facility, with an aggregate carrying value of $252.2 million and a fair value of $254.5 million .
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the notes, but it has no impact on interest due on the notes.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2014 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S5	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $3.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S6	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $2.9 million .
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2014 , our variable-rate portion of the credit facility had a carrying and fair value of $555.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P0_S8	Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate credit facility affects interest expense incurred and cash flow.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2014 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate credit facility would increase or decrease our interest expense by $5.6 million annually.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2014 , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	As required by Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in subparagraph (e) of that rule.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Management is required to evaluate, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	As described below, management has identified material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting and management, including each of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2014 due to these material weaknesses.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Management believes the consolidated financial statements contained herein present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position as of the specified dates and our results of operations and cash flows for the specified periods.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and as set forth below.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Under Rule 13a-15(c), management must evaluate, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness, as of the end of each calendar year, of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	The term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer; 2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and 3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	In the course of preparing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements included herein, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014 due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	As part of our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as described above, management concluded that the Company did not:
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Maintain an effective control environment and risk assessment process, specifically:
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Design and conduct an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze risks impacting financial reporting, and implement business process level controls and monitoring activities that are responsive to those risks.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Design and maintain appropriate controls over the authorization, completeness, existence and accuracy of manual journal entries.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	These deficiencies in internal controls did not result in any misstatements in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the current period, however, the ineffectiveness of the design, implementation, and operation of the controls create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Accordingly, our management concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P7_S3	KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, was engaged to audit the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and their audit report is included on Page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. KPMG LLP was also engaged to audit the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and issued an adverse audit report regarding their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which is included on page F-4 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P7_S4	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Remediation Plan Management, and our Board of Directors, is focused on improving the Company s processes and internal controls.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Management, with the concurrence of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company has directed management to proceed with a remediation plan.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P8_S2	Accordingly, management is in the process of developing and implementing a plan to remediate the deficiencies in internal control referenced above.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	Management will continue to evaluate and revise its business process review to ensure that information systems, processes, internal controls, monitoring activities and personnel are fully aligned with our financial reporting objectives.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P10_S0	Management has begun to establish appropriate and more restrictive access controls with respect to the general ledger IT application and supporting systems and to establish appropriate segregation of duties within the accounts payable and cash disbursements process.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P10_S1	Additional staffing will be added to manage system administration.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P11_S0	Excel tools and sub-ledgers will be removed from the enterprise-wide shared drives, and appropriate computing and access controls will be implemented.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P12_S0	Management will improve the documentation of the Company s system of internal control over financial reporting, specifically its control environment, business processes and control activities responsive to the risks of misstatement, operating policies and procedures, and monitoring activities.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P13_S0	Management will design and maintain appropriate controls over the authorization, completeness, existence and accuracy of manual journal entries.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P13_S1	We intend to execute our remediation plan as soon as feasible.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P13_S2	We will test the ongoing effectiveness of the new controls and will consider the material weakness remediated after the new controls operate effectively for a sufficient period of time.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P13_S3	There is no assurance, however, that these measures will remediate the material weakness or ensure that our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in the future.
1474464_15_ITEM9A_P13_S4	If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, we may not timely file our periodic reports with the SEC which will have a material adverse effect on our ability to access the capital markets and affect our ability to provide accurate financial information.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P12_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P12_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P12_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P12_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P13_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P13_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P14_S1	The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management s assessment.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	Maintain an effective control environment and risk assessment process, specifically:
1474464_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	Design and maintain appropriate controls over the authorization, completeness, existence and accuracy of manual journal entries.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P16_S2	These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2014 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated May 11, 2015 , which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	In our opinion, because of the effect of the aforementioned material weaknesses on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, New York REIT Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P17_S1	We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management s statements referring to corrective actions taken after December 31, 2014 , relative to the aforementioned material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").
1474464_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated joint venture arrangements in which the Company has controlling financial interests, either through voting or similar rights or by means other than voting rights if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity ("VIE").
1474464_15_ITEM15_P22_S1	The portions of the consolidated joint venture arrangements not owned by the Company are presented as noncontrolling interests.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P22_S2	All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	The Company evaluates its relationships and investments to determine if it has variable interests in a VIE.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	A variable interest is an investment or other interest that will absorb portions of an entity s expected losses or receive portions of the entity s expected residual returns.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P24_S1	If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in an entity, it evaluates whether such entity is a VIE.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (1) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company consolidates any VIEs when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE s operations.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	A variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	The Company continually evaluates the need to consolidate its joint ventures.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P27_S1	In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, power to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners or members as well as whether the entity is a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P28_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P28_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	Management makes significant estimates regarding revenue recognition, purchase price allocations to record investments in real estate, derivative financial instruments and hedging activities and fair value measurements, as applicable.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Investments in Real Estate The Company evaluates the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S0	In business combinations, the Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective estimated fair values.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S1	Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S2	Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S3	The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S4	The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S5	The fair value of above-market or below-market leases and ground leases is recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the Company's estimate of the comparable fair market lease rate, measured over the remaining term of the lease, including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S6	The fair value of other intangible assets, such as real estate tax abatements, are recorded based on the present value of the expected benefit and amortized over the expected useful life.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S7	Fair values of assumed mortgages, if applicable, are recorded as debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above- or below-market interest rates.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S8	Non-controlling interests in property owning entities are recorded based on its fair value at the date of acquisition, as determined by the terms of the applicable agreement.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S9	The Company utilizes a number of sources in making its estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P31_S10	The Company also considers information and other factors including: market conditions, the industry in which the tenant operates, characteristics of the real estate such as location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P32_S0	The Company presents the operations related to properties that have been, or are intended to be, sold as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for all periods presented where the disposal of a component represents a strategic shift that has had or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P32_S1	Properties that are intended to be sold will be designated as "held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P32_S2	Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P32_S3	The Company did not have any properties held for sale as of December 31, 2014 or 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Intangible assets and acquired lease liabilities consist of the following as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P34_S0	Depreciation and Amortization The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the components of the Company s real estate investments for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P34_S1	These assessments have a direct impact on the Company s net income because if the Company were to shorten the expected useful lives of the Company s real estate investments, the Company would depreciate these investments over fewer years, resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P35_S0	Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P36_S0	Acquired above-market leases are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P36_S1	Acquired below-market leases are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P36_S2	Acquired above-market ground leases are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P36_S3	Acquired below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option period.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P36_S4	The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P36_S5	Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	The following table provides the weighted-average remaining amortization and accretion periods as of December 31, 2014 , for intangible assets and liabilities and the projected amortization expense and adjustments to revenues for the next five years:
1474464_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , amortization of in-place leases and other intangibles of $21.5 million , $8.3 million and $1.7 million , respectively, is included in depreciation and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , net amortization of above- and below-market lease intangibles of $9.3 million , $2.6 million and $0.4 million , respectively, is included in rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , amortization of above-market ground lease liability of $0.4 million and $0.1 million , respectively, is included in property operating expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P38_S3	There was no amortization related to the above-market ground lease for the year ended December 31, 2012 as the related property was acquired in 2013.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P39_S3	If such estimated cash flows are less than the the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P39_S4	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is based on the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P39_S5	These assessments result in the immediate recognition of an impairment loss, resulting in a reduction of net income.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P39_S6	The Company did not recognize any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Impairment of Equity Method Investments The Company monitors the value of its equity method investments for indicators of impairment.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P40_S1	An impairment charge is recognized when the Company determines that a decline in the fair value of the investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P40_S2	The assessment of impairment is subjective and involves the application of significant assumptions and judgments about the Company's intent and ability to recover its investment given the nature and operations of the underlying investment.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in bank accounts as well as investments in highly-liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , $0.3 million was held in money market funds with the Company's financial institutions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company deposits cash with high-quality financial institutions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P42_S1	These deposits are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the "FDIC") up to an insurance limit.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P42_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had deposits of $22.5 million and $233.4 million , respectively, of which $18.9 million and $228.8 million , respectively, were in excess of the amount insured by the FDIC.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P42_S3	Although the Company bears risk to amounts in excess of those insured by the FDIC, it does not anticipate any losses as a result.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily consists of funds held in escrow related to real estate acquisitions and reserves related to lease expirations as well as maintenance, real estate, structural, and debt service reserves.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	Investment Securities The Company classifies its investments in debt or equity securities into one of three classes: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, as applicable.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P44_S1	Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at amortized cost.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P44_S2	Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purposes of selling them in the near future are classified as trading securities.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P44_S3	Debt and equity securities not classified as trading securities or as held-to-maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a component of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company evaluates its investments in securities for impairment or other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	The Company reviews each investment individually and assesses factors that may include (i) if the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its fair value, (ii) if there has been any change in the market as a whole or in the investee s market, (iii) if there are any plans to sell the investment in question or if the Company believes it may be forced to sell its investment, and (iv) if there have been any other factors that would indicate the possibility of the existence of an other-than-temporary impairment.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	The fair value of the Company s investments in available-for-sale securities generally rise and fall based on current market conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	If, after reviewing relevant factors surrounding an impaired security, the Company determines that it will not recover its full investment in an impaired security, the Company recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period in which the other-than-temporary impairment is discovered, regardless of whether or not the Company plans to sell or believes it will be forced to sell the security in question.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Venture The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting in cases where the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control, the entities and is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	These investments are recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P48_S2	Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments and the underlying equity in net assets is depreciated and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	Equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures is allocated based on the Company's ownership or economic interest in each joint venture.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	A loss in the value of a joint venture investment that is determined to be other than temporary is recognized in the period in which the loss occurs.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S2	See Note 4 - Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S3	Listing Note Distribution Concurrently with the Listing, the Company caused the OP to issue the Listing Note (see Note 9 - Subordinated Listing Distribution).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S4	The Listing Note value was determined, in part, based on the average market value of the Company's outstanding common stock for the period from 180 days to 210 days after the Listing.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S5	Until the principal amount of the Listing Note was determined, the Listing Note was treated as a derivative and the Company estimated the contingent consideration using a valuation model and recorded the fair value of the Listing Note on the consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S6	The initial fair value and subsequent changes in fair value were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S7	The final principal value of the Listing Note was determined in November 2014 and converted into OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P49_S8	See Note 9 - Subordinated Listing Distribution.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement On April 15, 2014 (the "Effective Date"), in connection with the Listing, the Company entered into the 2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement (the "OPP") with the OP and the Advisor.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	See Note 16 - Share-Based Compensation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P50_S2	The Company recognized the excess cost of the tendered shares over its par value as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	Deferred Costs, Net Deferred costs, net consists of deferred financing costs and leasing costs.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P51_S1	Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P51_S2	These costs are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P51_S3	Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P51_S4	Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P51_S5	Deferred leasing costs, consisting primarily of lease commissions and professional fees incurred, are deferred and amortized over the term of the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P52_S0	Share Repurchase Program The Company's board of directors had adopted a Share Repurchase Program ("SRP") that enabled stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in limited circumstances.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P52_S1	The SRP permitted investors to sell their shares back to the Company after they had held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described below.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P52_S2	Prior to the Listing, the purchase price per share was dependent on the length of time investors had held such shares as follows: after one year from the purchase date the lower of $9.25 or 92.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after two years from the purchase date the lower of $9.50 or 95.0% of the amount they actually paid for each share; after three years from the purchase date the lower of $9.75 or 97.5% of the amount they actually paid for each share; and after four years from the purchase date the lower of $10.00 or 100% of the amount they actually paid for each share (in each case, as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits and recapitalizations).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Company was only authorized to repurchase shares pursuant to the SRP up to the value of the shares issued under the Distribution Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP") and limited the amount spent to repurchase shares in a given quarter to the value of the shares issued under the DRIP in that same quarter.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P53_S1	In addition, the board of directors reserved the right to reject a request for redemption, at any time.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P53_S2	Due to these limitations, the Company did not guarantee that it would be able to accommodate all repurchase requests.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Purchases under the SRP by the Company were limited in any calendar year to 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the prior year (or 1.25% per calendar quarter).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	When a stockholder requested repurchases and the repurchases were approved by the Company's board of directors, it reclassified such obligation from equity to a liability based on the settlement value of the obligation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P54_S2	On March 31, 2014, the Company's board of directors approved the termination of the Company s SRP.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P54_S3	See Note 12 - Common Stock.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	Distribution Reinvestment Plan Pursuant to the DRIP, stockholders were able to elect to reinvest dividends by purchasing shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	No dealer manager fees or selling commissions were paid with respect to shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P55_S2	Shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP have the same rights and were treated in the same manner as if such shares were issued pursuant to the IPO.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P56_S0	The board of directors reserved the right to designate that certain cash or other dividends be excluded from the DRIP.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company had the right to amend any aspect of the DRIP or terminate the DRIP with ten days' notice to participants.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P56_S2	On March 31, 2014, the Company provided notices to its stockholders that, pursuant to the terms of the DRIP, the Company's board of directors approved an amendment to suspend the DRIP, effective March 31, 2014.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P56_S3	The final issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP in connection with the Company's March 2014 dividend was paid in April 2014.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P56_S4	Shares issued under the DRIP were recorded to equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the period dividends were declared.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P57_S0	Derivative Instruments The Company may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P57_S1	Certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P59_S2	Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P61_S1	The accounting for subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives depends on whether each has been designed and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P61_S2	If the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting treatment, any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments is recognized immediately in gains (losses) on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P61_S3	If the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that it is effective.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P61_S4	Any ineffective portion of a derivative's change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company's revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P62_S1	Since many of the Company's leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, GAAP requires the Company to record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that the Company will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P62_S2	The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P62_S3	When the Company acquires a property, the terms of existing leases are considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	For the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P64_S0	To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, we evaluate whether the Company owns or the tenant owns the tenant improvements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P64_S1	When the Company is the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is when such improvements are substantially complete.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P64_S2	When the Company concludes that the Company is not the owner (as the tenant is the owner) of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P64_S3	When the Company concludes that the Company is the owner of tenant improvements, the Company records the cost to construct the tenant improvements, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants, as a capital asset.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P64_S4	When the Company concludes that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, the Company records its contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred leasing costs, net on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P65_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an allowance for uncollectible accounts or directly write-off of the receivable in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company's leases generally provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance expenses and other other operating expenses to the extent that a tenant's pro rata share of the expenses exceeds a base year level set in the lease or to the extent that the tenant has a lease on a triple net basis.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P66_S1	Such cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P67_S0	The Company s hotel revenues are recognized as earned and are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Company owns certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain thresholds or other targets, which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P68_S1	The Company defers the recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P68_S2	Contingent rental income will be included in rental income on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P68_S3	The Company did not recognize any revenue or deferred revenue related to contingent rental income during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 or 2012 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P69_S0	The Company has a stock-based incentive award plan for its directors, which is accounted for under the guidance for employee share based payments.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	The cost of services received in exchange for a stock award is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and the expense for such awards is included in general and administrative expenses and is recognized over the vesting period or when the requirements for exercise of the award have been met.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	Income Taxes The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P70_S1	If the Company continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes all its REIT taxable income to its stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that the Company distribute annually at least 90% of the Company s REIT taxable income to the Company s stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P71_S1	If the Company fails to continue to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) beginning with the year in which it fails to qualify and may be precluded from being able to elect to be treated as a REIT for the Company s four subsequent taxable years.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company distributed to its shareholders 100% of its ordinary taxable income for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes related to such ordinary taxable income was recorded on the Company s financial statements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P72_S2	Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company purchased a hotel, which is owned by a subsidiary of the OP and leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), that is owned by the OP.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P73_S1	A TRS is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	The TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P74_S2	In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P74_S3	In the event the Company determines that it would not be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, the Company establishes a valuation allowance which offsets the previously recognized income tax benefit.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the TRSs for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S1	The Company had deferred tax assets and a corresponding valuation allowance of $1.7 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S2	The TRS had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards as of December 31, 2014 of $3.7 million , which will expire through 2035.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S3	The Company estimates income tax relating to its TRS using a combined federal and state rate of approximately 42% for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S4	The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carry forwards will not be utilized during the carry forward period and as such the Company has established a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S5	The Company had immaterial current and deferred federal and state income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had no material uncertain income tax positions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P75_S7	The tax years subsequent to and including the year ended December 31, 2011 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	The Company calculates basic income (loss) per share of common stock by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average shares of its common stock outstanding for a respective period.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments such as unvested restricted stock, Long-term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") units and OP units, based on the average share price for the period in determining the number of incremental shares that are to be added to the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P76_S2	See Note 18 - Net Loss Per Share.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	Reportable Segments The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The Company's investments in real estate generate rental revenue and other income through the leasing and management of properties.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P78_S1	Management evaluates the operating performance of the Company's investments in real estate at the individual property level.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended the requirements for reporting discontinued operations.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	Under the revised guidance, in addition to other disclosure requirements, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results when the component or group of components meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, disposed of by sale or other than by sale.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	The Company has adopted the provisions of this guidance effective January 1, 2014, and has applied the provisions prospectively.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P79_S3	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P95_S0	At acquisition, the Company's investment in Worldwide Plaza exceeded the Company's share of the book value of the net assets of Worldwide Plaza by $260.6 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P95_S1	This basis difference resulted from the excess of the Company's purchase price for its equity interest in Worldwide Plaza over the book value of Worldwide Plaza's net assets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P95_S2	Substantially all of this basis difference was allocated to the fair values of Worldwide Plaza's assets and liabilities.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company amortizes the basis difference over the anticipated useful lives of the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P100_S0	Note 6 Investment Securities The Company's investment securities are comprised of investments in redeemable preferred stock and equity securities with an aggregate fair value of $4.7 million and $1.0 million , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P100_S1	The equity securities consist of a real estate income fund that is managed by an affiliate of the Sponsor (see Note 14 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements ).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P100_S2	The Company's preferred stock investments are redeemable at the respective issuer's option after five years from issuance.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P101_S0	The following table details the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1474464_15_ITEM15_P102_S0	The following table presents the fair value and gross unrealized losses of investments aggregated by investment type, the length of time and the number of securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of the periods indicated:
1474464_15_ITEM15_P103_S0	Redeemable preferred stock in a continuous unrealized loss position do not reflect any deterioration of the credit worthiness of the issuing entities.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P103_S1	The unrealized losses on these temporarily impaired securities are primarily the result of changes in current market conditions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P103_S2	Because we do not currently intend to sell our redeemable preferred stock, and because it is not more-likely-than-not that we would be required to sell the securities prior to recovery, the impairment is considered to be temporary.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S0	Note 7 Credit Facility On March 30, 2012, the Company entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with Capital One, National Association ("Capital One") in the amount of $40.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S1	On August 20, 2013, the Company entered into a $220.0 million credit facility with Capital One, which provided for aggregate revolving loan borrowings of up to $ 110.0 million and aggregate term loan borrowings of up to $110.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S2	The credit facility contained an "accordion" feature to allow the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the aggregate commitments under the credit facility to a maximum of $325.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S3	On December 23, 2013, the Company amended the credit facility to decrease the aggregate revolving loan borrowings to $50.0 million and increase the aggregate term loan borrowings to $340.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S4	On April 14, 2014, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit facility with Capital One ("Amended Facility").
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S5	The Amended Facility allows for total borrowings of up to $705.0 million with a $305.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving loan.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S6	The term loan component of the Amended Facility matures in August 2018 and the revolving loan component matures in August 2016.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S7	The Amended Facility contains an "accordion feature" to allow the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the aggregate loan borrowings to up to $1.0 billion of total borrowings.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P104_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , the Company expensed $3.6 million of previously deferred financing costs in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) as a result of the credit facility amendments.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company has the option, based upon its corporate leverage, to have the Amended Facility priced at either: (a) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.50% to 2.25% ; or (b) the Base Rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.50% to 1.25% .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S1	Base Rate is defined in the Amended Facility as the greater of (i) the fluctuating annual rate of interest announced from time to time by the lender as its prime rate, (ii) 0.50% above the federal funds effective rate and (iii) 1.00% above the applicable one-month LIBOR.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S2	The outstanding balance of the term and revolving portions of the Amended Facility as of December 31, 2014 was $305.0 million and $330.0 million , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S3	The balance of the term portion of the facility at December 31, 2013 was $305.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S4	There were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving portion of the facility at December 31, 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S5	The facility had a combined weighted average interest rate of 2.08% and 2.19% as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , respectively, a portion of which is fixed with an interest rate swap.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S6	The Amended Facility includes an unused commitment fee per annum of (a) 0.15% if the unused balance of the facility is equal to or less than 50% of the available facility and (b) 0.25% if the unused balance of the facility exceeds 50% of the available facility.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S7	The unused borrowing capacity, based on the borrowing base properties as of December 31, 2014 , was $6.0 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S8	Availability of borrowings is based on a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S9	The Amended Facility provides for monthly interest payments for each Base Rate loan and periodic payments for each LIBOR loan, based upon the applicable LIBOR loan period, with all principal outstanding being due on the maturity date.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S10	The Amended Facility may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S11	In the event of a default, the lenders have the right to terminate their obligations under the Amended Facility and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P105_S12	The Amended Facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P106_S0	The Company's mortgage notes payable as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 consist of the following:
1474464_15_ITEM15_P107_S0	______________________ (1) Fixed through an interest rate swap agreement.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P107_S1	(2) Calculated on a weighted average basis for all mortgages outstanding as of December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P108_S0	Real estate investments of $317.0 million , at cost, at December 31, 2014 have been pledged as collateral to their respective mortgages and are not available to satisfy our corporate debts and obligations unless first satisfying the mortgage note payable on the properties.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P108_S1	The following table summarizes the scheduled aggregate principal repayments subsequent to December 31, 2014 :
1474464_15_ITEM15_P109_S0	Some of the Company's mortgage note agreements require compliance with certain property-level financial covenants including debt service coverage ratios.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P109_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its mortgage note agreements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P110_S0	Note 9 Subordinated Listing Distribution Upon occurrence of the Listing, the New York Recovery Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the "SLP"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Sponsor, became entitled to begin receiving distributions of net sale proceeds pursuant to its special limited partner interest in the OP (the "SLP Interest") in an aggregate amount that was evidenced by the issuance of a note by the OP (the "Listing Note").
1474464_15_ITEM15_P110_S1	The Listing Note was equal to 15.0% of the amount, if any, by which (a) the average market value of the Company s outstanding common stock for the period 180 days to 210 days after Listing, plus distributions paid by the Company prior to Listing, exceeded (b) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from stockholders during the Company s prior offering and the amount of cash flow necessary to generate a 6.0% annual cumulative, non-compounded return to such stockholders.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P110_S2	Concurrently with the Listing, the Company, as general partner of the OP, caused the OP to enter into the Listing Note Agreement dated April 15, 2014 by and between the OP and the SLP, and caused the OP to issue the Listing Note.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P110_S3	The Listing Note was evidence of the SLP's right to receive distributions of net sales proceeds from the sale of the Company's real estate and real estate-related assets up to an aggregate amount equal to the principal balance of the Listing Note.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P110_S4	Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the SLP had the right, but not the obligation, to convert all or a portion of the SLP interest into OP units which are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P111_S0	The Listing Note principal amount of $33.5 million was determined based on an economic hurdle, returns to shareholders above such hurdle and the actual average market value of the Company s outstanding common stock for the period 180 days to 210 days after the Listing and was recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P112_S0	Note 10 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the instrument.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P112_S1	This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the instruments, as applicable, including the period to maturity, and may use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities, and unobservable inputs, such as expected volatility.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P113_S0	The guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P113_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P113_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S0	The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S1	In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S2	The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S3	However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S4	Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swaps fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those interest rate swaps utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S5	However, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its interest rate swap positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's interest rate swaps.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S6	As a result, the Company has determined that its interest rate swap valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P114_S7	See Note 11 - Interest Rate Derivatives and Hedging Activities.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P115_S0	The valuation of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P115_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the interest rate swaps, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P115_S2	In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company's potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the counterparties.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P116_S0	The Company has investments in redeemable preferred stock and equity securities that are traded in active markets and therefore, due to the availability of quoted market prices in active markets, the Company classified these investments as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P116_S1	The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall:
1474464_15_ITEM15_P117_S0	A review of the fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P118_S0	Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P118_S1	There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P119_S0	Financial instruments not carried at fair value The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P119_S1	The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, prepaid expenses and other assets, due from affiliates, notes payable, accounts payable and dividends payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheet due to their short-term nature.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P119_S2	The fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet are reported below.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P120_S0	The fair value of mortgage notes payable, the fixed-rate portions of term loans on the credit facility, and the preferred equity investment are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on similar types of arrangements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P120_S1	Advances under the credit facility with variable interest rates and advances under the revolving portion of the credit facility are considered to be reported at fair value.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P121_S0	Note 11 Interest Rate Derivatives and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company may use derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, collars, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P121_S1	The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P121_S2	The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative or purposes other than interest rate risk management.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P121_S3	The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements will not be able to perform under the agreements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P121_S4	To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties with high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P122_S0	Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P122_S1	To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P123_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P123_S1	Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract and payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the floor strike rate on the contract.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P123_S2	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P123_S3	The Company uses such derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P123_S4	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company's variable-rate debt.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P123_S5	During the next 12 months , the Company estimates that an additional $1.8 million will be reclassified from other comprehensive income as an increase to interest expense.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P124_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P125_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the Company's derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1474464_15_ITEM15_P126_S0	Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships The table below details the location in the financial statements of the income or loss recognized on interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 :
1474464_15_ITEM15_P127_S0	The table below presents a gross presentation, the effects of offsetting, and a net presentation of the Company's derivatives as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P128_S0	The net amounts of derivative assets or liabilities can be reconciled to the tabular disclosure of fair value.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P129_S0	The tabular disclosure of fair value provides the location that derivative assets and liabilities are presented on the accompanying balance sheets.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P130_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P130_S1	These derivatives are used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements to be classified as hedging instruments.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P130_S2	The Company does not have any hedging instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P131_S0	Credit-risk-related Contingent Features The Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the Company either defaults or is capable of being declared in default on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P131_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements was $1.4 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P131_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company has not posted any collateral related to its agreements and was not in breach of any agreement provisions.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P131_S3	If the Company had breached any of these provisions, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the aggregate termination value of $1.4 million at December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P132_S0	Note 12 Common Stock As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had 162.2 million and 174.1 million shares of common stock outstanding, respectively, including unvested restricted stock, converted preferred shares and shares issued under the distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP").
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S0	On April 15, 2014, the Company commenced the Tender Offer.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S1	The Tender Offer was completed on May 12, 2014 with the Company purchasing 14.2 million shares of its common stock at a price of $10.75 per share, for an aggregate of $152.3 million , excluding fees and expenses relating to the Tender Offer and including fractional shares repurchased thereafter.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S2	The Company funded the Tender Offer using cash on hand.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S3	In September 2010, the Company's board of directors authorized, and the Company declared, dividends at a dividend rate equal to $0.605 per annum per share of common stock, commencing December 1, 2010.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S4	The dividends were paid by the fifth day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month at a per share rate of 0.0016575342 per day.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S5	In April 2014, the Company's board of directors authorized, and the Company declared, dividends at an annualized rate equal to $0.46 per share per annum beginning with the April 2014 dividend.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S6	Beginning in April 2014, dividends are paid to stockholders of record on the close of business on the 8th day of each month, payable on the 15th day of such month.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S7	The Company's board of directors may reduce the amount of dividends paid or suspend dividend payments at any time and therefore dividend payments are not assured.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P133_S8	For purposes of the presentation of information herein, the Company may refer to distributions by the operating partnership on OP units, Class B units and LTIP units as dividends.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P134_S0	On March 31, 2014, the Company's board of directors approved the termination of the Company's SRP.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P134_S1	The Company processed all of the requests received under the SRP in the first quarter of 2014 and will not process further requests.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P135_S0	The following table reflects the number of shares of common stock repurchased through the termination of the SRP:
1474464_15_ITEM15_P136_S0	Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies Future Minimum Lease Payments The Company entered into operating and capital lease agreements primarily related to certain acquisitions under leasehold interest arrangements.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P136_S1	The following table reflects the minimum base cash payments due from the Company over the next five years and thereafter under these arrangements, including the present value of the net minimum payment due under capital leases.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P136_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes among other items.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P137_S0	Total rental expense related to operating leases was $7.7 million and $0.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P137_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , interest expense related to capital leases was $0.1 million .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P137_S2	There were no such expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P138_S0	The following table discloses assets recorded under capital leases and the accumulated amortization thereon as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P139_S0	Litigation and Regulatory Matters In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to litigation, claims and regulatory matters.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P139_S1	There are no material legal or regulatory proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against the Company: The Company received a favorable ruling in a suit initiated against the Company by RXR Realty ( RXR ).
1474464_15_ITEM15_P139_S2	RXR alleged that it suffered lost profits in connection with the Company s purchase of Worldwide Plaza in October 2013.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P139_S3	On August 12, 2014, the Supreme Court of the State of New York dismissed all of RXR s claims against the seller of Worldwide Plaza and dismissed RXR s disgorgement claims against the Company, permitting only a limited, immaterial claim against the Company for RXR s cost of producing due diligence-related material to proceed.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P139_S4	RXR is currently appealing the ruling.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P139_S5	The Company has not recognized a liability with respect to RXR's claim because the Company does not believe that it is probable that it will incur a related material loss.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P140_S0	In connection with the ownership and operation of real estate, the Company may potentially be liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P172_S0	The Peer Group is comprised of the companies in the SNL US REIT Office Index.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S0	The potential outperformance award is calculated at the end of each One-Year Period, the Two-Year Period and the Three-Year Period.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S1	The award earned for the Three-Year Period is based on the formula in the table above less any awards earned for the Two-Year Period and One-Year Periods, but not less than zero; the award earned for the Two-Year Period is based on the formula in the table above less any award earned for the first and second One-Year Period, but not less than zero.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S2	Any LTIP Units that are unearned at the end of the Performance Period will be forfeited.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S4	Until such time as the LTIP Units are fully vested in accordance with the provisions of the OPP, the holders of LTIP Units are entitled to distributions equal to 10% of the distributions made on OP units.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S5	The Company paid $0.3 million in distributions related to LTIP Units during the year ended December 31, 2014 , which is included in non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S7	At the time the Advisor s capital account with respect to the LTIP Units is economically equivalent to the average capital account balance of the OP units and has been earned and has been vested for 30 days, the applicable LTIP Units will automatically convert into OP units on a one-to-one basis.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S8	The OPP provides for early calculation of LTIP Units earned and for the accelerated vesting of any earned LTIP Units in the event Advisor is terminated or in the event the Company incurs a change in control, in either case prior to the end of the Three-Year Period.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S9	The Company records equity based compensation expense associated with the awards over the requisite service period of five years.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S10	Equity-based compensation expense is adjusted each reporting period for changes in the estimated market-related performance.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P173_S11	Compensation expense related to the OPP was $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_15_ITEM15_P174_S0	The valuation of the OPP is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P174_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the OPP, including the performance periods and total return hurdles, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, and unobservable inputs, such as expected volatility.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P174_S2	As a result, the Company has determined that its OPP valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P175_S0	The following table presents information about the Company's OPP, which is measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the instrument falls:
1474464_15_ITEM15_P176_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for the changes in instruments with Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy for the year ended December 31, 2014 :
1474464_15_ITEM15_P177_S0	The following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P177_S1	For the relationship described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P178_S0	Expected volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P178_S1	Generally, the higher the expected volatility of the underlying instrument, the wider the range of potential future returns.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P178_S2	An increase in expected volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in the fair value measurement of an instrument.
1474464_15_ITEM15_P179_S0	Other Share-Based Compensation The Company may issue common stock in lieu of cash to pay fees earned by the Company's directors at the respective director's election.

1474464_15_ITEM15_P209_S9	(c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 10(b) of this Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this Section 12, absent a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee s statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification.

1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a New York City focused REIT that seeks to provide stockholders with an opportunity to participate in one of the world's most dynamic real estate markets by primarily owning income-producing commercial real estate in New York City.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	We focus on acquiring and owning office and retail properties in Manhattan, the largest and most liquid real estate market in the United States.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	We purchased our first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S4	As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 22 properties located in New York City.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , our properties aggregated 3.4 million rentable square feet, had an occupancy of 95.2% and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.6 years .
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S6	Our portfolio primarily consisted of office and retail properties, representing 82% and 10% , respectively, of rentable square feet as of December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S7	We have acquired multifamily, industrial, hotel and other types of real properties to add diversity to our portfolio.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S8	Properties other than office and retail spaces represented 8% of rentable square feet.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P0_S9	Additionally, we have in the past acquired preferred equity positions in entities owning New York City real estate and may in the future also originate or acquire first mortgage loans or mezzanine loans secured by or related to New York City real estate.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "OP").
1474464_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our Advisor manages our affairs on a day-to-day basis.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	New York Recovery Properties, LLC (our "Property Manager") manages our properties, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, the parent of our Sponsor, as a result of which they are related parties and have received or will continue to receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to the investment and management of our assets.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Realty Capital Securities, LLC (our "Former Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of our initial public offering, which was ongoing from September 2010 to December 2013 (our "IPO") and, together with its affiliates, continued to provide us with various services through December 31, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	RCS Capital Corporation, the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager and certain of its affiliates that provided services to us, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Global, the parent of our Sponsor.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Strategic Alternatives As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2015, we announced that we have retained the Eastdil Secured division of Wells Fargo Securities as strategic advisor to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions at the entity or asset level.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our board continues to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	Initiatives to Increase Liquidity and Create Long-Term Value for our Stockholders During the second quarter of 2015, we announced several initiatives designed to increase our liquidity and create long-term value for our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	These initiatives include 1) increasing Cash NOI by leasing currently vacant space, stabilizing revenue at the Viceroy Hotel and releasing currently below-market expiring space at market rates; 2) considering joint venture partners in our top five assets to unlock excess value; 3) exploring the sale of five non-core assets in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of New York City; and 4) realizing internal growth opportunities by repositioning office and basement space to retail space at 1440 Broadway as well as converting the lobby to rentable retail space.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S4	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we signed five new leases for our pro rata share of 125,727 rentable square feet which, on a weighted-average basis, increased initial cash rents by 23% over prior escalated rents.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S5	We continue to market our vacant spaces at 256 W. 38th Street, 229 W. 36th Street, 350 Bleecker Street and 1440 Broadway.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S6	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we sold one of our five non-core assets, 163 Washington Avenue in Brooklyn, New York for $37.7 million .
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S7	We also entered into agreements of purchase and sale on our Duane Reade property in Queens, New York ("Duane Reade"), our property located at 1623 Kings Highway in Brooklyn, New York ("1623 Kings Highway") and our Foot Locker property in Brooklyn, New York ("Foot Locker").
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S8	The sales of Duane Reade and 1623 Kings Highway closed in February 2016 for contract sales prices of $12.6 million and $17.0 million , respectively, exclusive of closing costs.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S9	At closing, we repaid the mortgage notes payable securing Duane Reade and 1623 Kings Highway of $8.4 million and $7.3 million , respectively.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S10	We repaid $150.0 million in advances on the revolving portion of our unsecured credit facility (the Credit Facility ) with Capital One, National Association ("Capital One") during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM1_P3_S11	As of December 31, 2015 , the outstanding balance of the term loan and revolving components of our Credit Facility was $305.0 million and $180.0 million , respectively, with a combined weighted average interest rate of 2.4% .
1474464_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained a mortgage note payable of up to $325.0 million , secured by our property located at 1440 Broadway.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the mortgage note payable outstanding was $305.0 million , and up to $20.0 million is available in the future as additional advances, subject to customary funding conditions to pay, among other things, for certain tenant allowances, capital expenditures and leasing costs that have been approved by the lender.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Investment Objectives Our investment objectives include capital preservation, income generation and asset appreciation.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Maximize Total Returns - Maximize total returns to our stockholders through a combination of appreciation and current income.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Acquisitions and Investment Policies Investing in Real Property To date, we have acquired a portfolio of properties located in New York City that we believe provides us with a solid foundation.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	All of our properties were acquired during the 2010-2014 time period so we have no legacy assets relating back to acquisitions that suffered from the recession.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	The following table presents information about the property type and geographic diversity of the properties we owned as of December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	________________________________ (2) Excludes 15,055 square foot parking garage at 416 Washington Street, which is being operated under a management agreement with a third party.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The following table lists the tenants whose annualized cash rent represented greater than 10% of our total annualized cash rent for all portfolio properties as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively:
1474464_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	________________________ (1) Annualized cash rent reflects our 48.9% pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of any of the above tenants would have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	No other tenant represents more than 10% of our annualized cash rent for the periods presented.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Joint Ventures We may acquire or enter into joint ventures from time to time, if we determine that doing so would be the most cost-effective and efficient means of raising and investing capital.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness may be incurred in connection with acquiring investments.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	Any such financing or indebtedness will have priority over our equity interest in such property, such as secured mortgage notes payable encumbering Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Investing in Equity Securities We may make equity investments in other REITs and other real estate companies that operate assets meeting our investment objectives.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	We may purchase the common or preferred stock of these entities or options to acquire their stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We may target a public company that owns commercial real estate or real estate-related assets when we believe its stock is trading at a discount to that company s net asset value.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	We may eventually seek to acquire or gain a controlling interest in the companies that we target.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Financing Strategies / Offerings We may use debt financing to fund property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The form of our indebtedness varies in terms of duration (long or short term), secured or unsecured, or fixed or variable rate.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements, for speculative purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	We have entered into interest rate swaps and caps in the past and may continue to do so in the future in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risks on variable rate debt.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet with conservative leverage.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	We intend to stabilize our leverage at 50% or less of combined enterprise value (which we define as debt outstanding, including our portion of debt from our investment in Worldwide Plaza of $1.3 billion , plus fully diluted shares outstanding multiplied by our share price, which equaled $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 ).
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , our combined debt to enterprise value was 40.3% and our combined debt had a weighted average interest rate equal to 3.5% per annum.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S6	We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S7	We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S8	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S9	In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S10	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P15_S11	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Competition The New York City real estate market is highly competitive.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	The number of competing properties in the New York City market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	To the extent we engage in additional acquisition activities, we compete with many other entities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms and lenders.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of our Sponsor for properties or tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	Many of these competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S4	It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S5	In addition, the number of competing properties in the New York MSA could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S6	Regulations Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S7	We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S8	As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S9	Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P17_S10	However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	We hire third parties to conduct Phase I environmental reviews of the real property that we intend to purchase.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	Employees We have no direct employees.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	The employees of our Advisor and its affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including acquisitions, property management, accounting, legal, asset management, transfer agent and investor relations services.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including capital markets activities, asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities.
1474464_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	In the event that any of these companies were unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide such services ourselves or obtain such services from other sources.

1474464_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2015, we announced that we have retained the Eastdil Secured division of Wells Fargo Securities as strategic advisor to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions at the entity or asset level.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our board continues to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	There can be no assurance regarding the form or substance of any potential transaction or transactions that may be identified or consummated as a result of this process or how long the process may take.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ability to identify and consummate a potential transaction or transactions is dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends and the interest of third parties in our company as a whole or our assets individually.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	In addition, any potential transaction or transactions may be subject to conditions including, if we pursue a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a merger or business combination with a third party, stockholder approval.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	There can be no assurance we would be able to obtain the necessary approval.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Further, the process of exploring strategic alternatives is time-consuming, requires our management to divert their focus from our day-to-day business, and results in us incurring expenses outside the normal course of operations, including expenses for our financial and legal advisors.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	All of our properties are located in the New York MSA, making us dependent upon the economic climate in New York City than if our investments were geographically diversified and subjecting us to significant competitive pressure.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	All of the real estate assets we own are located in the New York MSA.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	We are subject to risks generally inherent in concentrating investments in a certain geography.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These risks resulting from a lack of diversification may become even greater in the event of a downturn in the commercial real estate industry and could significantly adversely affect the value of our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	A downturn in New York City s economy, in a submarket within New York City or in the overall national economy could, for example, result in reduced demand for office or lodging space.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Likewise, declines in the financial services or media sectors may have a disproportionate adverse effect on the New York City real estate market.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	These adverse effects could be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of New York City.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Moreover, the New York City real estate market is highly competitive.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	The number of competing properties in the New York City market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S6	To the extent we engage in additional acquisition activities, we compete with many other entities including other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms and lenders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S7	We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of our Sponsor for properties or tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S8	Many of these competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S9	Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S10	It also may result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P3_S11	In addition, the number of competing properties in the New York MSA could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Our ability to meet capital needs we may have in the future depends on our ability to raise additional capital.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders, on an annual basis, at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Thus, our ability to fund any capital needs we may have in the future from cash flows from operations will be limited.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Consequently, we may need to rely on third-party sources to fund any capital needs in the future, and to fund the exercise of our option to purchase the balance of the equity interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Failure to exercise this option will subject us to a fee equal to $25.0 million .
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	The loan securing Worldwide Plaza includes provisions which could restrict our exercise of the option unless we prepay the loan or meet certain tests, including net worth tests, in order to assume the existing loan securing Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	While we currently believe we meet such tests, there can be no assurance that we will meet them at the time that we desire to exercise the option, and the cost to prepay the loan securing Worldwide Plaza is likely to be significant.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	the market price per share of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire and achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We may be unable to renew expiring leases on terms and conditions that are as, or more, favorable as the terms and conditions of the expiring leases.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	In addition, vacancies may occur at one or more of our properties due to a default by a tenant on its lease or expiration of a lease.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Vacancies may reduce the value of a property as a result of reduced cash flow generated by the property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Tenant credit concentrations make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to those tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The financial failure of any or all of these tenants is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, the value of our properties are driven in part by the credit quality of the underlying tenants, and an adverse change in the tenants' financial conditions or a decline in the credit rating of such tenants may result in a decline in the value of our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	A bankruptcy filing by one of our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	There is no assurance the tenant or its trustee would agree to assume the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages and it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to pay dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S7	Our properties may be subject to impairment charges.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We periodically evaluate our real estate investments for impairment indicators.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S9	The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions, tenant performance and legal structure.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S10	For example, the early termination of, or default under, a lease by a major tenant may lead to an impairment charge.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S11	If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to make a downward adjustment to the net carrying value of the property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Impairment charges also indicate a potential permanent adverse change in the fundamental operating characteristics of the impaired property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P11_S13	There is no assurance that these adverse changes will be reversed in the future and the decline in the impaired property s value could be permanent.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our real estate investments are relatively illiquid and subject to some restrictions on sale, and therefore we may not be able to dispose of properties at the time of our choosing or on favorable terms.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Investments in real properties are relatively illiquid.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We may not be able to quickly alter our portfolio or generate capital by selling properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The real estate market is affected by many factors, such as general economic conditions, availability of financing, interest rates and other factors, including supply and demand, that are beyond our control.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we need or desire to sell a real estate investment or real estate investments, we cannot predict whether we will be able to do so at a price or on the terms and conditions acceptable to us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property or other real estate investment.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In some circumstances, sales of a real estate investment or real estate investments may result in losses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Further, we may be required to invest capital to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct these defects or to make these improvements.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Upon sales of properties or assets, we may become subject to contractual indemnity obligations and incur material liabilities and expenses, including tax liabilities, change of control costs, prepayment penalties, required debt repayments, transfer taxes and other transaction costs.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Moreover, applicable provisions of the Code impose restrictions on the ability of a REIT to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Thus, we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing a property at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We would need to raise additional capital to make acquisitions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	While we are not currently pursuing acquisitions of assets while we consider strategic alternatives, we have limited capital available to acquire properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	To the extent we do acquire properties, our acquisition activities may be exposed to, and their success may be adversely affected by, the following risks:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	we may acquire properties without recourse, or with only limited recourse, for liabilities, whether known or unknown, such as cleanup of environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We rely on our Advisor to acquire properties on our behalf.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Because the management personnel of our Advisor may also be engaged in the process of acquiring properties for other entities formed and managed by affiliates of our Advisor, we could suffer delays in locating suitable investments or may miss out on opportunities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If our Advisor is unable to obtain further suitable investments, we will not be able to continue to increase our asset base.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We are dependent on our Advisor to provide us with executive officers and key personnel and our operating performance may be impacted by any adverse changes in the financial health of our Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Personnel and services that we require are provided to us under contracts with our Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	We depend on our Advisor to manage our operations and acquire and manage our portfolio of real estate assets.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Our Advisor makes all decisions with respect to the management of our company, subject to the supervision of, and any guidelines established by, our board of directors.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of our executive officers, including our chief executive officer, Michael A. Happel, our interim chief financial officer, Nicholas Radesca, our chief investment officer, Patrick O'Malley, and other key personnel of our Advisor and our Property Manager.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our executive officers are also executive officers of a non-traded REIT with similar investment objectives to ours which is sponsored and advised by entities under common control with our Sponsor and our Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Competition for such skilled personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that our Advisor will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel capable of meeting the needs of our business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We cannot guarantee that all, or any particular one of these key personnel, will continue to provide services to us or our Advisor, and the loss of any of these key personnel could cause our operating results could suffer.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Further, we have not and do not intend to separately maintain key person life insurance on any of our Advisor s key personnel.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Moreover, any adverse changes in the financial health of our Advisor or our Property Manager could negatively impact their ability to supply us with the key personnel necessary for successful operations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	We also depend on these key personnel to maintain relationships with firms that have special expertise in certain services or detailed knowledge regarding real properties in the five boroughs of New York City, particularly in Manhattan.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	If we lose or are unable to obtain the services of highly skilled professionals capable of establishing or maintaining appropriate strategic relationships, our ability to acquire additional properties could be adversely affected and our results of operations could suffer.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	In addition, our Advisor depends upon the fees and other compensation that it receives from us in connection with the management of our business and sale of our properties to conduct its operations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	Any adverse changes in the financial condition of, or our relationship with, our Advisor could hinder its ability to successfully manage our operations and our portfolio of investments.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S10	Additionally, changes in ownership or management practices, the occurrence of adverse events affecting our Advisor or its affiliates or other companies advised by our Advisor and its affiliates could create adverse publicity and adversely affect us and our relationship with lenders, tenants or counterparties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S11	Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S12	These changes may impact our profitability and ability to realize growth in the value of our real estate properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P18_S13	Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage could reduce our cash flows and the return on our stockholders investments.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our general liability coverage, property insurance coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties may not be adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Similarly, we may not have adequate coverage against the risk of direct physical damage or to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Moreover, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Insurance risks associated with such catastrophic events could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	This risk is particularly relevant with respect to potential acts of terrorism.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "TRIA"), under which the U.S. federal government bears a significant portion of insured losses caused by terrorism, will expire on December 31, 2020, and there can be no assurance that Congress will act to renew or replace the TRIA following its expiration.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P19_S8	In the event that the TRIA is not renewed or replaced, terrorism insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain at reasonable costs or at all, which may result in adverse impacts and additional costs to us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Changes in the cost or availability of insurance due to the non-renewal of the TRIA or for other reasons could expose us to uninsured casualty losses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss, which may reduce the value of our stockholders investments.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in lower dividends to stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Additionally, mortgage lenders insist in some cases that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Accordingly, to the extent terrorism risk insurance policies are not available at reasonable costs, if at all, our ability to finance or refinance our properties could be impaired.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S7	We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S8	Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, civilian unrest, or war may affect the markets in which we operate our business and our profitability.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S9	Our properties are located in the New York MSA which has experienced, and remains susceptible to, terrorist attacks.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S10	In addition, any kind of terrorist activity or violent criminal acts, including terrorist acts against public institutions or buildings or modes of public transportation (including airlines, trains or buses) could have a negative effect on our business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P20_S11	More generally, any terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including armed conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the worldwide financial markets and economy.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters and discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect our operating results.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations (including those of foreign jurisdictions), a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The costs of removal or remediation could be substantial.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	In addition, when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our projects could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property or development project, which would adversely affect our operating results.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us or our Property Manager and its assignees from operating such properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require us to incur material expenditures.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on the financial condition of co-venturers and disputes between us and our co-venturers.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our largest investment, representing 1.0 million of the 3.4 million rentable square feet in our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 , is our 48.9% equity interest in the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	We may enter into other partnerships and co-ownership arrangements (including preferred equity investments) in which we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our interest in Worldwide Plaza (including our option to purchase the remaining 51.1% interest in Worldwide Plaza) is subject to significant transfer restrictions, which could adversely affect our ability to sell our interest on the most favorable terms without obtaining the consent of our joint venture partner or, in certain circumstances, lender.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	These investments are subject to the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the co-venturer would have full control over the joint venture.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For example, under the Worldwide Plaza joint venture, our joint venture partner is the manager of the joint venture and is responsible for day-to-day management of Worldwide Plaza, although we have consent rights over all major decisions, such as the approval of the annual budget and any decision to sell or encumber the property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Investments in joint ventures may also, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their required capital contributions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Disputes between us and co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Consequently, actions by or disputes with co-venturers might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our co-venturers.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Potential changes in U.S. accounting standards regarding operating leases may make the leasing of our properties less attractive to our potential tenants, which could reduce overall demand for our leasing services.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Under current authoritative accounting guidance for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered to reside with the tenant.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on their balance sheet.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant's balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting and have jointly released exposure drafts of a proposed accounting model that would significantly change lease accounting.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In March 2014, the FASB and IASB deliberated aspects of the joint project, including the lessee and lessor accounting models, lease term, and exemptions and simplifications.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The final standards were released in February 2016.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Changes to the accounting guidance could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These changes may affect how the real estate leasing business is conducted.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	This in turn could make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	There are costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "Disabilities Act").
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our properties are subject to the Disabilities Act.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial facilities" that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	The Disabilities Act's requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire properties in compliance with the Disabilities Act or allocate the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with the Disabilities Act.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S7	Our business could suffer in the event our Advisor or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations experiences system failures or cyber-incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S8	Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the internal information technology systems of our Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P31_S9	Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	A cyber-incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	More specifically, a cyber-incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can result in third parties gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	As reliance on technology in our industry has increased, so have the risks posed to the systems of our Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations, both internal and those that have been outsourced.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	In addition, the risk of a cyber-incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted attacks and intrusions evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The remediation costs and lost revenues experienced by a victim of a cyber-incident may be significant and significant resources may be required to repair system damage, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, loss of revenues and litigation, caused by any breaches.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In addition, a security breach or other significant disruption involving the IT networks and related systems of our Advisor or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations could:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	adversely impact our reputation among our tenants, guests at our hotel and investors generally.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Although our Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, there can be no assurance that those measures will be sufficient, and any material adverse effect experienced by our Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations could, in turn, have an adverse impact on us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Any hedging strategies we utilize may not be successful in mitigating our risks.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We have entered into hedging transactions to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or own real estate assets.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	To the extent that we use derivative financial instruments in connection with these risks, we are exposed to credit, basis and legal enforceability risks.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Derivative financial instruments may include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In this context, credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Basis risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual risks, including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative contract.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	We may not be able to manage these risks effectively.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest Our Sponsor, Advisor, executive officers and other key personnel face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase and leasing of properties, and these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, which could adversely affect our investment opportunities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	To the extent we seek out additional investment opportunities, we rely on the executive officers and other key professionals at our Advisor and our Property Manager to identify suitable investment opportunities for us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	Several of the other key professionals of our Advisor are also the key professionals at the parent of our Sponsor and their other public programs, and our executive officers are also executive officers of American Realty Capital New York City REIT, Inc. ("ARC NYCR"), which is a non-traded REIT sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor that has investment objectives similar to ours.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S6	The Allocation Agreement provides that acquisitions of properties identified for acquisition by our Advisor or the advisor to ARC NYCR requires rotation among us and this entity depending on which one of us has sufficient capital to acquire all or some of the property acquisitions and which of us most recently made a property acquisition.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S7	As a result, we may not be able to acquire a property that we desire because of this agreement.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S8	In addition, other programs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor that are not parties to the Allocation Agreement own properties, or may seek to acquire properties, in the New York MSA.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S9	Thus, a conflict could arise between us and one or more of these programs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor to acquire or sell a property, lease vacant space or renew existing leases.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S10	Conflicts of interest also may exist at such time as we or our affiliates managing properties on our behalf seek to employ developers, contractors or building managers, as well as under other circumstances.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P38_S11	Also, we may acquire properties from, or sell properties to, other programs sponsored by the parent of our Sponsor.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our officers and directors face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with our Advisor, our Property Manager and other affiliated entities, which could hinder our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Certain of our executive officers, including Michael A. Happel, our chief executive officer and president, Nicholas Radesca, our interim chief financial officer, and Patrick O'Malley, our chief investment officer, also are officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager and other affiliated entities, including the advisor and property manager of ARC NYCR, which is a non-traded REIT sponsored by our Sponsor that has investment objectives similar to ours.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Some of our directors also are directors of other non-traded REITs sponsored by affiliates of the parent of our Sponsor.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	As a result, these individuals owe fiduciary duties to these other entities and their stockholders, which may result in them taking actions or making decisions that conflict with the duties that they owe to us and our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	These conflicts could result in actions or inactions that are detrimental to our business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of investments and management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) our purchase of properties from, or sale of properties, to entities sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor, (c) the timing and terms of the investment in or sale of an asset, (d) investments with entities sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor, (e) compensation to our Advisor and its affiliates including our Property Manager, and (f) any decision to sell our company or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Moreover, the management of multiple REITs by certain of the officers and other key personnel of our Advisor may significantly reduce the amount of time they are able to spend on our activities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the structure of the fees they receive, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Under our advisory agreement, the partnership agreement of our OP, and the OPP (as defined herein), our Advisor and its affiliates are entitled to certain fees and other compensation which, because the Advisor does not maintain a significant equity interest in us and is entitled to receive substantial minimum compensation regardless of performance, may result in its interests not being wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	For example, our Advisor could be motivated to recommend riskier or more speculative investments with the hope that doing so will result in us generating the specified levels of total return that would entitle our Advisor to certain incentive fees and compensation as well as increase the number of LTIP units (as defined herein) that the Advisor would earn.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, our advisory agreement, property management agreement and other agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates include covenants and conditions that are subject to interpretation and could result in disagreements.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Moreover, the OPP provides for early calculation of earned LTIP units and for the accelerated vesting of any earned LTIP units in the event the Advisor is terminated or in the event of a change in control of our company, which could motivate our Advisor to recommend a transaction that would result in a change in control under the OPP when such a transaction would not otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence 2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We may be unable to pay or maintain dividends from cash available from operations or increase dividends over time.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Many factors affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	We have not generated and may not in the future generate operating cash flows sufficient to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders at the current rate.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	During 2015, our dividends were paid from a combination of cash flow from our operations, proceeds from the redemption of our preferred equity investment and distributions in respect of our interest in Worldwide Plaza, but we have in the past been, and may again in the future be, required to borrow funds to fund dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	During 2016, we do not expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations to pay dividends at our current rate.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	We expect to be able to pay dividends from a combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S6	Actual cash available for dividends may vary substantially from our estimates.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S7	If our cash flow from operations and cash on hand are not sufficient, we may need to borrow funds, potentially at higher rates, or depend on our Advisor or our Property Manager to waive fees or reimbursement of certain expenses, which they are not required to do, to fund our operations and any dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S8	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds from such sources, or pay or maintain our current level of dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P42_S9	Moreover, our failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash dividends likely would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may fluctuate.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We depend on our OP and its subsidiaries for cash flow and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of our OP and its subsidiaries.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Our only significant asset is the general partnership interests we own in our OP and assets held by us for the use and benefit of our OP.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We conduct, and intend to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our OP.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Accordingly, we rely on distributions from our OP and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P45_S4	The limited partnership units of the OP entitled "OP Units" ("OP units") owned by our Advisor and its affiliates and employees are also entitled to distributions from the OP in the same amount as dividends paid on shares of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Until such time as the limited partnership units of the OP entitled "LTIP Units" ("LTIP units") held by our Advisor are fully earned in accordance with the provisions of the OPP, the LTIP units are entitled to distributions equal to 10% of the distributions made on the OP units.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P45_S6	After the LTIP units are fully earned, they are entitled to a catch-up distribution and then the same distributions as the OP units.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There is no assurance that our OP or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay distributions to us that will enable us to pay dividends to our stockholders or distributions to holders of OP units and holders of LTIP units from cash flows from operations or otherwise pay any other obligations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Each of our OP's subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from these entities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition, because we are a holding company, stockholder claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our OP and its subsidiaries.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our assets and those of our OP and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy stockholder claims as stockholders only after all of our and our OP's and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S4	Existing stockholders interests will be diluted if we issue additional shares.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S5	Existing stockholders do not have preemptive rights to any shares issued by us in the future.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S6	Our charter currently authorizes us to issue 350 million shares of stock, of which 300 million shares are classified as common stock and 50 million are classified as preferred stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S7	Our board of directors may amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of stock, or the number of authorized shares of any class or series of stock, or may classify or reclassify any unissued shares into the classes or series of stock without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S8	Except for preferred stock, all of our shares may be issued in the discretion of our board of directors.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S9	Existing stockholders likely will suffer dilution of their equity investment in us, if we: (a) sell additional shares in the future; (b) sell securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock; (c) issue shares of our common stock in a private offering of securities to institutional investors; (d) issue restricted share awards to our directors; or (e) issue shares to our Advisor or its affiliates, successors or assigns, in payment of an outstanding fee obligation as set forth under our advisory agreement or other agreements.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S10	In addition, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with an exchange of OP units.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S11	The holders of outstanding OP units generally may, subject to certain restrictions, exchange OP units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock or, at the election of our OP, a corresponding number of shares of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S12	Following redemptions of OP units that resulted in issuance of 2,515,406 shares of common stock during February 2016 to individual members and employees of the Advisor, the Advisor and its affiliates, including certain of our current and former directors and executive officers, owned 1,662,684 OP units.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P46_S13	As of December 31, 2015 , individual members of our Advisor, including our chief executive officer, and William M. Kahane, one of our directors, also owned 8,880,579 LTIP units, which were issued to our Advisor in connection with the listing of our common stock in April 2014 (the "Listing").
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	LTIP units are convertible into OP units subject to being earned and vested and several other conditions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We may also issue OP units to sellers of properties acquired by us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If we issue preferred stock, the holders thereof will, upon liquidation, be entitled to receive distributions of liquidation proceeds prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Additionally, any preferred stock including convertible preferred stock or other securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for common stock that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and will result in dilution to owners of our common stock if converted, exercised or exchanged for common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Any preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay dividends to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the value of our common stock and diluting the interest of existing stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers, directors and our Advisor are limited, which could reduce recoveries against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation's best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	In addition, subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors, our officers and our Advisor and our Advisor's affiliates and permits us to indemnify our employees and agents.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	We and our stockholders also may have more limited rights against our directors, officers, employees and agents, and our Advisor and its affiliates, than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce recoveries against them.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P48_S6	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents, or our Advisor and its affiliates in some cases.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Similarly, this restriction further limits a stockholder's ability to sell shares.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P55_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Pursuant to the statute, our board of directors has exempted any business combination involving our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P58_S2	Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and our Advisor or any affiliate of our Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P58_S3	As a result, our Advisor and any of its affiliates may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the super-majority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P58_S4	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P58_S5	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large stake in us and exercise voting power in electing directors, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholder.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	"Control shares" are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Office Industry Risks Declines in overall activity in the New York MSA may adversely affect the performance of our office properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	A total of 82% of our properties measured by rentable square feet as of December 31, 2015 were comprised of commercial office properties located in the New York MSA.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Rental income from office properties fluctuates with general market and economic conditions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Our office properties may be adversely affected by market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Because our portfolio includes commercial office buildings located in the New York MSA, which has a relatively large number of financial and professional services sector, significant job losses in the financial and professional services sector, which may decrease demand for office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S5	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S6	The loss of anchor tenants for our office properties could adversely affect our profitability.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S7	A lease termination by a tenant that occupies a large area of space in one of our office properties (commonly referred to as an anchor tenant) could impact leases of other tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S8	Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of a lease termination by an anchor tenant or the closure of the business of an anchor tenant that leaves its space vacant, even if the anchor tenant continues to pay rent.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S9	Any such modifications or conditions could be unfavorable to us as the property owner and could decrease rents or expense recoveries.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P62_S10	In the event of default by an anchor tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We may be adversely affected by certain trends that reduce demand for office real estate.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Some businesses are rapidly evolving to increasingly permit employee telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	These practices enable businesses to reduce their space requirements.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	A continuation of the movement towards these practices could over time erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Retail Industry Risks Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P64_S1	A total of 10% of our property holdings measured by rentable square feet as of December 31, 2015 is comprised of commercial retail properties located in the New York MSA.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P65_S0	A retail property's revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P65_S1	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our common stock may be negatively impacted.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Some of our leases provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P65_S3	We also have leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P65_S4	Under those leases which contain contingent rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P66_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we derive from contingent rent leases could decline in a general economic downturn.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P68_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P69_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant's lease is terminated.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S1	These "co-tenancy" provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S8	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S9	Our retail tenants face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as retailing conducted through internet websites (which we refer to as e-commerce), discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs and telemarketing.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S10	Other retail centers within the market area of our properties may compete with our properties for customers, affecting their tenants' cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S11	In addition, some of our tenants' rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P70_S12	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P71_S0	E-commerce can have an impact on our business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The use of the internet by consumers continues to gain popularity.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The migration towards e-commerce is expected to continue.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P72_S2	This increase in internet sales could result in a downturn in the business of our current tenants in their "brick and mortar" locations and could affect the way future tenants lease space.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P72_S3	While we devote considerable effort and resources to analyze and respond to tenant trends, preferences and consumer spending patterns, we cannot predict with certainty what future tenants will want, what future retail spaces will look like and how much revenue will be generated at traditional "brick and mortar" locations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P72_S4	If we are unable to anticipate and respond promptly to trends in the market, our occupancy levels and financial results could suffer.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Lodging Industry Risks Our hotel is subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P73_S1	One of the properties we own is a hotel located in New York City that is subject to all the risks of the hotel industry, particularly the hotel industry in the New York MSA, which may include:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P74_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P74_S1	In addition, the hotel industry may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as extreme weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P75_S0	As a REIT, we cannot directly or indirectly operate our lodging property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P75_S1	We cannot and do not directly or indirectly operate our lodging property and instead must rely on the ability of a third-party hotel management company to operate our lodging property successfully.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any lodging property or actively participate in the decisions affecting its daily operations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P75_S3	Any lodging properties that we own or may acquire are or will be leased to one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"), which enter into hotel management agreements with third-party hotel management companies to operate the properties that we lease to a TRS.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P75_S4	We cannot and do not control these third-party hotel management companies, who are responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P75_S5	Thus, even if we believe our lodging property is being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party hotel management company to change its method of operation.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P75_S6	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator generally may adversely affect the performance of our lodging property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We rely on a third-party hotel management company to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S1	We do not, however, control the design or implementation of or changes to these internal controls.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S2	We may not be able to require the third-party hotel management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S3	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S4	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S5	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party hotel management company has implemented at our lodging property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S6	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at our lodging property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S7	If we replace a third-party hotel management company, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at the affected lodging properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S8	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party hotel management company with substantial prior lodging experience in the future and could experience disruptions in our operations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S9	Our use of the TRS structure increases our expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P76_S10	A TRS structure subjects us to the risk of increased lodging operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The performance of any TRS is based on the operations of the applicable lodging property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Our operating risks include not only changes in hotel revenues and changes to our TRSs' ability to pay the rent due to us under the leases, but also increased hotel operating expenses, including, but not limited to, the following cost elements:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P78_S0	There are risks associated with employing hotel employees.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P78_S1	We are generally subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel employees.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The lodging properties we acquire are leased to one or more TRSs, which enter into hotel management agreements with third-party hotel management companies to operate the lodging properties that we lease to a TRS.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P78_S3	Hotel operating revenues and expenses for these properties are included in our consolidated results of operations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P78_S4	As a result, although we do not directly employ or manage the labor force at our lodging properties, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Our third-party property manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each our lodging properties and for establishing and maintaining the appropriate processes and controls over such activities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P79_S1	From time to time, the operations of our lodging properties may be disrupted through strikes, public demonstrations or other labor actions and related publicity.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P79_S2	We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of the aforementioned disruptions, or contract disputes or other events.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Our third-party property manager may be targeted by union actions or adversely impacted by the disruption caused by organizing activities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P79_S4	We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Our business is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The total principal amount of our combined outstanding indebtedness, which generally comprises mortgage loans on our properties, our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's indebtedness and the term loan and revolving components of our Credit Facility with Capital One, was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S2	We rely on both secured and unsecured, variable rate and non-variable rate debt to finance acquisitions and development activities and for working capital.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S3	We have also funded a portion of the dividends that we have paid in the past with the proceeds from borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S4	We may also borrow if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S5	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S6	We may be unable to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P80_S7	Our substantial indebtedness and the cash flow associated with serving our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the risks that:
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P81_S0	prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) may result in higher interest rates, which could adversely affect net income, cash flow and our ability to service debt and pay dividends to stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P82_S0	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P82_S1	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of an investment in our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P82_S2	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P82_S3	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P82_S4	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of dividends required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P83_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P83_S1	If we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the value of an investment in our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S2	Covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness could limit our operational and financial flexibility or result in covenant breaches.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Our Credit Facility contains certain financial and operating covenants that limit our financial and operational flexibility.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S4	The operating covenants limit our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt, sell all or substantially all of our assets, make restricted payments (including dividends to our stockholders), engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates and take certain other actions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S5	In addition, our Credit Facility requires us to meet certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S6	Additionally, we may be restricted from selling additional properties without amending or repaying our Credit Facility because of requirements in our Credit Facility as to the minimum number of properties in our borrowing base.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S7	The mortgage loans we have, or may in the future enter into, include, and may include, other financial and operating covenants, including transfer restrictions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S8	The mortgages relating to many of the properties we have acquired include restrictions, such as prepayment penalties or assumption fees, that could affect our ability to sell properties or the net proceeds we would realize upon a sale.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S9	These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that would otherwise be in our best interest and adversely affect our ability to complete sales of our assets.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S10	In the event that we fail to satisfy our covenants, we would be in default under our unsecured Credit Facility and may be required to repay our indebtedness with capital from other sources.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S11	Under such circumstances, other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S12	Our available capacity under our Credit Facility depends on our borrowing base properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S13	As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding balance of the term loan and revolving components of our Credit Facility was $305.0 million and $180.0 million , respectively.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S14	While the aggregate commitments under the Credit Facility allow for total borrowings of up to $705.0 million with a $305.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving loan and contain an accordion feature to allow us, under certain circumstances and to the extent agreed to by our lenders, to increase the aggregate loan borrowings to up to $1.0 billion of total borrowings, the actual availability of borrowings under our Credit Facility for any period is based on requirements outlined in our Credit Facility with respect to the pool of eligible unencumbered assets that comprise our borrowing base properties.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P84_S15	The unused borrowing capacity, based on the debt service coverage ratio of the borrowing base properties as of December 31, 2015 , was $63.0 million .
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P85_S0	All but two of our properties not otherwise subject to mortgage loans collateralize the borrowing base of our Credit Facility and have mortgages recorded for that purpose.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P85_S1	If the financial results of the borrowing base properties deteriorate, or if their values decline, the maximum availability under the Credit Facility may decline and we may be required to make mandatory repayments of principal outstanding to avoid a default under the Credit Facility, absent an amendment or waiver.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Dispositions of borrowing base properties will have a similar effect.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P85_S3	If we are unable to borrow under our Credit Facility due to a decrease in the available capacity or for any other reason, we may be prevented from acquiring additional properties, funding our working capital needs or our dividends to our stockholders, and other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P85_S4	A decrease in the available capacity under our Credit Facility could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S0	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We have incurred substantial indebtedness, of which $710.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , among other things, bears interest at variable interest rates.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We have not entered into any swaps, and have purchased LIBOR caps on only $305.0 million of this variable rate indebtedness, to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates on this variable rate indebtedness.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S3	Accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S4	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S5	U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S6	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S7	However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in our best interests, or inadvertently.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S8	Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S9	The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S10	Furthermore, any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service ( the "IRS") and is not a guarantee that we will qualify, or continue to qualify, as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S11	Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S12	Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S13	Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S14	Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S15	Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S16	If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S17	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S18	Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S19	In addition, dividends to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to pay dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S20	If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable tax.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S21	Even if we qualify as a REIT, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S22	Even if we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P86_S23	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are "dealer" properties sold by a REIT (a "prohibited transaction" under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P87_S0	We may not distribute sufficient dividends to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P87_S1	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P87_S2	In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P87_S3	However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our OP or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P89_S0	To qualify as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P89_S1	This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P90_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P90_S1	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which dividends we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P90_S2	These requirements could cause us to distribute amounts that otherwise would be spent on investments in real estate assets and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds, possibly at unfavorable rates, or sell assets to fund these distributions.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P90_S3	It is possible that we might not always be able to pay distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings while we qualify as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P91_S1	For so long as we qualify as a REIT, our ability to dispose of property during the first few years following acquisition may be restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT qualification.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P91_S2	Under applicable provisions of the Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary entity, including our OP, but generally excluding TRSs, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P92_S0	Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P92_S1	We intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (a) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a TRS (but such TRS would incur corporate rate income taxes with respect to any income or gain recognized by it), (b) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction, or (c) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with the requirements of the prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Code for properties that, among other requirements, have been held for at least two years.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P92_S2	Despite our present intention, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or through any subsidiary entity, including our OP, but generally excluding TRSs will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P93_S0	A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P93_S2	A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P94_S0	Overall, no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the gross value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P95_S0	A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P95_S1	We will lease any "qualified lodging facilities" we own to one or more TRSs which in turn contract with independent third-party hotel management companies to operate such "qualified lodging facilities" on behalf of such TRSs.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P95_S2	We may use our TRSs generally for other activities as well, such as to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P96_S0	A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In addition, the rules, which are applicable to us as a REIT, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P96_S2	If our leases to our TRSs are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P96_S3	In order for rent to qualify as "rents from real property" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P96_S4	If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S0	If our OP failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S1	We intend to maintain the status of our OP as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S2	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our OP as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S3	In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that our OP could make to us.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S4	This also would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S5	This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay dividends and the yield on an investment in our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S6	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which our OP owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the OP.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P97_S7	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S0	We may choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case the stockholder may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes in excess of the cash dividends received by them.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S1	In connection with our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S2	In order to satisfy this requirement, we may pay dividends that are payable in cash and/or shares of our common stock (which could account for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such dividends) at the election of each stockholder.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S3	Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of such dividends as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S4	As a result, U.S. stockholders may be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash portion of the dividend received.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S5	Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a dividend of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such dividend or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such dividend.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S6	If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S7	Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such dividend and using the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S8	Various tax aspects of such a taxable cash/stock dividend are uncertain and have not yet been addressed by the IRS.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P98_S9	No assurance can be given that the IRS will not impose requirements in the future with respect to taxable cash/stock dividends, including on a retroactive basis, or assert that the requirements for such taxable cash/stock dividends have not been met.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The taxation of amounts paid to our stockholders may be taxable as ordinary income, which may reduce the anticipated return from an investment in our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Amounts that we pay to our stockholders generally referred to herein as "dividends" will generally be taxable as ordinary income if paid out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income).
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P99_S2	However, a portion of amounts paid to our stockholders may (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us, (2) be designated by us as qualified dividend income generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from our TRSs, or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that the payment exceeds our accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P99_S3	A return of capital is not taxable, but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder's investment in our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P100_S0	Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Currently, the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P100_S3	Although this does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P101_S0	Tax rates could be changed in future legislation.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P102_S1	The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or in certain cases to hedge previously acquired hedges entered into to manage risks associated with property that has been disposed of or liabilities that have been extinguished, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P102_S3	To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P102_S4	As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P102_S5	This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P102_S6	In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forego and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S2	In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) and no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S4	As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S5	These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S6	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S7	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S8	While we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in our best interests.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S9	If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P104_S10	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the market price of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and there can be no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on their investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P105_S4	Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P105_S5	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P105_S6	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our shares of stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares of stock under this requirement.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S2	Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S3	To help ensure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of our shares of stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S4	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT while we so qualify.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S5	Unless exempted by our board of directors, for so long as we qualify as a REIT, our charter prohibits, among other limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock, any person from beneficially or constructively owning (applying certain attribution rules under the Code) more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S6	Our board of directors may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would result in the termination of our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S7	These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S8	These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S9	Recharacterization of sale-leaseback transactions may cause us to lose our REIT status.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S10	If we enter into sale-leaseback transactions, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to structure any such sale- leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a "true lease" for tax purposes, thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S11	The IRS may, however, challenge the characterization.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S12	In the event that any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and recharacterized as a financing transaction or loan for U.S. federal income tax purposes, deductions for depreciation and cost recovery relating to the property would be disallowed.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S13	If a sale-leaseback transaction were so recharacterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT qualification "asset tests" or "income tests" and, consequently, lose our REIT status effective with the year of recharacterization.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P107_S14	Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated which might also cause us to fail to meet the distribution requirement for a taxable year.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P108_S1	Subject to certain exceptions, amounts paid by us to our stockholders will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P108_S2	These dividends ordinarily will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the dividends are treated as "effectively connected" with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ("FIRPTA") capital gain dividends attributable to sales or exchanges of "U.S. real property interests" ("USRPIs") generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder (other than a qualified pension plan, entities wholly owned by a qualified pension plan and certain foreign publicly traded entities) as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P109_S1	However, a capital gain dividend will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10% of the class of our stock at any time during the one- year period ending on the date the dividend is received.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P109_S2	Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P109_S3	Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a "domestically-controlled qualified investment entity".
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P109_S4	A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT's stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P109_S5	We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically- controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P109_S6	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if (a) our common stock is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 10% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P110_S0	Potential characterization of dividends or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax- exempt investors.
1474464_16_ITEM1A_P110_S1	If (a) we are a "pension-held REIT," (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred (or is deemed to have incurred) debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Code.

1474464_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	Dividends We have elected to qualify as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	The amount actually paid to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including the amount of funds available, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, the restricted payments covenant in our Credit Facility with Capital One, as applicable, and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P1_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with this covenant.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P1_S4	From December 2010 to April 2014, our board of directors approved and we declared and paid monthly dividends at an annualized rate equal to $0.605 per share of common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the applicable period at a per share rate of $0.0016575342 per day.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P1_S5	In April 2014, our board of directors approved a change in this rate and we began paying monthly dividends at an annualized rate equal to $0.46 per share of common stock, beginning with the April 2014 payment.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P1_S6	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of dividends or distributions paid or suspend payments at any time.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividend payments are made to stockholders of record at the close of business on the 8th day of each month, and paid on the 15th day of such month.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P2_S1	Future dividend payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	The following table details, from a U.S. federal income tax perspective, the portion of amounts paid to stockholders treated as a return of capital and capital gain dividends per share per annum for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 :

1474464_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	_________________ (1) Excludes distributions paid to our non-controlling partner in 163 Washington Avenue as a result of the sale of the property in October 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P5_S0	During 2015 , our dividends were paid from a combination of cash available from our operations, proceeds from the redemption of our preferred equity investment and distributions in respect of our interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P5_S1	During 2016, we do not expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations to pay dividends at our current rate.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P5_S2	We expect to be able to pay dividends from a combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P5_S3	Actual cash available for dividends may vary substantially from our estimates.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P5_S4	If our cash flow from operations and cash on hand are not sufficient, we may need to borrow funds, potentially at higher rates, or depend on our Advisor or our Property Manager to waive fees or reimbursement of certain expenses, which they are not required to do, to fund our operations and any dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P5_S5	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds from such sources, or pay or maintain our current level of dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P6_S0	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM5_P6_S1	We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include: Revenue Recognition Our revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, GAAP require us to record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P0_S5	We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P0_S6	When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	For the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, we evaluate whether we own or the tenant owns the tenant improvements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	When we are the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is when such improvements are substantially complete.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	When we conclude that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	When we conclude that we are the owner of tenant improvements, we capitalize the cost to construct the tenant improvements, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	When we conclude that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred leasing costs, net on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we will record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	We own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, we defer the recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	If we own certain properties with leases that include these provisions, contingent rental income will be included in rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our hotel revenues are recognized as earned and are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	Investments in Real Estate We evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	In business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective estimated fair values.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the comparable fair market lease rate, measured over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S5	The fair value of other intangible assets, such as real estate tax abatements, are recorded based on the present value of the expected benefit and amortized over the expected useful life including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S6	Fair values of assumed mortgages, if applicable, are recorded as debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above- or below-market interest rates.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P8_S7	Non-controlling interests in property owning entities are recorded based on the fair value of units issued at the date of acquisition, as determined by the terms of the applicable agreement.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	We utilize a number of sources in making our estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	We also consider information and other factors including: market conditions, the industry in which the tenant operates, characteristics of the real estate such as location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	Disposals of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented; otherwise, we continue to report the results of these properties' operations within continuing operations.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Properties that are intended to be sold will be designated as "held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs for all periods presented when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to seven years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Acquired above-market leases are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	Acquired below-market leases are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Acquired above-market ground leases are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Acquired below-market ground leases are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option period.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above- and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	If such estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is based on the adjustment to estimated fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Generally, we determine estimated fair value for properties held for sale based on the agreed-upon selling price of an asset.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	These assessments may result in the immediate recognition of an impairment loss, resulting in a reduction of net income (loss).
1474464_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	If we designate a qualifying derivative as a hedge, changes in the value of the derivative are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	If a derivative does not qualify as a hedge, or if we elect not to apply hedge accounting, changes in the value of the derivative are reflected in other income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	The revised guidance was to become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	Early adoption was not permitted under GAAP.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P20_S4	The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P20_S5	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revised guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P20_S6	We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships) and provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.

1474464_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	The amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	In August 2015, the FASB added that, for line of credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	The revised guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued an update that eliminates the requirement to adjust provisional amounts from a business combination and the related impact on earnings by restating prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on current and prior periods, including the prior period impact on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items and their related tax effects, shall be recognized in the period the adjustment amount is determined.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	The cumulative adjustment would be reflected within the respective financial statement line items affected.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P25_S4	We have elected to adopt the new guidance as of September 30, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P25_S5	The adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued an update that amends the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The new guidance significantly revises an entity s accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Among other things, it also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.

1474464_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	We continue to market the remaining vacant space in our portfolio.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Although ending occupancy was largely unchanged year-over-year, we re-leased our expiring spaces at increases per square foot of 52% and 62% on a cash and straight-line basis, respectively, over prior rents.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The following is a summary of our quarterly leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 :
1474464_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	______________________________ (1) Replacement leases are for space that was leased during the period that was previously leased to another expired or terminated tenant at some time during the prior twelve months.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	(2) Prior escalated rent is calculated as total annualized income less electric charges.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	It includes base rent, excluding recoveries.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The following is a summary of lease expirations for the next five years, as of December 31, 2015 :
1474464_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	_________________ (1) Combined reflects 100% of consolidated properties plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated properties.

1474464_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2015 , net loss attributable to stockholders was $39.1 million compared to $93.0 million and $19.3 million , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 22 properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015, we acquired one property, 245-249 West 17th Street (our "2014 Acquisition") and sold one property, 163 Washington Avenue, (our "2015 Disposition").
1474464_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	Additionally, our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street ("123 William Street") was redeemed in March 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	We consider properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior periods to be our same store properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	Our "2015 Same Store" excludes the activity related to our 2014 Acquisition, 2015 Disposition and 123 William Street.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Rental Income Rental income increased $11.9 million to $129.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , from $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	The increase in rental income was primarily driven by our 2014 Acquisition, which resulted in an increase in rental income of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	We experienced a net decrease in rental income at our 2015 Same Store of $3.2 million primarily related to lease modifications and terminations at 229 W. 36th Street, 256 W. 38th Street and 1440 Broadway as well as a reduction in rental income related to a fully amortized below-market lease at 333 W. 34th Street.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	The net decrease in our 2015 Same Store was partially offset by increased rental revenue at 50 Varick Street, due to a lease modification, and 218 W. 18th Street and the Design Center due to lease commencements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	The decrease in rental revenue associated with our 2015 Disposition was $0.4 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	Operating Expense Reimbursements and Other Revenue Operating expense reimbursements and other revenue increased $3.7 million to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily due to $1.4 million in operating expense reimbursements related to our 2014 Acquisition and higher recoveries of $2.3 million in our 2015 Same Store due to lease commencements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S6	The increase also related to a fee paid by a tenant upon the expiration of its lease at 1440 Broadway in lieu of restoring the space to its original condition prior to vacating.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S7	Pursuant to many of our lease agreements, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of certain property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S8	Therefore, operating expense reimbursements are directly affected by changes in property operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S9	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $6.6 million to $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , from $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S10	The increase in property operating expenses primarily related to real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and security associated with our 2014 Acquisition, which resulted in an increase of $3.3 million in property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S11	Property operating expenses increased $2.7 million in our 2015 Same Store for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily related to increased real estate taxes, utilities, security and maintenance expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S12	Property operating expenses also increased year over year because the Advisor did not absorb any expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S13	During the prior year, the Advisor absorbed $0.6 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S14	The increase in property operating expenses was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease related to our 2015 Disposition.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S15	Hotel Operations Hotel revenues increased $3.4 million to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , from $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S16	Hotel operating expenses increased $1.7 million to $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , from $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S17	The increase in hotel revenues and hotel operating expenses related primarily to increased average occupancy at the Viceroy Hotel of 80.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to 68.8% during the year ended December 31, 2014 as well as revenue per available room (commonly referred to in the hotel industry as "RevPAR") of $276.70 for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to $241.39 for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S18	Operating Fees Incurred from the Advisor Operating fees incurred from the Advisor were $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P36_S19	Operating fees incurred from the Advisor represent asset management fees earned by the Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Prior to the Listing, we issued to the Advisor restricted performance based Class B units for prior asset management services, which vested as of the Listing.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	As such, the increase was related to paying asset management fees in cash for a full year.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our Property Manager is entitled to fees for the management of our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenues.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	Our Property Manager elected to waive these fees for the year s ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	For the year s ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we would have incurred property management fees of $2.6 million and $1.7 million , respectively, had these fees not been waived.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P38_S4	Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the debt refinancing transactions which we entered into during the third quarter 2015, litigation at Worldwide Plaza and professional fees incurred related to the exploration of a possible strategic transaction.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P38_S5	Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $4.4 million in acquisition fees and expense reimbursements for the purchase of our 2014 Acquisition as well as costs associated with our Listing.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Vesting of Asset Management Fees Vesting of asset management fees expense of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the vesting of Class B units previously issued to the Advisor for asset management services.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The performance condition related to these Class B units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing, as such this expense did not recur for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	On April 15, 2014, the Class B units were converted to OP units on a one-to-one basis.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	Value of Listing Note Value of Listing Note (as defined in Note 9 Subordinated Listing Distribution to our consolidated financial statements expense of $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the final value of the Listing Note, which was determined and fully expensed in the fourth quarter of 2014.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	As such, this expense did not recur for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $15.0 million to $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	Equity-based compensation expenses, which are not settled in cash, contributed a large portion of the year-over-year increase in total general and administrative expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P41_S4	These expenses increased $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, due to a full year of amortization of the fair value of the OPP and a higher year-over-year fair value of the OPP, which was adopted in conjunction with the Listing.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	The valuation of our OPP is largely dependent on the trading price of shares of our common stock in the absolute sense and relative to the share prices of our peer group.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	Because we are required under GAAP to remeasure the OPP quarterly, our equity-based compensation expenses tend to be volatile.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	See Note 16 Share-Based Compensation to the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S3	The increase in remaining general and administrative expenses, which are settled in cash, was largely associated with a $5.5 million increase in legal and professional fees primarily related to the audit of our 2014 financial statements being recognized in full during 2015 due to our change of auditors in February 2015, the engagement of internal auditors and the recognition of expenses incurred relating to the audit of our 2015 financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S4	Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2015, our Advisor began requesting reimbursement for general and administrative expenses, which amounted to $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S5	Our Advisor elected to absorb $1.4 million of general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 , which did not recur for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S6	The increases in other general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreases in transfer agent and proxy costs of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the Advisor renegotiating their service contracts.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S7	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.1 million to $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to $84.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S8	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to a decrease of $7.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense in our 2015 Same Store primarily related to lease modifications and terminations at 229 W. 36th Street, 333 W. 34th Street and 1440 Broadway as well as $0.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense related to our 2015 Disposition.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S9	These decreases were partially offset by $5.7 million in depreciation and amortization expense related to our 2014 Acquisition.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S10	Interest Expense Interest expense increased $5.7 million to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S11	The increase in interest expense is partially related to a higher weighted average Credit Facility balance outstanding of $597.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to $439.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S12	In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into several financing transactions, including the issuance of a mortgage note payable secured by our property located at 1440 Broadway, which contributed $3.4 million to the increase in interest expense.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S13	In connection with these third quarter financing transactions, we also repaid four mortgage notes payable and settled through legal defeasance two mortgage notes payable before the scheduled maturity dates to allow for their inclusion in the borrowing base of our Credit Facility and accelerated $1.1 million of expense for the write-off of financing costs related to those mortgages.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P42_S14	Additionally, financing costs incurred of $4.0 million and $6.5 million , relating to the Credit Facility and the 1440 Broadway mortgage, respectively, were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the respective maturity dates of the debt instruments to which they are allocated.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Venture Income (loss) from unconsolidated joint venture was $1.9 million of income for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1.5 million of loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 , which represents our preferred distribution, net of our pro rata share of the net income or loss of Worldwide Plaza and the amortization of the difference in basis between our investment and the book value of Worldwide Plaza's net assets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Income from unconsolidated joint venture increased in part due to increasing occupancy at Worldwide Plaza to 100.0% as of December 31, 2015 from 93.3% as of December 31, 2014 and 91.2% as of October 31, 2013, the date we acquired our interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	Income from Preferred Equity Investment, Investment Securities and Interest Income from preferred equity investment, investment securities and interest decreased $1.8 million to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	The primary driver for the decrease was a decline in income related to our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street, which was redeemed in March 2015, of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	The decline was partially offset by a gain on the sale of investment securities of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S5	Gain on Sale of Real Estate Investment, Net Gain on sale of real estate investment, net of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to the gain we recognized on the sale of our 2015 Disposition of $8.4 million partially offset by an impairment charge on Duane Reade of $0.9 million , recognized as a result of reclassifying the assets of that property to held-for-sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S6	Gain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments Loss on derivative instruments of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to missed forecast derivative losses recognized upon the early repayment of the mortgages securing One Jackson Square and 229 West 36th Street and the resulting cancellation of the interest rate swaps on those mortgages.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S7	Mark-to-market adjustments on our 1440 Broadway interest rate caps, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, further contributed to the loss on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S8	We recognized approximately $1,000 of gain on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S9	The net loss attributable to non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 million and $1.3 million , respectively.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P43_S10	The decrease of $0.1 million in net loss attributable to non-controlling is primarily related to our 2015 Disposition and the repayment of our partner in that property as well as lower allocable net loss.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2014 to Year Ended December 31, 2013 As of December 31, 2014, we owned 24 properties and real estate-related assets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	As of January 1, 2013, we owned 16 properties (our "2014 Same Store").
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	We acquired eight properties and real estate related assets from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 (our "2013/2014 Acquisitions").
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	Accordingly, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, reflect significant increases in most categories.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S4	Rental Income Rental income increased $67.7 million to $117.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S5	The increase in rental income was primarily driven by our 2013/2014 Acquisitions, which resulted in an increase in rental income of $66.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , as well as lease termination fees of $1.6 million related to a partial lease termination and modification at 229 West 36th Street.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S6	This was partially offset by a net decrease in rental income in our 2014 Same Store of $0.8 million primarily due to net leasing activity at 416 Washington Street as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S7	The terminated space at 416 Washington Street was re-leased in September 2014, resulting in a fully occupied property as of December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S8	We also began self-managing the garage at 416 Washington Street in December 2013 through a third-party national operator.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S9	Parking revenue associated with self-management is higher than the rental income we would have received; however, this parking revenue is included in operating expense reimbursements and other revenue.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S10	Operating Expense Reimbursements and Other Revenue Operating expense reimbursements and other revenue increased $11.5 million to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to our 2013/2014 Acquisitions, which resulted in an increase of $10.6 million in operating expense reimbursements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P44_S11	Operating expense reimbursements and other revenue at our 2014 Same Store increased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , primarily related to parking revenue due to the switch to self-managing the garage at 416 Washington Street in December 2013 and an increase in property operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Pursuant to many of our lease agreements, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of certain property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	Therefore, operating expense reimbursements are directly affected by changes in property operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $24.7 million to $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	The increase in property operating expenses primarily related to real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and ground rent associated with our 2013/2014 Acquisitions, which resulted in an increase of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S4	Property operating expenses increased $0.6 million in our 2014 Same Store, primarily related to increased real estate taxes, utilities, security and maintenance expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S5	This increase was partially offset by absorption of certain property operating costs of $0.6 million by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S6	The Advisor did not absorb any property operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S7	Hotel Revenue and Operating Expenses Hotel revenues increased $20.4 million to $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S8	Hotel operating expenses increased $21.3 million to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S9	The increase in hotel revenues and hotel operating expenses related to a full year of operations at the Viceroy Hotel, which we purchased in November 2013.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S10	Operating Fees Incurred from the Advisor Operating fees to affiliates were $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P45_S11	Operating fees incurred from the Advisor represent asset management fees earned by the Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Prior to the Listing, we issued the Advisor restricted performance based Class B units for prior asset management services, which vested as of the Listing.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	As such, there were no operating fees incurred from the Advisor for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Our Property Manager is entitled to fees for the management of our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenues.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our Property Manager elected to waive these fees for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we would have incurred property management fees of $1.7 million and $0.8 million , respectively, had these fees not been waived.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S4	Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $4.4 million relating to our acquisition of our 2014 Acquisition as well as Listing-related costs.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S5	Listing-related costs mainly consisted of $8.9 million of investment banking, advisory and other services provided by the Former Dealer Manager and its affiliates, as well as $2.8 million of other third party fees and expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S6	Acquisition and transaction related expense of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $17.8 million for the purchase of seven properties during the period, partially offset by a reimbursement by the Advisor of $2.5 million for expenses and legal reimbursements paid on previous acquisitions.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S7	Vesting of Asset Management Fees Vesting of asset management fees expense of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the vesting of Class B units previously issued to the Advisor for asset management services.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S8	The performance condition related to these Class B units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S9	On April 15, 2014, the Class B units were converted to OP units on a one-to-one basis.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S10	Value of Listing Note Value of listing promote expense of $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 represented the final value of the Listing Note.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P47_S11	See Note 9 Subordinated Listing Distribution of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $11.3 million to $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily related to an increase in equity-based compensation and professional fees to support our larger real estate portfolio and operations as a traded REIT subsequent to Listing.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	At the time the IPO ended in December 2013, we began to expense, as incurred, professional fees relating to stockholder services, because these costs no longer related to fulfilling subscriptions and offering costs.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	General and administrative expenses included equity-based compensation expense of $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 consisting of the amortization of the fair value of the OPP, which was adopted in conjunction with the Listing and board member equity-based compensation.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	Prior to the Listing, board member equity-based compensation was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S4	Additionally, the Advisor elected to absorb $1.4 million and $1.5 million , respectively, of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S5	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense increased $53.0 million to $84.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to $31.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S6	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense related mainly to our 2013/2014 Acquisitions, which resulted in additional expense of $55.1 million as well as $0.6 million related to the acceleration of depreciation on tenant improvements as a result of a partial lease termination and modification at 229 West 36th Street.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S7	The increase was partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense relating to prior period tenant lease expirations and terminations, net of additional depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S8	Interest Expense Interest expense increased $13.0 million to $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 partly as a result of a higher weighted average balance outstanding on our Credit Facility of $439.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to $63.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 , as well as the associated increased amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from expanding our Credit Facility.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S9	Additionally, we expensed $3.6 million of financing costs during the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of amendments to our Credit Facility.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S10	Loss from Unconsolidated Joint Venture Loss from unconsolidated joint venture was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , which represents our preferred distribution, net of our pro rata share of the net loss of Worldwide Plaza and the amortization of the difference in basis between our investment and the book value of Worldwide Plaza's net assets, which we acquired in October 2013.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S11	During our period of ownership from October 31, 2013 to December 31, 2013, we had loss from unconsolidated joint venture of $0.1 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S12	Income from Preferred Equity Investment, Investment Securities and Interest Income from preferred equity investment, investment securities and interest increased $2.2 million to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which primarily represents income earned on our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street, acquired in October 2013, and our investments in redeemable preferred stock and equity securities.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S13	The net loss attributable to non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $1.3 million and approximately $32,000 , respectively, which represents the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests for the period.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P48_S14	The increase in net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was primarily driven by the increase in OP units resulting from the Listing, including the vesting of Class B units which were converted to OP units as well as the settlement of the Listing Note and subsequent conversion to OP units.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 For the year ended December 31, 2015 , net cash provided by operating activities was $37.7 million , which represents an increase of $31.2 million over the $6.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase is primarily a result of strong leasing activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2015 and contractual rent escalations within our existing leases.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	The increase in cash provided by operating activities also related to a lower amount of prepaid expenses and other assets as well as accounts payable and accrued expenses that were relatively unchanged year-over-year, as opposed to the large cash outflow experienced in 2014 for the payment of prior year accrued capital expenditures (see below the discussion of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 ).
1474464_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	Notwithstanding a net loss of $40.3 million , net cash provided by operating activities included adjustments for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, equity-based compensation and other non-cash charges of $88.0 million , which resulted in cash inflows of $47.7 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	Net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an increase in accrued ground rent of $3.2 million , which results from recording rental expenses on a straight-line basis, a decrease in tenant and other receivables of $1.0 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.3 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P50_S3	These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in unbilled rent receivables of $13.7 million recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis, a decrease in deferred rent of $0.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.1 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $61.9 million primarily related to our 2015 Disposition as well and the redemption of our preferred equity investment of $70.9 million , distributions received from our investment in Worldwide Plaza of $12.1 million , acquisition funds released from escrow of $4.7 million and proceeds from the sale of investment securities of $4.6 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	These cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures for building and tenant improvements of $30.3 million and the purchase of investment securities of $0.1 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Net cash used in financing activities of $23.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to repayments on our Credit Facility of $150.0 million , regularly scheduled principal payments on mortgage notes payable as well as full repayments of four mortgage notes payable and settlements through legal defeasance of two mortgage notes payable before the scheduled maturity dates of $88.8 million to facilitate including the underlying properties in the borrowing base of our Credit Facility in connection with a series of debt restructuring transactions we undertook at the end of the third quarter of 2015, dividends to common stockholders of $74.7 million , payments of financing costs of $10.8 million and payments of $0.5 million to secure interest rate caps for our mortgage notes payable on 1440 Broadway.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Net cash used in financing activities also included $3.2 million of distributions to non-controlling interests such as OP unit and participating LTIP unit holders as well as the repayment of our non-controlling partner related to our 2015 Disposition.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from mortgage notes payable of $305.0 million secured by 1440 Broadway.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S5	Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2014 , net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S6	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S7	Cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 included $16.1 million of transaction costs relating to the Listing and the acquisition of 245-249 West 17th Street.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S8	Cash flows provided by operating activities included a net loss adjusted for non-cash items, resulting in a cash inflow of $43.4 million (net loss of $94.3 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets and other non-cash charges of $137.7 million ) and an increase in accrued ground rent of $4.3 million , which resulted from recording rental expenses on a straight-line basis.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P51_S9	These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in unbilled rent receivables of $19.6 million recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.7 million , primarily due to payments of prior year accrued tenant improvements at our 50 Varick Street property and fees paid to our Former Dealer Manager for services rendered in 2013 related to exploring our liquidity event, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $6.6 million , primarily due to prepaid real estate taxes, insurance and deferred leasing costs, a decrease in deferred rent of $3.4 million and an increase in tenant and other receivables of $2.8 million , primarily due to amounts related to our preferred equity investment and other tenant receivables.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $327.8 million primarily related to $316.2 million for the acquisition of 245-249 W 17th Street, acquisition funds held in escrow of $4.7 million , $11.8 million of capital expenditures and $3.1 million in purchases of additional investment securities.

1474464_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	This section includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations, Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income, Cash Net Operating Income and Adjusted Cash Net Operating Income.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), is provided below.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( FFO ), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure but is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards set forth in the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the White Paper ).
1474464_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, but excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time, especially if not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss).
1474464_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	However, FFO, core funds from operations ("Core FFO") and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO ), as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P59_S4	In calculating FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition (as we do) or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do and/or calculate Core FFO and/or AFFO differently than we do.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P59_S5	Consequently, our presentation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	We consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Because FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs in our peer group.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Core FFO is FFO, excluding acquisition and transaction related costs and other costs that are considered to be not "core" to our business and comparable from period to period, such as gains on sales of securities and investments, miscellaneous revenue, gains, losses and expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt and other non-core expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, has been a key operational feature of our business.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	In evaluating investments in real estate, we differentiate the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction related costs and non-core revenues and expenses, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S2	We exclude certain income or expense items from AFFO that we consider more reflective of investing activities, other non-cash income and expense items and the income and expense effects of other activities that are not a fundamental attribute of our business plan.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S3	These items include unrealized gains and losses, which may not ultimately be realized, such as gains or losses on derivative instruments and gains or losses on contingent valuation rights.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S4	We also exclude distributions on Class B units as the related shares are assumed to have converted to common stock in our calculation of fully diluted weighted average shares of common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S5	In addition, by excluding non-cash income and expense items such as equity-based compensation expenses, amortization of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs and straight-line rent from AFFO, we believe we provide useful information regarding income and expense items which have no cash impact and do not provide liquidity to the company or require capital resources of the company.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S6	Similarly, we include items such as free rent credits paid by sellers in our calculation of AFFO because these funds are paid to us during the free rent period and therefore impact our liquidity.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S7	By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance without the impacts of transactions that are not related to the ongoing profitability of our portfolio of properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S8	We also believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P64_S9	Investors are cautioned that AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as it excludes certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	In calculating AFFO, we exclude certain expenses, which under GAAP are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore impact our liquidity.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S2	All paid and accrued merger, acquisition and transaction related fees and certain other expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred or properties are acquired will also have negative effects on returns to investors, the ability to fund dividends or distributions in the future, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property and certain other expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S3	AFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to companies that did not have such activities.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S4	Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S5	In addition, we view fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S6	We view both gains and losses from fair value adjustments as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S7	Excluding income and expense items detailed above from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S8	Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S9	By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P65_S10	As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	The table below reflects the items deducted from or added to net loss in our calculation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO during the period presented.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P66_S1	We have calculated our FFO, Core FFO and AFFO based on our net loss, which is before adjusting for the net loss (income) attributable to our non-controlling interests, and all adjustments are made based on our gross adjustments, without excluding the portion of the adjustments attributable to our non-controlling interests, other than adjustments related to the unconsolidated joint venture.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	___________________________ (1) During the fourth quarter of 2015, we identified certain immaterial errors impacting interest expense in our previously issued quarterly financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	Interest expense and net loss were understated by $0.3 million for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	Quarterly amounts in the table above have been revised to reflect the corrected amounts.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P67_S3	(2) During the fourth quarter of 2015, we reclassified the write-off of a terminated below-market lease from depreciation and amortization expense to revenue, which impacted the first quarter of 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P67_S4	Depreciation and amortization for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 has been revised to reflect this reclassification.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P67_S5	The impact of the below-market lease write-off was deemed to be non-core to our business and is now being included in the reconciliation to Core FFO.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	(3) Proportionate share of depreciation and amortization related to unconsolidated joint venture and amortization of difference in basis.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	(4) Acquisition and transaction-related expenses for the third quarter of 2015 primarily represent costs associated with mortgage payoffs and our Credit Facility amendment.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	For the fourth quarter of 2015, these costs are primarily related to litigation at Worldwide Plaza and professional fees related to the exploration of strategic transactions.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	(5) Represents our estimate of non-core audit fees.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	(6) Represents deferred financing costs that were written off as a result of paying off mortgages in advance of their scheduled maturity dates.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P68_S5	During the second quarter of 2015, we excluded equity-based compensation from our calculation of Core FFO for the first time.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P68_S6	During the third quarter of 2015, we reverted to our previous practice of excluding the impact of non-cash compensation expense from the reconciliation to Core FFO to the reconciliation to AFFO for all periods presented.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income, Cash Net Operating Income and Adjusted Cash Net Operating Income.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	We believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related expenses, other non-cash items and including our pro rata share from unconsolidated joint ventures ("Adjusted EBITDA") is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and service debt.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating activities.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P70_S2	Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that of other REITs.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Net operating income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less discontinued operations, interest, other income and income from preferred equity investments and investments securities, plus corporate general and administrative expense, acquisition and transaction-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P71_S1	NOI is adjusted to include our pro rata share of NOI from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P71_S2	Cash NOI is NOI presented on a cash basis, which is NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-lining of rent and the amortization of above and below market leases.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P71_S3	Adjusted Cash NOI is Cash NOI after eliminating the effects of free rent.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P71_S4	We use NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI internally as performance measures and believe NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P71_S5	Therefore, we believe NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI are useful measures for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P71_S6	Further, we believe NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI are useful to investors as performance measures because, when compared across periods, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI reflect the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unlevered basis.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI exclude certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P72_S1	For example, interest expense is not linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and Cash NOI is not affected by whether the financing is at the property level or corporate level.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P72_S2	In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI differently.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P73_S2	NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The table below reflects the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI during the period presented.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	We have calculated our Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI based on our net loss, which is before adjusting for the net loss (income) attributable to our non-controlling interests, and all adjustments are made based on our gross adjustments, without excluding the portion of the adjustments attributable to our non-controlling interests, other than adjustments related to the unconsolidated joint venture as noted in the table below.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	_________________ (1) During the fourth quarter of 2015, we reclassified the write-off of a terminated below-market lease from depreciation and amortization expense to revenue, which impacted the first quarter of 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	Depreciation and amortization for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and amortization of above/below market lease assets and liabilities have been revised to reflect this reclassification.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	(2) During the fourth quarter of 2015, we identified certain immaterial errors impacting interest expense in our previously issued quarterly financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Interest expense and net loss were understated by $0.3 million for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	Quarterly amounts in the table above have been revised to reflect the corrected amounts.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	(3) Proportionate share of adjustments related to unconsolidated joint venture and amortization of difference in basis.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2015 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $98.6 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	In the normal course of business, our principal demands for funds are to pay or fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, dividends and distributions to our stockholders and OP unit and LTIP unitholders, and principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	We have met these demands primarily through cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility, preferred distributions from Worldwide Plaza and the sale or redemption of certain assets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S3	Future sources of capital could also include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S4	Our principal sources and uses of funds are further described below.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S5	Our cash flows from operating activities is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs, including general and administrative expenses.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S6	We expect to continue to increase the amount of cash flow generated from operating activities in future periods through additional stabilization of our current investment portfolio.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P78_S7	Furthermore, we anticipate increased cash flow through future leasing activity and the contractual rent escalations included in a majority of our current leases during the primary term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	Availability of Funds from Credit Facility On April 14, 2014, we entered into our Credit Facility with Capital One.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	The Credit Facility allows for total borrowings of up to $705.0 million with a $305.0 million term loan and a $400.0 million revolving loan which mature on August 20, 2018 and August 20, 2016, respectively.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P79_S2	We have two one-year options to extend the revolving loan to August 20, 2018 subject to customary conditions and fees, which we intend to exercise.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	The Credit Facility contains an "accordion feature" to allow us, under certain circumstances, and with consent of our lenders, to increase the aggregate loan borrowings to up to $1.0 billion of total borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	The actual availability of borrowings under our Credit Facility for any period is based on requirements outlined in our Credit Facility with respect to the pool of eligible unencumbered assets that comprise our borrowing base properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	The unused borrowing capacity, based on the debt service coverage ratio of the borrowing base properties as of December 31, 2015 , was $63.0 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S3	On August 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment pursuant to which certain changes were made under the Credit Facility primarily to increase the borrowing base capacity including, among other changes, (i) the ability to add the Viceroy Hotel as a borrowing base asset, (ii) reducing the debt service coverage ratio test from 1.4 to 1.3 for draw downs on the Credit Facility, (iii) increasing the amount of dividends we are permitted to pay relative to our Modified Funds From Operations (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the twelve months commencing June 30, 2015 from 95% to 100%, and (iv) increasing the amount we can spend to repurchase shares of common stock during a fiscal year from $65.0 million to $100.0 million.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S4	We repaid $150.0 million in advances on the revolving portion of our Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S5	As of December 31, 2015 , the outstanding balance of the term loan and revolving components of the Credit Facility was $305.0 million and $180.0 million , respectively, with a combined weighted average interest rate of 2.4% .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S6	The Credit Facility requires interest only payments, with all principal outstanding being due on the maturity dates.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S7	The Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P80_S8	In the event of a default, the lenders have the right to terminate their obligations under the Credit Facility and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	The Credit Facility requires us to meet certain financial and non-financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S1	We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S2	We continuously monitor our compliance with all covenants.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S3	Certain covenants may restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under the Credit Facility or alternative sources of capital, such as the minimum debt service coverage ratio that we must maintain.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S4	We view a mix of secured and unsecured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage our working capital needs.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S5	Our interest expense in future periods will vary based, in part, on our level of future borrowings and the cost of these borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S6	Strategic Alternatives As previously disclosed, on October 1, 2015, we announced that we have retained the Eastdil Secured division of Wells Fargo Securities as strategic advisor to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions at the entity or asset level.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P81_S7	Our board continues to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	Initiatives to Increase Liquidity and Create Long-Term Value for our Stockholders During the second quarter of 2015, we announced several initiatives designed to increase our liquidity and create long-term value for our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	These initiatives include 1) increasing Cash NOI by leasing currently vacant space, stabilizing revenue at the Viceroy Hotel and releasing currently below-market expiring space at market rates; 2) considering joint venture partners in our top five assets to unlock excess value; 3) exploring the sale of five non-core assets in the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of New York City; and 4) realizing internal growth opportunities by repositioning office and basement space to retail space at 1440 Broadway as well as converting the lobby to rentable retail space.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we signed five new leases for our pro rata share of 125,727 rentable square feet which, on a weighted-average basis, increased initial cash rents by 23% over prior escalated rents.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	We continue to market our vacant spaces at 256 W. 38th Street, 229 W. 36th Street, 350 Bleecker Street and 1440 Broadway.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S4	During the fourth quarter of 2015, we sold one of our five non-core assets, 163 Washington Avenue in Brooklyn, New York for $37.7 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S5	We also entered into agreements of purchase and sale on our Duane Reade, 1623 Kings Highway and Foot Locker properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S6	The sales of Duane Reade and 1623 Kings Highway closed in February 2016 for contract sales prices of $12.6 million and $17.0 million , respectively, exclusive of closing costs.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S7	At closing, we repaid the mortgage notes payable securing Duane Reade and 1623 Kings Highway of $8.4 million and $7.3 million , respectively.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S8	We continue to explore the sale of our property located at 1100 Kings Highway in Brooklyn, New York and to focus on our retail repositioning efforts at 1440 Broadway.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S9	Other Sources of Funds On March 27, 2015, the owner of 123 William Street, the property in which we held our $35.1 million preferred equity investment, sold the property to ARC NYCR, which is advised by entities under common control with our Advisor.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S10	The sponsor of ARC NYCR is also our Sponsor.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S11	On that date, we received the entire principal balance plus accrued and unpaid income.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S12	Cash received from the sale of our preferred equity investment has increased our liquidity and the funds available for dividends to our stockholders and other working capital requirements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S13	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we received $12.1 million in preferred distributions from our investment in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S14	We expect to continue to receive cash distributions from Worldwide Plaza in accordance with our investment agreement.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S15	During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained a mortgage note payable of up to $325.0 million , secured by our property located at 1440 Broadway.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S16	As of December 31, 2015 , the mortgage note payable outstanding was $305.0 million , and up to $20.0 million is available in the future as additional advances, subject to customary funding conditions to pay, among other things, for certain tenant allowances, capital expenditures and leasing costs that have been approved by the lender.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S17	Principal Use of Funds Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 22 properties.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S18	In connection with the leasing of our properties, we have entered into and will continue to enter into agreements with our tenants to provide allowances for tenant improvements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S19	These allowances require us to fund capital expenditures up to amounts specified in our lease agreements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S20	We intend to fund tenant improvement allowances with cash on hand and cash flows from operations.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S21	Repurchase of Common Stock On June 22, 2015, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our common stock.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S22	We may opportunistically repurchase shares during periods of favorable market conditions to increase stockholder value.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S23	Any repurchases made in the future would be funded with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and excess cash from the sale of non-core assets.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S24	As of December 31, 2015 , we had not repurchased any shares pursuant to this initiative.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S25	Worldwide Plaza Option We expect to exercise our purchase option, which will be in the amount of $1.4 billion less the amount of mortgage debt outstanding, for the remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza during the option exercise period commencing in January 2017 and fund the purchase option using cash on hand and future mortgage financing secured by Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S26	Failure to exercise this option will subject us to a fee equal to $25.0 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S27	In addition, the loan securing Worldwide Plaza includes provisions which could restrict our exercise of the option unless we prepay the loan or meet certain tests, including net worth tests.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P82_S28	While we believe we currently meet such tests, there can be no assurance that we will meet them at the time that we desire to exercise the option.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Joint Ventures with ARC NYCR On October 1, 2015, we announced that we intend to enter into joint venture agreements with ARC NYCR, which is intended to better align interests between us and ARC NYCR and to facilitate the continued growth and diversification of both portfolios with reduced need to raise additional equity capital.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	Any joint venture agreement will require approval by our board of directors and the board of directors of ARC NYCR.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P83_S2	We have suspended efforts to form a joint venture agreement with ARC NYCR due to our ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	Dividends We are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we declared and paid a dividend rate equal to $0.46 per share per annum.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	Payments were made to stockholders of record at the close of business on the 8th day of each month, and payable on the 15th day of such month.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P84_S3	For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, amounts paid to our stockholders may be a return of capital and not a return on a stockholder's investment.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , dividends paid totaled $77.3 million , inclusive of $2.6 million of distributions paid on OP units and participating LTIP units.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , cash used to pay our dividends was primarily generated from cash flows provided by operations, proceeds from the return of our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street and proceeds from Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P85_S2	We expect to fund dividend payments over the next twelve months primarily from cash flows from operations, distributions in respect of our interest in Worldwide Plaza, the proceeds received from the investment securities we sold during the year ended December 31, 2015 and proceeds from the sale of non-core assets, two of which occurred during the first quarter of 2016.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P85_S3	The following table shows the sources for the payment of dividends for the periods presented:
1474464_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	__________________ (1) Includes distributions on OP units and participating LTIP units but excludes distributions paid to our non-controlling partner in 163 Washington Avenue as a result of the sale of the property in October 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	(2) During the fourth quarter of 2015, we identified certain immaterial errors impacting interest expense in our previously issued quarterly financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	Interest expense and net loss were understated by $0.3 million for each of the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P86_S3	Quarterly amounts in the table above have been revised to reflect the corrected amounts.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Future dividend payments are dependent on the availability of funds.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	Our board of directors may reduce the amount of dividends or distributions paid or suspend dividend payments at any time and therefore dividend payments are not assured.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S2	We have not generated and may not in the future generate operating cash flows sufficient to continue to pay dividends to our stockholders at the current rate.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S3	We have in the past been, and may again in the future be, required to borrow funds to fund dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S4	During 2016, we do not expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations to pay dividends at our current rate.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S5	We expect to be able to pay dividends from a combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S6	Actual cash available for dividends may vary substantially from our estimates.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S7	If our cash flow from operations and cash on hand are not sufficient, we may need to borrow funds, potentially at higher rates, or depend on our Advisor or our Property Manager to waive fees or reimbursement of certain expenses, which they are not required to do, to fund our operations and any dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S8	There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain funds from such sources, or pay or maintain our current level of dividends.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S9	As of December 31, 2015 , we had consolidated mortgage notes payable of $388.4 million , excluding $427.9 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt relating to our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's total mortgage debt of $875.0 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S10	As of December 31, 2015 , the consolidated mortgage notes payable had a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% and our pro rata share of unconsolidated mortgage debt relating to Worldwide Plaza had a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% .
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S11	The payment terms of our mortgage loan obligations require principal and interest amounts payable monthly and our Credit Facility is interest-only with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S12	Our loan agreements require us to comply with specific reporting covenants.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S13	As of December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S14	Our mortgage loans securing Foot Locker and Duane Reade are scheduled to mature in 2016.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S15	The mortgage loan securing Duane Reade was repaid in advance of its scheduled maturity date upon the sale of the property in February 2016.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S16	Foot Locker is currently under contract and we expect to repay that mortgage at closing of the sale of the property.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S17	The revolving portion of our Credit Facility is also scheduled to mature in 2016.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S18	We intend to exercise our two, one-year, extension options, which will extend the maturity date of the revolving portion of the Credit Facility to August 2018.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P87_S19	The following is a summary of our contractual debt obligations as of December 31, 2015 :
1474464_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Lease Obligations We entered into lease agreements with the owners of the ground leases at 350 Bleecker Street and the Viceroy Hotel.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P88_S1	The following table reflects the minimum base rental cash payments due from us over the next five years and thereafter under these arrangements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P88_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes, among other items.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	Election as a REIT We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S2	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S3	In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S4	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S5	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S6	Inflation Many of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S7	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S8	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S9	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P89_S10	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	Related-Party Transactions and Agreements We have entered into agreements with affiliates of our Sponsor, whereby we have paid or may in the future pay certain fees or reimbursements to our Advisor, its affiliates and entities under common control with our Advisor in connection with acquisition and financing activities, asset and property management services and reimbursement of operating and offering related costs.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	See Note 14 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report and "Item 13.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence" for a discussion of our various related party transactions.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	On February 1, 2016, we issued 2,515,406 shares of our common stock upon redemption of 2,515,406 OP units held by certain individuals who are members of the Advisor and Sponsor.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	On February 2, 2016 , we closed on the sale of our Duane Reade property and repaid the mortgage securing that property.
1474464_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	On February 17, 2016 , we closed on the sale of our property located at 1623 Kings Highway and repaid the mortgage securing that property.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate debt.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We had fixed-rate secured mortgage notes payable and fixed-rate loans under our Credit Facility, with an aggregate carrying value of $163.4 million and a fair value of $167.8 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the notes, but it has no impact on interest due on the notes.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2015 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $1.7 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S6	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $1.7 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2015 , our variable-rate debt had a carrying and fair value of $710.0 million .
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P0_S8	Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate debt affects interest expense incurred and cash flow.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2015 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate debt would increase or decrease our interest expense by $7.1 million annually.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2015 , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.
1474464_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1474464_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P14_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P14_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in an entity, it evaluates whether such interest is in a VIE.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (1) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P33_S2	If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	In business combinations, the Company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective estimated fair values.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P34_S3	The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P34_S4	The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P34_S5	The fair value of above- or below-market leases and ground leases is recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and the Company's estimate of the comparable fair market lease rate, measured over the remaining term of the lease, including any below market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P34_S10	The Company also considers information and other factors including: market conditions, the industry in which the tenant operates, characteristics of the real estate such as location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Disposals of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented; otherwise, the Company continues to report the results of these properties' operations within continuing operations.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	Properties that are intended to be sold will be designated as "held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company has three properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 .

1474464_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	Acquired above-market leases are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P40_S1	Acquired below-market leases are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P40_S2	Acquired above-market ground leases are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P40_S3	Acquired below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option period.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above- and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P41_S1	Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P41_S2	The following table provides the weighted-average remaining amortization and accretion periods as of December 31, 2015 , for intangible assets and liabilities and the projected amortization expense and adjustments to revenues for the next five years:

1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the asset for impairment.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S3	If such estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S4	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is based on the adjustment to estimated fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S5	Generally, the Company determines estimated fair value for properties held for sale based on the agreed-upon selling price of an asset.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S6	These assessments may result in the immediate recognition of an impairment loss, resulting in a reduction of net income (loss).
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S7	The Company recognized impairment charges of $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P43_S8	The Company was not required to recognize any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	Impairment of Equity Method Investments The Company monitors the value of its equity method investments for indicators of impairment.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	An impairment charge is recognized when the Company determines that a decline in the fair value of the investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P44_S2	The assessment of impairment is subjective and involves the application of significant assumptions and judgments about the Company's intent and ability to recover its investment given the nature and operations of the underlying investment.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P44_S3	The Company was not required to recognize any impairment charges related to equity method investments during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .

1474464_16_ITEM15_P46_S3	Although the Company bears risk to amounts in excess of those insured by the FDIC, it does not anticipate any losses as a result.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash primarily consists of maintenance, real estate tax, structural, and debt service reserves.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	Investment Securities The Company classifies its investments in debt or equity securities into one of three classes: held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, as applicable.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P48_S1	Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at amortized cost.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P48_S2	Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purposes of selling them in the near future are classified as trading securities.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P48_S3	Debt and equity securities not classified as trading securities or as held-to-maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a component of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	The Company evaluates its investments in securities for impairment or other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	The Company reviews each investment individually and assesses factors that may include (i) if the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its fair value, (ii) if there has been any change in the market as a whole or in the investee s market, (iii) if there are any plans to sell the investment in question or if the Company believes it may be forced to sell its investment, and (iv) if there have been any other factors that would indicate the possibility of the existence of an other-than-temporary impairment.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The fair value of the Company s investments in available-for-sale securities generally rise and fall based on current market conditions.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	If, after reviewing relevant factors surrounding an impaired security, the Company determines that it will not recover its full investment in an impaired security, the Company recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the period in which the other-than-temporary impairment is discovered, regardless of whether or not the Company plans to sell or believes it will be forced to sell the security in question.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P51_S2	The Company was not required to recognize any other-than-temporary impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 or 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture The Company accounts for its investment in unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting because the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control, the entity and is not considered to be the primary beneficiary.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P52_S1	This investment was recorded initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for equity in net income (loss) and cash contributions and distributions.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P52_S2	Any difference between the carrying amount of this investment and the underlying equity in net assets is depreciated and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint venture on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	Equity income (loss) from unconsolidated joint venture is allocated based on the Company's ownership or economic interest in the joint venture.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P53_S1	A loss in the value of a joint venture investment that is determined to be other than temporary is recognized in the period in which the loss occurs.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P53_S2	See Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	Deferred Costs, Net Deferred costs, net consists of deferred financing costs and leasing costs.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P54_S1	Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal fees, and other costs associated with obtaining commitments for financing.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P54_S2	These costs are amortized to interest expense over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the effective interest method.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P54_S3	Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P54_S4	Costs incurred in seeking financial transactions that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P54_S5	Deferred leasing costs, consisting primarily of lease commissions and professional fees incurred, are deferred and amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Derivative Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of its borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P55_S3	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or if the Company does not elect to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P57_S2	If the Company designates a qualifying derivative as a hedge, changes in the value of the derivative are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P57_S3	If a derivative does not qualify as a hedge, or if the Company does not elect to apply hedge accounting, changes in the value of the derivative are reflected in other income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company's revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P58_S1	Because many of the Company's leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, GAAP requires that the Company record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that it will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P58_S2	The Company defers the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P58_S3	When the Company acquires a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P59_S0	Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the leased space.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P59_S1	For the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P60_S0	To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, the Company evaluates whether the Company owns or if the tenant owns the tenant improvements.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	When the Company is the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is on the date on which such improvements are substantially complete.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	When the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P61_S2	When the Company concludes that it is the owner of tenant improvements, the Company capitalizes the cost to construct the tenant improvements, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P61_S3	When the Company concludes that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, the Company records its contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred leasing costs, net on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	The Company continually reviews receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determines collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, the Company will record an increase in its allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company owns certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, the Company defers the recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	If contingent rental income is recognized pursuant to these provisions, contingent rental income is included in rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P63_S3	The Company recognized contingent rental revenue of $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P63_S4	The Company did not recognize any revenue or deferred revenue related to contingent rental income during the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P65_S0	The Company's hotel revenues are recognized as earned and are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P65_S1	The Company has a stock-based incentive award plan for its directors, which is accounted for under the guidance for employee share based payments.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P65_S2	The cost of services received in exchange for a stock award is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and the expense for such awards is included in general and administrative expenses and is recognized over the service period or when the requirements for exercise of the award have been met.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P66_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company granted restricted shares to employees of the Advisor, which are accounted for under the guidance for non-employee share-based payments.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P66_S1	The fair value of the awards granted to employees of the Advisor are remeasured quarterly, with the resulting amortization adjustments reflected in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P67_S0	2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement On April 15, 2014 (the "Effective Date"), in connection with the Listing, the Company entered into the OPP with the OP and the Advisor, which is accounted for under the guidance for non-employee share-based payments.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P67_S1	The Company records equity based compensation expense associated with the awards over the requisite service period of five years.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P67_S2	Equity-based compensation expense is adjusted each reporting period for changes in the estimated market-related performance.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P67_S3	See Note 16 Share-Based Compensation .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	Income Taxes The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	If the Company continues to qualify for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent it distributes annually all of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders, determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P69_S0	REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that the Company distribute annually at least 90% of the Company s REIT taxable income to the Company s stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P69_S1	If the Company fails to continue to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) beginning with the year in which it fails to qualify and may be precluded from being able to elect to be treated as a REIT for the Company s four subsequent taxable years.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P69_S2	The Company distributed to its stockholders 100% of its REIT taxable income for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P69_S3	Accordingly, no provision for federal or state income taxes related to such REIT taxable income was recorded on the Company s financial statements.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P69_S4	Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P70_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company purchased a hotel, which is owned by a subsidiary of the OP and leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), that is owned by the OP.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P70_S1	A TRS is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P71_S0	The TRS is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P71_S1	The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent the Company believes these assets will more likely than not be realized.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P71_S2	In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P71_S3	In the event the Company determines that it would not be able to realize the deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, the Company establishes a valuation allowance which offsets the previously recognized income tax benefit.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S0	Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of the TRS for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S1	The TRS had deferred tax assets and a corresponding valuation allowance of $3.1 million and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S2	The TRS had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards as of December 31, 2015 of $6.7 million , which will expire through 2036.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S3	The Company estimated income tax relating to its TRS using a combined federal and state rate of approximately 43% for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S4	The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss carry forwards will not be utilized during the carry forward period and as such the Company has established a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S5	The Company had immaterial current and deferred federal and state income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S6	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had no material uncertain income tax positions.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P72_S7	The tax years subsequent to and including the year ended December 31, 2012 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P73_S0	The Company calculates basic income (loss) per share of common stock by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted-average shares of its common stock outstanding for the respective period.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P73_S1	Diluted income per share takes into account the effect of dilutive instruments such as unvested restricted stock, Long-term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") units and OP units (assuming such units are not antidilutive), based on the average share price for the period in determining the number of incremental shares that are to be added to the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P73_S2	See Note 18 Net Loss Per Share .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P74_S0	Reportable Segments The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment, with activities related to investing in real estate.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P75_S0	The Company's investments in real estate generate rental revenue and other income through the leasing and management of properties.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P75_S1	Management evaluates the operating performance of the Company's investments in real estate at the individual property level.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P76_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P76_S1	Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P76_S2	The revised guidance was to become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P76_S3	Early adoption was not permitted under GAAP.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P76_S4	The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P76_S5	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revised guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P76_S6	The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P77_S0	In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P77_S1	The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships).
1474464_16_ITEM15_P77_S2	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P78_S1	The guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P79_S1	The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P79_S2	In August 2015, the FASB added that, for line of credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P79_S3	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P79_S4	Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P79_S5	The revised guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued an update that eliminates the requirement to adjust provisional amounts from a business combination and the related impact on earnings by restating prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on current and prior periods, including the prior period impact on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items and their related tax effects, shall be recognized in the period the adjustment amount is determined.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P80_S2	The cumulative adjustment would be reflected within the respective financial statement line items affected.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P80_S3	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P80_S4	The Company elected to adopt the new guidance as of September 30, 2015.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P80_S5	The adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued an update that amends the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P81_S1	The new guidance significantly revises an entity s accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P81_S2	Among other things, it also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P81_S3	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P114_S0	Note 9 Subordinated Listing Distribution Upon occurrence of the Listing, New York Recovery Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the "SLP") became entitled to begin receiving distributions of net sale proceeds pursuant to its special limited partner interest in the OP (the "SLP Interest") in an aggregate amount that was evidenced by the issuance of a note by the OP (the "Listing Note").
1474464_16_ITEM15_P114_S1	The Listing Note was equal to 15.0% of the amount, if any, by which (a) the average market value of the Company s outstanding common stock for the period 180 days to 210 days after the Listing, plus dividends paid by the Company prior to the Listing, exceeded (b) the sum of the total amount of capital raised from stockholders during the Company s IPO and the amount of cash flow necessary to generate a 6.0% annual cumulative, non-compounded return to such stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P115_S0	Concurrently with the Listing, the Company, as general partner of the OP, caused the OP to enter into the Listing Note agreement dated April 15, 2014 by and between the OP and the SLP, and caused the OP to issue the Listing Note.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P115_S1	The Listing Note was evidence of the SLP's right to receive distributions of net sales proceeds from the sale of the Company's real estate and real estate-related assets up to an aggregate amount equal to the principal balance of the Listing Note.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P116_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the OP, the SLP had the right, but not the obligation, to convert all or a portion of the SLP interest into limited partnership units of the OP ("OP units"), which are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock or the cash value of a corresponding number of shares, at the election of the OP, in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P117_S0	The principal amount of the Listing Note was determined based, in part, on the actual market value of the Company s outstanding common stock for the period 180 days to 210 days after the Listing.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P117_S1	Until the final principal amount of the Listing Note was determined in November 2014, the Listing Note was considered to be a derivative which was marked to fair value at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P117_S2	The principal amount of the Listing Note was determined to be $33.5 million and was recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P117_S3	On November 21, 2014, at the request of the SLP, the Listing Note was converted into 3,062,512 OP units and the value of the Listing Note was reclassified from derivative liabilities to non-controlling interest on the consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P118_S0	Note 10 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company determines fair value of its financial instruments based on quoted prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality and duration of the instrument.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P118_S1	This alternative approach also reflects the contractual terms of the instruments, as applicable, including the period to maturity, and may use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities, and unobservable inputs, such as expected volatility.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P119_S0	The guidance defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P119_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P119_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P120_S0	The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P120_S1	In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P120_S2	Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives, such as interest rate swaps and caps, fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with those derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by the Company and its counterparties.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P120_S3	However, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the Company's derivatives.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P120_S4	As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P120_S5	See Note 11 Interest Rate Derivatives and Hedging Activities .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P121_S0	The valuation of derivatives is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P121_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P121_S2	In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated into the fair values to account for the Company's potential nonperformance risk and the performance risk of the counterparties.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P121_S3	The Company had investments in redeemable preferred stock and an equity security as of December 31, 2014 that were traded in active markets and therefore, due to the availability of quoted market prices in active markets, the Company classified these investments as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P121_S4	The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall:
1474464_16_ITEM15_P122_S0	A review of the fair value hierarchy classification is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P123_S0	Changes in the type of inputs may result in a reclassification for certain assets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P123_S1	There were no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P124_S0	Financial instruments not carried at fair value The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate the value.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P124_S1	The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and dividends payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets due to their short-term nature.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P124_S2	The fair values of the Company's financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are reported below.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P125_S0	The fair value of mortgage notes payable, the fixed-rate portions of term loans on the Credit Facility and the preferred equity investment are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on similar types of arrangements.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P126_S0	Advances under the Credit Facility with variable interest rates and advances under the revolving portion of the Credit Facility are considered to be reported at fair value.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P127_S0	Note 11 Interest Rate Derivatives and Hedging Activities Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, caps, collars, options, floors and other interest rate derivative contracts, to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P127_S1	The principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with the Company's operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P127_S2	The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative or purposes other than interest rate risk management.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P127_S3	The use of derivative financial instruments carries certain risks, including the risk that the counterparties to these contractual arrangements will not perform under the agreements.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P127_S4	To mitigate this risk, the Company only enters into derivative financial instruments with counterparties that the Company believes to have high credit ratings and with major financial institutions with which the Company and the Advisor and its affiliates may also have other financial relationships.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P127_S5	Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company's objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P127_S6	To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S1	Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates rise above the cap strike rate on the contract.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S2	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S3	The Company uses such derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company terminated two of its interest rate swaps as the related hedged debts were repaid, which made it probable that the forecasted transactions would not occur and, as a result, accelerated the reclassification of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S5	The accelerated amounts resulted in a loss of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , which is included in the gain (loss) on derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S6	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to derivatives are reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company's variable-rate debt.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P128_S7	During the next 12 months , the Company estimates that an additional $1.0 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an increase to interest expense.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P129_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P130_S0	Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company's exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks, but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements under GAAP.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P130_S1	Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings, which resulted in an expense of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 and included in gain (loss) on derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P130_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were not designated as hedges in qualified hedging relationships.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P144_S2	RXR appealed the ruling and, on October 13, 2015, the appellate court upheld the previous decisions; however, the appellate court held that the trial court's exclusion of lost profit damages was premature and would have to be considered through a motion for summary judgment.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P144_S4	Oral argument of the motion is scheduled for March 24, 2016.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P165_S3	Subsequent to the Listing, the Company amended the RSP to, among other things, remove the fixed amount of restricted shares that are automatically granted to the independent directors.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P165_S4	Under the amended RSP, the annual amount granted to the independent directors is determined by the board of directors.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P165_S5	Generally, such awards provide for accelerated vesting of (i) all unvested restricted shares upon a change in control or a termination without cause and (ii) the portion of the unvested restricted shares scheduled to vest in the year of voluntary termination or the failure to be re-elected to the board.

1474464_16_ITEM15_P170_S2	Under the OPP, the Advisor was issued 8,880,579 LTIP units in the OP with a maximum award value on the issuance date equal to 5.0% of the Company s market capitalization (the OPP Cap ).
1474464_16_ITEM15_P170_S3	The LTIP units are structured as profits interests in the OP.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P171_S0	The Advisor is eligible to earn a number of LTIP units with a value equal to a portion of the OPP Cap upon the first, second and third anniversaries of the Effective Date based on the Company s achievement of certain levels of total return to its stockholders ( Total Return ), including both share price appreciation and common stock dividends, as measured against a peer group of companies, as set forth below, for the three-year performance period commencing on the Effective Date (the Three-year Period each 12 -month period during the Three -Year Period (the One-Year Periods and the initial 24 -month period of the Three -Year Period (the Two-Year Period ), as follows:

1474464_16_ITEM15_P178_S0	The Peer Group is comprised of the companies in the SNL US REIT Office Index.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S0	The potential outperformance award is calculated at the end of each One-Year Period, the Two-Year Period and the Three-Year Period.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S1	The award earned for the Three-Year Period is based on the formula in the table above less any awards earned for the Two-Year Period and One-Year Periods, but not less than zero; the award earned for the Two-Year Period is based on the formula in the table above less any award earned for the first and second One-Year Period, but not less than zero.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S2	Any LTIP units that are unearned at the end of the Performance Period will be forfeited.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S3	On April 15, 2015, 367,059 LTIP units were earned by the Advisor under the terms of the OPP.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S4	Moreover, the OPP provides for early calculation of earned LTIP units and for the accelerated vesting of any earned LTIP units in the event the Advisor is terminated or in the event of a change in control of the Company, which could motivate the Advisor to recommend a transaction that would result in a change in control under the OPP when such a transaction would not otherwise be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S5	Subject to the Advisor s continued service through each vesting date, one third of any earned LTIP units will vest on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Effective Date.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S6	Until such time as an LTIP unit is earned in accordance with the provisions of the OPP, the holder of such LTIP unit is entitled to distributions on such LTIP unit equal to 10% of the distributions made per OP unit.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P179_S7	The Company paid $0.7 million and $0.3 million , respectively, in distributions related to LTIP units during the year s ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, which is included in non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P180_S0	After an LTIP unit is earned, the holder of such LTIP unit is entitled to a catch-up distribution and then the same distribution as the holder of an OP unit.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P180_S1	At the time the Advisor s average capital account balance with respect to an LTIP unit is economically equivalent to the average capital account balance of an OP unit, the LTIP unit has been earned and it has been vested for 30 days, the Advisor, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to convert such LTIP unit into an OP unit in accordance with the provisions of the limited partnership agreement of the OP.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P181_S0	Compensation expense related to the OPP was $14.1 million and $5.3 million , respectively, for the year s ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P182_S0	The valuation of the OPP is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P182_S1	This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the OPP, including the performance periods and total return hurdles, as well as observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, and unobservable inputs, such as expected volatility.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P182_S2	As a result, the Company has determined that its OPP valuation in its entirety is classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P182_S3	See Note 10 Fair Value of Financial Instruments .
1474464_16_ITEM15_P183_S0	The following table presents information about the Company's OPP, which is measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the instrument falls:
1474464_16_ITEM15_P184_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for the changes in instruments with Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy for the year ended December 31, 2015 :
1474464_16_ITEM15_P185_S0	The following table provides quantitative information about significant Level 3 input used:
1474464_16_ITEM15_P186_S0	Expected volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P186_S1	Generally, the higher the expected volatility of the underlying instrument, the wider the range of potential future returns.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P186_S2	An increase in expected volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in the fair value measurement of an instrument.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P186_S3	For the relationship described above, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P187_S0	The following table illustrates the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of and for the periods indicated:

1474464_16_ITEM15_P189_S0	Diluted net loss per share assumes the conversion of all common share equivalents into an equivalent number of common shares, unless the effect is antidilutive.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P189_S1	The Company considers unvested restricted shares, OP units and LTIP units to be common share equivalents.
1474464_16_ITEM15_P189_S2	The Company had the following common share equivalents for the periods presented, which were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share attributable to stockholders as the effect would have been antidilutive:

1474464_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a New York City focused REIT that primarily owns income-producing commercial real estate.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	We were incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	We purchased our first property and commenced active operations in June 2010.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P0_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , we owned 19 properties, which aggregated 3.3 million rentable square feet, had an occupancy of 93.4% and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 8.9 years .
1474464_17_ITEM1_P0_S4	Our portfolio primarily consists of office and retail properties, representing 83% and 9% , respectively, of rentable square feet as of December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM1_P0_S5	We have acquired hotel and other types of real properties to add diversity to our portfolio.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P0_S6	Properties other than office and retail spaces represented 8% of rentable square feet.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Substantially all of our business is conducted through New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "OP").
1474464_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our only significant asset is the general partnership interests we own in the OP and assets held by us for the use and benefit of the OP.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	On August 22, 2016, our board of directors approved the Liquidation Plan, subject to stockholder approval.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	On January 3, 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders approved the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, we expect to sell or transfer all of our assets, pay or provide for our liabilities and expenses, distribute the remaining proceeds of the liquidation of our assets to our stockholders, wind up our operations and dissolve.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	The actual amounts and times of liquidating distributions to our stockholders pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will be determined by our board of directors at its discretion.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S4	We have retained the Advisor to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis through the Transition Date (as defined below) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (as amended to date, the Advisory Agreement ).
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S5	Until the Transition Date, New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") serves as our property manager, unless services are performed by a third party for specific properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S6	The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC).
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S7	In September 2016, our board of directors issued a request for proposals for all interested, qualified parties to serve as our external advisor after December 26, 2016, which was then the expiration date of the Advisory Agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S8	On December 19, 2016, we entered into an agreement (the Services Agreement ) with the Service Provider, and a series of other agreements with the Advisor and the Property Manager pursuant to which we: (i) amended the Advisory Agreement to provide that the Advisor will not be responsible for implementing the Liquidation Plan and to extend the term to March 31, 2017, subject to five one-month extension options that may be exercised by our independent directors, provided that, following the later of February 28, 2017 and the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Advisory Agreement may be terminated upon three business days written notice from our independent directors, (ii) amended our agreement with the Property Manager (as so amended, the "Property Management Agreement") so that it will terminate on the expiration or termination of the Advisory Agreement, and (iii) entered into the Services Agreement pursuant to which the Service Provider will serve as (x) our exclusive advisor with respect to all matters primarily related to the Liquidation Plan (and as a consultant to us on other matters) during the period from January 3, 2017 through the Transition Date, and (y) as our advisor from and after the Transition Date.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S9	The "Transition Date" will occur upon the earlier of (i) three business days after written notice from our independent directors to the Advisor, following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), but not earlier than March 3, 2017, and (ii) April 1, 2017.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S10	Prior to the Transition Date, the Advisor will continue to provide all services related to the management of our day-to-day operations that are not related to the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S11	Following the Transition Date, the Service Provider will be responsible for providing these services in addition to the services it has been providing since January 3, 2017 with respect to the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P2_S12	All services provided pursuant to the Advisory Agreement and the Services Agreement are subject to the supervision of our board of directors.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Liquidation Plan On January 3, 2017, our stockholders approved the Liquidation Plan, and we became fully authorized to commence implementing the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	The actual amounts and times of the liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will be determined by our board of directors or, if a liquidating trust is formed, by the trustees of the liquidating trust, in their discretion.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	The Liquidation Plan provides, in pertinent part, that, among other things:
1474464_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	We are authorized to sell all of our assets, liquidate and dissolve the Company and its subsidiaries, and distribute the net proceeds of such liquidation in accordance with the provisions of our charter, our bylaws and the laws of the State of Maryland.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	We will not engage in any business activities, except (i) to exercise the WWP Option, or (ii) to the extent otherwise necessary to preserve the value of our assets, wind up our business, pay or establish a reserve fund for our debts and distribute our assets to our stockholders, all in accordance with our charter and our bylaws, and the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	We are authorized to satisfy any existing contractual obligations (including any capital call requirements), pay for required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate properties (including real estate properties owned by joint ventures in which the Company owns an interest) if our board of directors so chooses and make protective acquisitions or advances with respect to our existing assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	We are authorized to provide for the payment of any and all claims and obligations of ours, including all contingent, conditional or contractual claims known to us.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	We may do so through the creation of a reserve fund or in other ways.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	All of our shares of common stock will be canceled and we will cease to exist upon the earlier of a final cash liquidating distribution or an in kind distribution of beneficial interests in a liquidating trust.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	If we cannot sell our assets and pay our debts by January 3, 2019, which is 24 months from the date our stockholders approved the Liquidation Plan, we intend, for tax purposes, to transfer and assign our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	This would be necessary in order for us, assuming we remain qualified as a REIT, to be eligible to deduct amounts distributed pursuant to the Liquidation Plan as dividends paid and thereby meet our annual distribution requirement and not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such amounts.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Upon transfer and assignment, our stockholders will receive beneficial interests in the liquidating trust equivalent to our stockholders ownership interests in the Company as represented by the shares of our common stock held by our stockholders prior to the transfer and assignment.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	The liquidating trust will pay or provide for all of our liabilities and distribute any remaining net proceeds from the sale of its assets to the holders of beneficial interests in the liquidating trust.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The transfer of our assets to a liquidating trust is a taxable event to our stockholders notwithstanding that our stockholders may not currently receive a distribution of cash or any other assets with which to satisfy the resulting tax liability.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our stockholders interests in a liquidating trust will be generally non-transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Until we are dissolved, our board of directors may terminate the Liquidation Plan without stockholder approval only (i) if our board of directors approves the Company entering into an agreement involving the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or common stock by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale or other transaction involving the Company or (ii) if our board of directors determines, in exercise of its duties under Maryland law, after consultation with its advisor and its financial advisor (if applicable) or other third party experts familiar with the market for Manhattan office properties, that there is an adverse change in the market for Manhattan office properties that reasonably would be expected to adversely affect proceeding with the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	Notwithstanding approval of the Liquidation Plan by our stockholders, our board of directors may amend the Liquidation Plan without further action by our stockholders to the extent permitted under then current law.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Assets All of our assets are located in New York City and were acquired between 2010 and 2014.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	The following table presents information about the property type and geographic diversity of the properties we owned as of December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	The amounts shown in the table below include our proportionate share of our investment in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	See Note 4 Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture to our audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our investment in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	________________________________ (2) Excludes 15,055 square foot parking garage at 416 Washington Street, which is being operated under a management agreement with a third party.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	The following table lists the tenants whose annualized cash rent represented greater than 10% of our total annualized cash rent for all portfolio properties as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively:
1474464_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	________________________ (1) Annualized cash rent reflects our 48.9% pro rata share of rent generated by Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	The termination, delinquency or non-renewal of any of the above tenants would have a material adverse effect on our revenues.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P14_S2	No other tenant represents more than 10% of our annualized cash rent for the periods presented.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P14_S3	Indebtedness As of December 31, 2016, we had combined debt of $1.6 billion , including the POL Loans described below and $427.9 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt reflecting our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's total mortgage debt of $875.0 million , with a weighted average interest rate equal to 4.3% per annum and a weighted average term to maturity of 2.8 years.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P14_S4	Approximately $810.2 million of this debt matures prior to January 3, 2019, the 24-month anniversary of stockholder approval of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P14_S5	As of December 31, 2016, our combined debt to enterprise value was 48% based on the closing price of our common stock of $10.12 per share and fully diluted shares of common stock outstanding of 168.7 million .
1474464_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	On December 20, 2016, we entered into a mortgage loan (the "Mortgage Loan") in the aggregate amount of $500.0 million and a mezzanine loan (the Mezzanine Loan and, together with the Mortgage Loan, the POL Loans ) in the aggregate amount of $260.0 million .
1474464_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Borrowings under the Mortgage Loan are secured by a mortgage on real properties (or ground lease or master lease) located in New York, New York at 245-249 West 17th Street, 333 West 34th Street, 216-218 West 18th Street, 50 Varick Street, 229 West 36th Street, 122 Greenwich Street, 350 West 42nd Street, 382-384 Bleecker Street, 350 Bleecker Street, 416-425 Washington Street, 33 West 56th Street and 120 West 57th Street (the "POL Loan Properties").
1474464_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	A portion of the net proceeds of the POL Loans after closing costs was used: (i) to repay the $485.0 million principal amount then outstanding under our revolving credit and term loan facility with Capital One, National Association (the Credit Facility and (ii) to deposit $260.0 million in an operating account that may be used by the Company to purchase the additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza upon exercise of the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Prior to the repayment in full of the Credit Facility, all of the POL Loan Properties were included as part of the borrowing base under the Credit Facility.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	We will be unable to pay liquidating distributions until we repay the release amounts required to be paid upon sales of POL Loan Properties under the POL Loans, which may delay the timing of liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are generally not permitted to engage in any business activities while implementing the Liquidation Plan, except to exercise the WWP Option to purchase additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza, pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	The purchase price required to exercise the WWP Option equals the product of the percentage interest being acquired and the agreed-upon property value of approximately $1.4 billion (subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments for any of our preferred return in arrears) minus the principal balance of the outstanding mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property, which was $875.0 million as of December 31, 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	We have the right to exercise the WWP Option by giving notice to our joint venture partner and making a $30.0 million deposit at any time during the period commencing January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, and we intend to exercise the WWP Option during this period with respect to all the equity interests in Worldwide Plaza, subject to our joint venture partner s right to retain up to 1.2% of our joint venture partner s membership interest.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	In accordance with the terms of the WWP Option, the closing of any purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza would occur between 30 and 90 days after we give notice of our exercise of the WWP Option, subject to extension for up to 60 days if necessary to satisfy the loan assumption conditions described below.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S4	The Worldwide Plaza property would remain subject to the mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property in connection with any purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza pursuant to our exercise of the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S5	In order to keep the mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property in place, we must satisfy certain loan assumption conditions, including meeting a minimum net worth requirement of $750.0 million and a minimum value of real estate assets controlled (through ownership or management) requirement of $2.0 billion (exclusive of our interest in the Worldwide Plaza property and cash).
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S6	While we believe we currently meet such tests, there can be no assurance that we will meet them at the time that we desire to exercise the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S7	If we do not exercise the WWP Option, we will be subject to a fee in the amount of $25.0 million .
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S8	We expect to fund the estimated $270.0 million in cash required at the closing of our purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza primarily with proceeds from the POL Loans and cash on hand.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S9	We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S10	We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S11	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner during our liquidation process, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S12	Despite having adopted the Liquidation Plan, in order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, continue to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements until we have completely liquidated.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S13	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P18_S14	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	Competition The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property's design to prospective tenants' needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do which could limit our success when we compete with them directly.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Service Provider for tenants.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from other properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Regulations Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P21_S4	However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The employees of the Advisor, the Service Provider and their affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including property management, accounting, legal, asset management and investor relations services.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset dispositions, asset and property management and other general administrative responsibilities.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Financial Information About Industry Segments All of our consolidated revenues are from our consolidated real estate properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	We internally evaluate operating performance on an individual property level and view all of our real estate assets as one industry segment; accordingly, all of our properties are aggregated into one reportable segment.
1474464_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	See our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 for our revenues from tenants, net income or loss, total assets and other financial information.

1474464_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Risks Related to The Liquidation Plan We cannot assure you of the actual amount you will receive in liquidating distributions pursuant to the Liquidation Plan or when you will receive them.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The net proceeds of the Liquidation Plan will be distributed to stockholders over time in one or more liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The actual amount that we will distribute to you in the liquidation will depend upon the actual amount of our liabilities, the actual proceeds from the sale of our properties, the actual fees and expenses incurred in connection with the sale of our properties, the actual expenses incurred in the administration of our properties prior to disposition, our actual general and administrative expenses, including fees and expense reimbursements paid to the Service Provider and its affiliates and other liabilities that may be incurred by us, our ability to continue to meet the requirements necessary to retain our status as a REIT throughout the liquidation process, our ability to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes throughout the period of the liquidation process and other factors.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If our liabilities (including, without limitation, tax liabilities and compliance costs) are greater than we currently expect or if the sales prices of our assets are less than we expect, you will receive less in total liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, we are seeking to sell most or all of our assets and to pay most or all of the liquidating distributions within 12 to 15 months of the Transition Date, although there is no assurance that sales or distributions will be made within that time period.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	We will be unable to pay liquidating distributions until we repay the release amounts required to be paid upon property sales under the POL Loans, which may delay the timing of liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Additionally, our board of directors has discretion as to the timing of distributions of net sales proceeds.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	While we have previously provided estimates about the timing and amount of liquidating distributions that we will make, these estimates are based on multiple assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect, and the actual amount of liquidating distributions we pay to you may be more or less than these estimates.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	We cannot assure you of the actual amount you will receive in liquidating distributions pursuant to the Liquidation Plan or when they will be paid.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	If we are unable to find buyers for our assets on a timely basis or at our expected sales prices, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, none of our assets are subject to a binding sale agreement providing for their sale.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The sales prices that we will ultimately be able to obtain for our assets are subject to many variables.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	For example, in order to find buyers in a timely manner, we may be required to lower our asking price below the low end of our current estimate of the asset s market value.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If we are not able to find buyers for these assets in a timely manner or if we have overestimated the sales prices we will receive, our liquidating distributions to our stockholders would be delayed or reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Furthermore, real estate sales prices are constantly changing and fluctuate with changes in interest rates, supply and demand dynamics, occupancy percentages, lease rates, the availability of suitable buyers, the perceived quality and dependability of income flows from tenants and a number of other factors, both local and national.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our liquidation proceeds may also be affected by the terms of prepayment or assumption costs associated with debt encumbering our real estate assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	In addition, the amount of transactional fees and expenses or unknown liabilities, if any, may adversely impact the net liquidation proceeds from our assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We may require additional capital to implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In December 2016, we entered into the POL Loans to repay the Credit Facility in full and provide $260.0 million in additional capital to exercise the WWP Option, which we have the right to do at any time until June 30, 2017.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	It is possible we may require additional funds for other capital needs including capital expenditures, working capital and other expenses related to our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P4_S3	There is no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to implement the Liquidation Plan effectively.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we need additional capital, we are unlikely to be able to access the capital markets and any failure to obtain financing to meet our capital needs, on favorable terms or at all, could reduce and delay the liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The existing loans encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property include provisions which could restrict our ability to assume those loans without lender consent upon exercise of the WWP Option and indirectly could limit our ability to sell assets prior to exercising the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In order to keep the existing mortgage and mezzanine loans encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property in place following exercise of the WWP Option without lender consent, certain loan assumption conditions must be met, including meeting a minimum net worth requirement of $750.0 million and a minimum value of real estate assets controlled (through ownership or management) requirement of $2.0 billion (exclusive of our interest in the Worldwide Plaza property and cash).
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Selling some of our assets prior to exercising the WWP Option could result in our failing to meet the requirement as to real estate assets controlled.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, even if we do not sell assets, there can be no assurance that we will meet these requirements at the time that we desire to exercise the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Repayment of the existing loans encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property would result in a substantial defeasance cost, which we estimate would be approximately $122.0 million as of February 1, 2017, and, to the extent we do not meet the loan assumption conditions, we may not be able to obtain lender consent to any assumption on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	These provisions and circumstances, as well as other restrictions in the loan agreements related to the Worldwide Plaza property may cause us to delay the sale of any properties pursuant to the Liquidation Plan until after the WWP Option is exercised.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our ability to sell the Worldwide Plaza property following our exercise of the WWP Option may be delayed by a right of first offer held by one of the tenants of the Worldwide Plaza property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The lease with one of the tenants at the Worldwide Plaza property contains a right of first offer requiring us to offer that tenant the option to purchase all of the Worldwide Plaza property, at a price (and on other material terms) proposed by us prior to our selling the Worldwide Plaza property to a third party.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If, after a 45-day period, that tenant rejects our offer or fails to deliver the purchase contract accompanying our offer, we may then sell the Worldwide Plaza property to a third party, provided that we will be required to re-offer the property to that tenant if we desire to sell the Worldwide Plaza property for a purchase price (and other economic consideration) less than 92.5% of the initial purchase price contained in our offer to that tenant.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The existence of this right of first offer may delay our ability to sell the Worldwide Plaza property on terms and in the timeframe of our choosing and may diminish the price other potential purchasers may be willing to pay for the Worldwide Plaza property, which may reduce or delay the liquidating distributions that will be paid to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we are unable to satisfy all of our obligations to creditors, or if we have underestimated our future expenses, the amount of liquidation proceeds will be reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, we intend to file articles of dissolution with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland ( SDAT ) promptly after the sale of all of our remaining assets or at such time as we have transferred our remaining assets, subject to our liabilities, into a liquidating trust.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Pursuant to Maryland law, we will continue to exist for the purpose of paying, satisfying and discharging any debts or obligations, collecting and distributing its assets, and doing all other acts required to liquidate and wind up its business and affairs.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	We intend to pay for all liabilities and distribute all of our remaining assets, which may be accomplished by the formation of a liquidating trust, before we file our articles of dissolution.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Under Maryland law, certain obligations or liabilities imposed by law on our stockholders, directors, or officers cannot be avoided by the dissolution.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	For example, if we make distributions to our stockholders without making adequate provisions for payment of creditors claims, our stockholders could be liable to the creditors to the extent of any payments due to creditors.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The liability of any stockholder is, however, limited to the amounts previously received by such stockholder from us (and from any liquidating trust).
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Accordingly, in such event, a stockholder could be required to return all liquidating distributions previously paid to such stockholder and a stockholder could receive nothing from us under the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Moreover, in the event a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received as a liquidating distribution, a repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a stockholder incurring a net tax cost if the stockholder s repayment of an amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Therefore, to the extent that we have underestimated the size of our contingency reserve and distributions to our stockholders have already been paid, our stockholders may be required to return some or all of such distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Decreases in property values may reduce the amount we receive upon sales of our assets, which would reduce the amount you receive in liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The Liquidation Plan provides for the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, all of which are real estate investments, and we cannot predict whether we will be able to do so at a price or on terms and conditions acceptable to us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Investments in real properties are relatively illiquid.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	changes in interest rates and availability of mortgage funds that may render the sale of a property difficult or unattractive; increases in operating expenses; the financial performance of our tenants, and the ability of our tenants to satisfy their obligations under their leases; vacancies and inability to lease or sublease space; potential major repairs which are not presently contemplated or other contingent liabilities associated with the assets; competition; and changes in tax, real estate, environmental and zoning laws.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If our liquidation costs or unpaid liabilities are greater than we expect, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Before making the final liquidating distribution, we will need to pay or arrange for the payment of all of our transaction costs in the liquidation, all other costs and all valid claims of our creditors.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Our board of directors may also decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us, for which we would pay a premium which has not yet been determined.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our board of directors may also decide to establish a reserve fund to pay these contingent claims.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	In addition, if the claims of our creditors are greater than we have anticipated, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced from our estimates.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Further, if we decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us or a reserve fund is established, payment of liquidating distributions to our stockholders may be delayed or reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Defaults under future sale agreements may delay or reduce liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	In connection with implementing the Liquidation Plan, we will seek to enter into binding sale agreements for each of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The consummation of the potential sales for which we will enter into sale agreements in the future will be subject to satisfaction of closing conditions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If any of the transactions contemplated by these future sale agreements do not close because of a buyer default, failure of a closing condition or for any other reason, we may not be able to enter into a new agreement on a timely basis or on terms that are as favorable as the original sale agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any delay in the completion of asset sales could delay our payment of liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We will also incur additional costs involved in locating a new buyer and negotiating a new sale agreement for this asset.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we incur these additional costs, our liquidating distributions to our stockholders would be reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	If we are unable to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and lease currently available space or if tenants default under their leases or other obligations to us during the liquidation process, our cash flow will be reduced and our liquidating distributions may be reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	We depend on tenants for revenue, and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S8	There can be no assurance that, during the implementation of the Liquidation Plan, we will be able to maintain the occupancy rates of currently-leased space, that we would be able to rent certain currently available space and that we would not experience any significant tenant defaults during the liquidation process that were not subsequently cured.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Negative trends in one or more of these factors during the liquidation process may adversely affect the sales price of the impacted assets, which would reduce our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Moreover, to the extent that we receive less rental income than we expect during the liquidation process, our liquidating distributions will be reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We may also decide in the event of a tenant default to restructure the lease, which could require us to substantially reduce the rent payable to us under the lease, or make other modifications that are unfavorable to us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P14_S12	Any reduction in our operating cash flow could cause the payment of liquidating distributions to our stockholders to be delayed or reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Because the Liquidation Plan has been approved by our stockholders, we will not resume paying monthly dividends.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In October 2016, we announced that, in light of the Liquidation Plan, which was then subject to stockholder approval, our board of directors had determined that we would not pay a regular dividend for the month of November 2016 and did not expect to pay a regular monthly dividend for the month of December 2016 or thereafter.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Because the Liquidation Plan was approved by our stockholders, we will not resume paying monthly dividends.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We expect to make periodic liquidating distributions out of net proceeds of assets sales, subject to satisfying our liabilities and obligations, in lieu of regular monthly dividends.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	There can be no assurance as to the actual amount or timing of liquidating distributions you will receive.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Pursuing the Liquidation Plan may increase the risk that we will become liable for U.S. federal income and excise taxes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that we distribute to our stockholders during each taxable year (or, under certain circumstances, during the subsequent taxable year) dividends equal to our taxable income for the year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain).
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	However, we are subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that our taxable income exceeds the amount of dividends distributed to our stockholders for the taxable year.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which certain distributions paid by us with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that year, plus 95% of our capital gain net income for that year, plus 100% of our undistributed taxable income from prior years.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	While we intend to make distributions to our stockholders sufficient to avoid the imposition of any U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and the imposition of the excise tax, differences in timing between our actual cash flow and the recognition of our taxable income, could cause us to have to either borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, find another alternative for meeting the REIT distribution requirements, or pay U.S. federal income and excise taxes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	In addition (and as discussed in more detail below), net income from the sale of properties that are dealer properties (a prohibited transaction under the Code) would be subject to a 100% excise tax.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P16_S5	The cost of borrowing or the payment of U.S. federal income and excise taxes would reduce the amount of liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P16_S6	The sale of our assets may cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on the net income from prohibited transactions, which would reduce the amount of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	REITs are subject to a 100% excise tax on any net income from prohibited transactions, which include sales or other dispositions of property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the REIT s trade or business which is not a foreclosure property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The determination of whether property is held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business is inherently factual in nature and, thus, cannot be predicted with certainty.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Code provides a safe harbor which, if all its conditions are met, would protect a REIT s property sales from being considered prohibited transactions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The conditions include, among other things, that the property be held by us for at least two years for the production of rental income and that we do not have more than seven property sales in any taxable year (there are alternative conditions to this seven sales condition, but those alternatives could not be met in the context of our complete liquidation).
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Each of the properties we currently own has been held by us for at least two years for the production of rental income, and we may attempt to manage the timing of the sales of our properties so that we are able to meet the safe harbor in connection with the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	However, if we were to exercise the WWP Option and if we are to completely liquidate within 24 months of approval of the Liquidation Plan by our stockholders, it is possible that the IRS could take the position that we do not satisfy the safe harbor with respect to the portion of the Worldwide Plaza property we acquired through the exercise of the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Regardless of whether a transaction qualifies for the safe harbor, we believe, but cannot assure you, that all of our properties are held for investment, should not be considered to be held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business (including our interest in the Worldwide Plaza property and any additional interest acquired through the exercise of the WWP Option) and we intend to structure our property sales pursuant to the Liquidation Plan in a manner that none of these sales will be subject to this tax.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P17_S7	However, because of the number of properties that would have to be sold and the inability to meet the safe harbor with respect to at least a portion of the Worldwide Plaza property, there is a risk that the IRS could seek to treat some or all of the property sales as prohibited transactions resulting in the payment of taxes by us, in which case the amount of liquidating distributions to our stockholders could be significantly reduced.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Distributing interests in a liquidating trust may cause you to recognize taxable gain prior to the receipt of cash.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The REIT provisions of the Code generally require that each year we distribute as a dividend to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Liquidating distributions we make pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will qualify for the dividends paid deduction, provided that they are made within 24 months of the adoption of such plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Conditions may arise which cause us not to be able to liquidate within such 24-month period.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	For instance, it may not be possible to sell our assets at acceptable prices during such period.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In such event, rather than retain our assets and risk losing our status as a REIT, we intend, for tax purposes, to transfer our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust in order to meet the 24-month requirement.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We may also elect to transfer our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust within such 24-month period to avoid the costs of operating as a public company.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Such a contribution would be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders, followed by a contribution of the assets to the liquidating trust.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	As a result, you would recognize gain to the extent your share of the cash and the fair market value of any assets received by the liquidating trust, less any liabilities assumed by the liquidating trust, was greater than your tax basis in your shares of common stock (reduced by the amount of all prior liquidating distributions paid to you during the liquidation period) prior to the subsequent sale of such assets and the distribution to you of the net cash proceeds, if any.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Pursuant to IRS guidance, the liquidating trust generally could have up to three years to complete the sale of our assets and distribute the net proceeds to you.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Such transfer also may have adverse tax consequences for tax-exempt and non-U.S. stockholders, including with respect to the on-going activity of the liquidating trust.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S10	In addition, it is possible that the fair market value of the assets received by the liquidating trust, as estimated for purposes of determining the extent of the stockholder s gain at the time interests in the liquidating trust are distributed to the stockholders, will exceed the cash or fair market value of property received by the liquidating trust on a sale of the assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P19_S11	In this case, the stockholder would recognize a loss in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which the gain was recognized, which loss may be limited under the Code.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our entity value may be adversely affected by the implementation of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The implementation of the Liquidation Plan and our engaging in the process of winding-up our operations may dissuade parties that might have an interest in acquiring our company from pursuing such an acquisition and may, especially as the liquidation process progresses and draws closer to completion, also preclude other possible courses of action not yet identified by our board of directors.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Accordingly, as we sell assets, it may reduce the likelihood of a party making an offer to acquire us at an entity-level for a value that exceeds what we could realize from individual asset sales.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our board of directors may terminate or amend the Liquidation Plan without stockholder approval.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Our board of directors has adopted and approved the Liquidation Plan and may terminate the Liquidation Plan without stockholder approval (i) if our board of directors approves us entering into an agreement involving the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or common stock by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale or other transaction involving us or (ii) if our board of directors determines, in exercise of its duties under Maryland law, after consultation with its advisor and its financial advisor (if applicable) or other third party experts familiar with the market for Manhattan office properties, that there is an adverse change in the market for Manhattan office properties that reasonably would be expected to adversely affect proceeding with the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	This power of termination may be exercised up to the time that the articles of dissolution have been accepted for record by the SDAT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	In addition, our board of directors may amend the Liquidation Plan without further action by our stockholders to the extent permitted under then current law.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Subject to the conditions described above, our board of directors may conclude either that its duties under applicable law require it to pursue business opportunities that present themselves or that abandoning the Liquidation Plan is otherwise in our best interests.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	If our board of directors elects to pursue any alternative to the Liquidation Plan, our stockholders will not receive any further liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Because liquidating distributions may be made in multiple tax years, if we were to abandon the Liquidation Plan in a tax year subsequent to one in which we already made liquidating distributions, the timing and character of your taxation with respect to liquidating distributions made to you in the prior tax year could change, which may subject you to tax liability (which tax liability could be at ordinary income rather than capital gains rates) in the prior tax year that you would not otherwise have been subject to, and we could lose our REIT status as of the beginning of such prior tax year.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The U.S. federal income tax consequences of abandoning the Liquidation Plan are not entirely clear once we have begun making liquidating distributions, in particular because liquidating distributions could be made in multiple tax years during the 24 months we have for U.S. federal income tax purposes to complete our liquidation after the Liquidation Plan has been approved by our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In general, distributions to you under the Liquidation Plan, including your pro rata share of the fair market value of any assets that are transferred to a liquidating trust, should not be taxable to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the aggregate amount of liquidating distributions to you exceeds your adjusted tax basis in your shares of common stock, and then should be taxable to you as capital gain (assuming you hold your shares as a capital asset).
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	However, if we abandon the Liquidation Plan, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any liquidating distributions already made pursuant to the Liquidation Plan would change because they would no longer be treated as having been made as part of our complete liquidation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Instead, any such distributions would be treated as either a distribution made with respect to the shares you hold, subject to the normal rules of U.S. federal income tax the distributions you currently receive are subject to, or as payment to you for the sale or exchange of your shares in partial redemption of them.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Whether sale or distribution treatment would apply to you depends on your particular circumstances and we cannot predict which would apply; however, regardless of which treatment would apply, each distribution likely would be at least be partially taxable to you.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Accordingly, if we had made liquidating distributions in the tax year we adopted the Liquidation Plan which did not exceed your tax basis in your shares (and therefore were not taxable to you), and we abandoned the Liquidation Plan in the subsequent tax year, you may now have a tax liability with respect to the distributions made to you in the prior tax year, and, if they are treated as distributions rather than a sale or exchange, whether you are taxed at ordinary income or capital gains rates may depend on whether we had declared any portion of such distributions as capital gain dividends.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S7	In addition, liquidating distributions we make pursuant to the Liquidation Plan qualify for the dividends paid deduction (which helps us ensure we meet our annual distribution requirement during our liquidation process), provided that they are made within 24 months of the adoption of such plan; however, if such distributions were no longer made pursuant to our complete liquidation within 24 months of the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, whether any part of such distributions qualify for the dividends paid deduction will depend on different criteria.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S8	If we had made some liquidating distributions in one tax year and we abandoned the Liquidation Plan in the subsequent tax year, it is possible that we may not have made sufficient distributions in that first tax year to satisfy our annual distribution requirement for that tax year which, if we are unable to cure such failure, could result in the loss of our REIT status effective as of the beginning of that first tax year.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Stockholder litigation related to the Liquidation Plan could result in substantial costs and distract our management.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Historically, extraordinary corporate actions by a company, such as the Liquidation Plan, often lead to securities class action lawsuits being filed against that company.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We are already subject to a stockholder lawsuit that includes claims related to the strategic alternatives process that led to the approval of the Liquidation Plan and may become subject to more of this type of litigation as a result of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Defending ourselves in this litigation may be expensive and, even if we ultimately prevail, the process of defending against lawsuits will divert management s attention from implementing the Liquidation Plan and otherwise operating our business.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	If we do not prevail in any lawsuit, we may be liable for damages.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We cannot predict the amount of any such damages, however, if applicable, they may be significant and may cause liquidating distributions to our stockholders to be delayed.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Because the Liquidation Plan was approved on January 3, 2017, we expect to transition from the going concern to the liquidation basis of accounting, which could require us to write-down our assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Following stockholder approval of the Liquidation Plan on January 3, 2017, we anticipate changing our basis of accounting from the going-concern basis to the liquidation basis of accounting, and, commencing with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ending March 31, 2017, we will discontinue use of the going-concern basis of accounting and commence the use of liquidation basis of accounting.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In order for our financial statements to be in accordance with GAAP under the going concern basis of accounting, assets and liabilities are expected to be realized in the normal course of business.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In order for our financial statements to be in accordance with GAAP under the liquidation basis of accounting, all of our assets must be stated at the amount of consideration the entity expects to collect, and all of our liabilities must be recorded at the estimated amounts at which the liabilities are expected to be settled.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Additionally, we would be required to accrue all income and expenses we expect to earn or incur through the end of liquidation to the extent that we have a reasonable basis for estimation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As part of our transition to the liquidation basis of accounting, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of some or all of our assets and increase our liabilities or record other liabilities to reflect the anticipated effects of an orderly liquidation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Any write-downs in our assets could reduce the price that a third party would be willing to pay to acquire shares of our common stock or our assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Stockholders could be liable to creditors to the extent of liquidating distributions received if contingent reserves are insufficient to satisfy our liabilities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If a court holds at any time that we have failed to make adequate provision for our expenses and liabilities or if the amount ultimately required to be paid in respect of such liabilities exceeds the amount available from the contingency reserve and the assets of the liquidating trust, our creditors could seek an injunction to prevent us from making distributions under the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Any such action could delay or substantially diminish the cash distributions to be paid to stockholders or holders of beneficial interests of the liquidating trust under the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Under the rules of the NYSE, the exchange has discretionary authority to delist our common stock if we proceed with the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	In addition, the exchange may commence delisting proceedings against us if (i) the average closing price of our common stock falls below $1.00 per share over a 30-day consecutive trading period, (ii) our average market capitalization falls below $15.0 million over a 30-day consecutive trading period, or (iii) we lose our REIT qualification.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Even if the NYSE does not move to delist our common stock, we may voluntarily delist our common stock from the NYSE in an effort to reduce our operating expenses and maximize our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S7	If our common stock is delisted, you may have difficulty trading your shares of our common stock on the secondary market, to the extent one develops or exists.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Interests in any liquidating trust we may establish pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will be generally non-transferable.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S9	If we cannot sell our assets and pay our debts by January 3, 2019, the 24-month anniversary of stockholder approval of the Liquidation Plan, we intend, for tax purposes, to transfer and assign our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Any stockholders who have not sold their shares of common stock prior to this transfer and assignment will receive beneficial interests in the liquidating trust equivalent to their ownership interests in us as represented by the shares of our common stock they held prior to the transfer and assignment.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S11	Beneficial interests in the liquidating trust will be generally non-transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P25_S12	Because of the illiquid nature of these beneficial interests, there can be no assurance as to how long any holder thereof may be required to hold them.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Risks Related to Our Properties and Operations All of our properties are located in the New York MSA, making us dependent upon the economic climate in New York City.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	All of the real estate assets we own are located in the New York MSA.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We are subject to risks generally inherent in concentrating investments in a certain geography.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These risks resulting from a lack of diversification may become even greater in the event of a downturn in the commercial real estate industry and could significantly adversely affect the value of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A downturn in New York City s economy, in a submarket within New York City or in the overall national economy could, for example, result in reduced demand for office or lodging space.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Likewise, declines in the financial services or media sectors may have a disproportionate adverse effect on the New York City real estate market.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	We face significant competition for tenants.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do, which could limit our success when we compete with them directly.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P29_S5	We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Service Provider for tenants.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from other properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We may be unable to renew expiring leases on terms and conditions that are as, or more, favorable as the terms and conditions of the expiring leases.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	In addition, vacancies may occur at one or more of our properties due to a default by a tenant on its lease or expiration of a lease.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Vacancies may reduce the value of a property as a result of reduced cash flow generated by the property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If we are unable to promptly renew expiring leases or release the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or release the space, our cash flow and the amount of liquidating distributions we pay could be adversely affected.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Tenant credit concentrations make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to those tenants.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the following tenants represented 5% or more of our total annualized cash rents:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	________________________ (1) Annualized cash rent reflects our 48.9% pro rata share of rent generated by Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The financial failure of any or all of these tenants is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, the value of the applicable property or the amount or timing of liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, the value of our properties are driven in part by the credit quality of the underlying tenants, and an adverse change in the tenants financial conditions or a decline in the credit rating of such tenants may result in a decline in the value of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	A bankruptcy filing by one of our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant's lease obligations would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	There is no assurance the tenant or its trustee would agree to assume the lease.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages and it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the amount or timing of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	The transition of advisory services from the Advisor to the Service Provider may adversely affect or business or our ability to implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S8	On December 19, 2016, we entered into a series of agreements, including the Services Agreement and amendments to the Advisory Agreement and the Property Management Agreement, pursuant to which the Service Provider became the exclusive advisor to us with respect to all matters primarily related to the Liquidation Plan effective January 3, 2017 and will replace the Advisor as the external advisor to us with respect to all other matters on the Transition Date.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S9	There can be no assurance, however, that the agreements with respect to the transition of services from the Advisor to the Service Provider will be sufficient to prevent any disruption or adverse effect to our business or our ability to implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S10	Our ability to operate our business and implement the Liquidation Plan depends upon the participation of executive officers, and other key personnel of the Service Provider, and there is no assurance such officers and personnel will remain in place.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S11	We are an externally managed company and have no employees of our own, and our ability to operate our business, including implementing the Liquidation Plan and otherwise operate on a day-to-day basis, will depend to a significant degree upon the contributions of our executive officers, and other key personnel of the Service Provider.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S12	Personnel and services that we require are provided to us under contracts with an external advisor, and we are dependent on an external advisor to manage our operations and manage our real estate assets, including sale of our real estate assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S13	These responsibilities also include arranging financings, providing accounting services, providing information technology services, preparing and filing all reports required to be filed by it with the SEC, the IRS and other regulatory agencies, maintaining our REIT status, and maintaining our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act").
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P34_S14	The Service Provider replaced the Advisor as the exclusive advisor to us with respect to all matters primarily related to the Liquidation Plan on January 3, 2017 and will replace the Advisor as the external advisor to us with respect to all other matters on the Transition Date.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	On December 19, 2016, in connection with our entry into the Services Agreement, we also entered into a letter agreement with the Advisor requiring us to fund, and the Advisor to pay, certain amounts to incentivize and retain certain personnel of the Advisor and its affiliates during the term of the Advisory Agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	However, there still can be no assurance that all, or any, of these key personnel will continue to provide services to us or the Advisor in connection with the transition of advisory services from the Advisor to the Service Provider, and the loss of any of these key personnel could adversely affect our business and our ability to successfully implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The loss of, or inability to retain, any key personnel of the Service Provider could also adversely affect our business or our ability to successfully implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Under the Services Agreement, we have agreed that, on the Transition Date, we will appoint Wendy Silverstein as our chief executive officer and John Garilli as our chief financial officer, but there can be no assurance that these individuals, or suitable replacements, will be available to serve in these capacities or that the Service Provider will otherwise be able to retain the executive officers and other key personnel needed to successfully implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	Moreover, the Services Agreement may be terminated if Ms. Silverstein resigns or is otherwise unavailable to serve as our chief executive officer for any reason and the Service Provider has not identified a replacement chief executive officer who is acceptable to a majority of our independent directors, and any termination of the Services Agreement on this basis could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement the Liquidation Plan and our business.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S5	Any adverse changes in the financial condition of, or our relationship with, the Service Provider could hinder its ability to successfully manage our operations and our portfolio of investments.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S6	Additionally, changes in ownership or management practices, the occurrence of adverse events affecting the Service Provider or its affiliates or other companies advised by the Service Provider and its affiliates could create adverse publicity and adversely affect us and our relationship with lenders, tenants or counterparties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S7	Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P35_S8	Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	periods of high interest rates and tight money supply.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage would reduce our cash flows and our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our general liability coverage, property insurance coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties may not be adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Similarly, we may not have adequate coverage against the risk of direct physical damage or to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Moreover, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Insurance risks associated with such catastrophic events could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S5	This risk is particularly relevant with respect to potential acts of terrorism.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S6	The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "TRIA"), under which the U.S. federal government bears a significant portion of insured losses caused by terrorism, will expire on December 31, 2020, and there can be no assurance that Congress will act to renew or replace the TRIA following its expiration.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S7	In the event that the TRIA is not renewed or replaced, terrorism insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain at reasonable costs or at all, which may result in adverse impacts and additional costs to us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Changes in the cost or availability of insurance due to the non-renewal of the TRIA or for other reasons could expose us to uninsured casualty losses.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S9	If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss, which would reduce our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S10	In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S11	Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, the amount of liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders would be negatively impacted.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S12	Additionally, mortgage lenders insist in some cases that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S13	Accordingly, to the extent terrorism risk insurance policies are not available at reasonable costs, if at all, our ability to finance or refinance our properties could be impaired.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S14	In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S15	We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S16	Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, civilian unrest, or war may affect the markets in which we operate our business and our profitability.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S17	Our properties are located in the New York MSA which has experienced, and remains susceptible to, terrorist attacks.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S18	In addition, any kind of terrorist activity or violent criminal acts, including terrorist acts against public institutions or buildings or modes of public transportation (including airlines, trains or buses) could have a negative effect on our business and the value of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P37_S19	More generally, any terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including armed conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the worldwide financial markets and economy including demand for properties and the availability of financing.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We are required to pay real property taxes in respect of our properties and such taxes may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	An increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and reduce the amount of liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters and discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect our operating results.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations (including those of foreign jurisdictions), a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The costs of removal or remediation could be substantial.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P40_S6	In addition, when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property, which would adversely affect our operating results.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could materially adversely affect our business, the value of our properties or our results of operations and, consequently, the amounts available to make liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Environmental laws also may impose liens on property or restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from operating such properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require us to incur material expenditures.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There are costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "Disabilities Act").
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Our properties are subject to the Disabilities Act.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for "public accommodations" and "commercial facilities" that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	The Disabilities Act's requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our business could suffer in the event the Service Provider or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations experiences system failures or cyber-incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the internal information technology systems of the Service Provider and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	A cyber-incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	More specifically, a cyber-incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can result in third parties gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	As reliance on technology in our industry has increased, so have the risks posed to the systems of the Service Provider and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In addition, the risk of a cyber-incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted attacks and intrusions evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The remediation costs and lost revenues experienced by a victim of a cyber-incident may be significant and significant resources may be required to repair system damage, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, loss of revenues and litigation, caused by any breaches.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, a security breach or other significant disruption involving the IT networks and related systems of the Service Provider or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations could:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	adversely impact our reputation among our tenants, guests at our hotel and investors generally.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Although the Service Provider and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, there can be no assurance that those measures will be sufficient, and any material adverse effect experienced by the Service Provider and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations could, in turn, have an adverse impact on us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Any hedging strategies we utilize may not be successful in mitigating our risks.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have entered into hedging transactions to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or own real estate assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	To the extent that we use derivative financial instruments in connection with these risks, we are exposed to credit, basis and legal enforceability risks.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Derivative financial instruments may include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In this context, credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Basis risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual risks, including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative contract.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	We may not be able to manage these risks effectively.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest Employees of the Service Provider, including employees who will be our executive officers, face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with the Service Provider and its affiliates.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We are an externally managed company and have no employees.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Personnel and services that we require are provided to us under contracts with an external advisor, which will be the Service Provider effective on the Transition Date, and we will be dependent on the Service Provider to manage our operations and manage our real estate assets, including sale of our real estate assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Employees or consultants of the Service Provider who will provide services to us, including employees or consultants who will serve as our officers, also hold or may hold positions with the Service Provider and its affiliates and provide services with respect to other entities or with respect to other properties or businesses of the Service Provider and its affiliates, which could result in conflicts of interest.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The Service Provider and its affiliates or entities that they advise own properties, and may seek to acquire additional properties, in the New York metropolitan area.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Conflicts could result in actions or inactions by the Service Provider or employees or consultants of the Service Provider, including employees or consultants who will be our executive officers, that are detrimental to our business.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) terms and timing of sales of properties (c) the lease of vacant space or renewal of existing leases at our properties as compared to properties owned or managed by affiliates of the Service Provider, and (d) any decision to sell our company and abandon the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The Service Provider and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the structure of the fees they receive, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Under the Services Agreement, the Service Provider is entitled to certain fees and other compensation which may result in its interests not being wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	For example, the Service Provider could be motivated to recommend certain actions that could increase the potential that it will earn incentive fees, but which may not be consistent with actions desired by our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may fluctuate.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We depend on our OP and its subsidiaries for cash flow and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of our OP and its subsidiaries.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Our only significant asset is the general partnership interests we own in our OP and assets held by us for the use and benefit of our OP.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We conduct, and intend to continue conducting, all of our business operations through our OP.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S3	Accordingly, we rely on distributions from our OP and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S4	There is no assurance that our OP or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay distributions to us that will enable us to pay our obligations.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Each of our OP's subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from these entities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S6	In addition, because we are a holding company, stockholder claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our OP and its subsidiaries.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S7	Therefore, in connection with implementing the Liquidation Plan or in the event of our bankruptcy or reorganization, our assets and those of our OP and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy stockholder claims as stockholders only after all of our and our OP's and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S8	Existing stockholders interests will be diluted if we issue additional shares in connection with the OPP.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S9	Additional limited partnership units of the OP entitled LTIP units ( LTIP units ) issued under our 2014 Second Amended and Restated 2014 Advisor Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement (the OPP ) to the Advisor are eligible to be earned in the third and final year of the OPP on April 15, 2017 (the Year 3 LTIP units ) and, if earned, will be converted on a one-for-one basis into shares of our common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S10	If a change of control (as defined in the OPP) occurs prior to April 15, 2017, the calculation of the Year 3 LTIP units will be made as of the day immediately preceding the close of the change of control and the value of such Year 3 LTIP units will be paid to the Advisor in cash at the closing.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P59_S11	In either event, the number of Year 3 LTIP units earned will be calculated based on the achievement of certain absolute and relative performance criteria related to the total return to our stockholders (share price appreciation plus dividends and other distributions).
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Existing stockholders interests will be diluted (and the amount of liquidating distributions each share of common stock will be entitled to will be reduced) if we issue additional shares of common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers and directors are limited, which could reduce recoveries against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors and our officers.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S3	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S4	We and our stockholders also may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce recoveries against them.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S5	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs or otherwise reimburse for losses incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents, or the Advisor, the Service Provider and their respective affiliates in some cases pursuant to our agreements with them.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S6	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P60_S7	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Similarly, this restriction further limits a stockholder's ability to sell shares.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P68_S1	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large ownership interest in us and exercise voting power in electing directors, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a "control share acquisition" have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	"Control shares" are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P70_S3	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	A "control share acquisition" means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P71_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Office Industry Risks Declines in overall activity in the New York MSA may adversely affect the performance of our office properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	A total of 83% of our properties measured by rentable square feet as of December 31, 2016 consisted of commercial office properties located in the New York MSA.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Rental income from office properties may fluctuate with general market and economic conditions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Our office properties may be adversely affected by market or economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy or real estate industry as a whole.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Because our portfolio includes commercial office buildings located in the New York MSA, which has a relatively large number of financial and professional services sector, significant job losses in the financial and professional services sector, which may decrease demand for office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P74_S3	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P74_S4	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect the value of the impacted property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P74_S5	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished because, during periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We may be adversely affected by certain trends that reduce demand for office real estate.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Some businesses are rapidly evolving to increasingly permit employee telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P75_S2	These practices enable businesses to reduce their space requirements.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P75_S3	A continuation of the movement towards these practices could over time erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Retail Industry Risks Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	A total of 9% of our property holdings measured by rentable square feet as of December 31, 2016 is comprised of commercial retail properties located in the New York MSA.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	A retail property's revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our retail properties may be negatively impacted.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P78_S2	Some of our leases provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P78_S3	We also have leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P78_S4	Under those leases which contain contingent rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we derive from contingent rent leases could decline in a general economic downturn.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P79_S3	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition and could reduce or delay our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant's lease is terminated.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	These "co-tenancy" provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P82_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Our retail tenants face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as retailing conducted through internet websites (which we refer to as e-commerce), discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs and telemarketing.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S2	Other retail properties within the market area of our retail properties may compete with our retail properties for customers, affecting their tenants' cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S3	In addition, some of our tenants' rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S4	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S5	Moreover, the use of the internet by consumers continues to gain popularity and migration towards e-commerce is expected to continue.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S6	This increase in internet sales could result in a downturn in the business of our current tenants in their "brick and mortar" locations and could affect the way future tenants lease space.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S7	Our hotel is subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P83_S8	One of the properties we own is a hotel located in New York City that is subject to all the risks of the hotel industry, particularly the hotel industry in the New York MSA, which may include:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P84_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P84_S1	In addition, the hotel industry may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as extreme weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P85_S0	As a REIT, we cannot directly or indirectly operate our lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P85_S1	We cannot and do not directly or indirectly operate our lodging property and instead rely on the ability of a third-party hotel management company to operate our lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any lodging property or actively participate in the decisions affecting its daily operations.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P85_S3	The lodging property that we own is leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ), which has entered into a hotel management agreement with a third-party hotel management company to operate the properties that we have leased to the TRS.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P85_S4	We cannot and do not control this third-party hotel management company, which is responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P85_S5	Thus, even if we believe our lodging property is being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party hotel management company to change its method of operation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P85_S6	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator generally may adversely affect the performance of our lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We rely on the third-party hotel management company to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S1	We do not, however, control the design or implementation of or changes to these internal controls.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S2	We may not be able to require the third-party hotel management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S3	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S4	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S5	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party hotel management company has implemented at our lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S6	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at our lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S7	If we replace the third-party hotel management company, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at our lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S8	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party hotel management company with substantial prior lodging experience in the future and could experience disruptions in our operations.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S9	Our use of the TRS structure increases our expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P86_S10	A TRS structure subjects us to the risk of increased lodging operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The performance of any TRS is based on the operations of the applicable lodging property.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Our operating risks include not only changes in hotel revenues and changes to our TRSs' ability to pay the rent due to us under the leases, but also increased hotel operating expenses, including, but not limited to, the following cost elements:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P88_S0	There are risks associated with employing hotel employees.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P88_S1	We are generally subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel employees.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P88_S2	Our lodging property is leased to a TRS, which entered into a hotel management agreement with a third-party hotel management companies to operate the lodging properties that we lease to the TRS.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Hotel operating revenues and expenses for this property are included in our consolidated results of operations.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P88_S4	As a result, although we do not directly employ or manage the labor force at our lodging properties, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Our third-party property manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at our lodging property and for establishing and maintaining the appropriate processes and controls over such activities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P89_S1	From time to time, the operations of our lodging property may be disrupted through strikes, public demonstrations or other labor actions and related publicity.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P89_S2	We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of the aforementioned disruptions, or contract disputes or other events.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P89_S3	Our third-party property manager may be targeted by union actions or adversely impacted by the disruption caused by organizing activities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P90_S0	We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Our business is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P91_S1	The total principal amount of our combined outstanding indebtedness, which generally comprises mortgage loans secured by our properties, our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's indebtedness and our other mortgage and mezzanine indebtedness was $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P92_S0	We may borrow additional funds if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P92_S1	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P92_S2	We may be unable to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P92_S3	Our substantial indebtedness and the cash flow associated with serving our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the risks that:
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P93_S0	prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) may result in higher interest rates, which could adversely affect net income, cash flow and our ability to service debt and pay liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P93_S1	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P93_S2	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of an investment in our common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P93_S3	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P93_S4	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P93_S5	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of dividends required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P94_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P94_S1	If we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P95_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P95_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the amount of liquidating distributions we will be able to pay.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S0	Covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness could limit our operational and financial flexibility or result in covenant breaches.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S1	The POL Loans contain operating covenants and covenants related to maintaining minimum net worth and liquid assets that could limit our financial and operational flexibility, In addition, we will be unable to pay liquidating distributions until we repay the release amounts required to be paid upon property sales under the POL Loans, which may delay the timing of liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S2	The other mortgage loans we have include certain property-level financial covenants including debt service coverage ratios covenants, as well as transfer restrictions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S3	The mortgages relating to many of the properties we have acquired include restrictions, such as prepayment penalties or assumption fees, that could affect our ability to sell properties or the net proceeds we would realize upon a sale.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S4	These covenants may negatively impact our ability to complete sales of our assets or the timing and amount of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S5	If we fail to satisfy those covenants, we would be in default and may be required to repay our indebtedness with capital from other sources.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S6	Under such circumstances, other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S7	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and reduce the amount of liquidating distributions we pay to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S8	We have incurred substantial indebtedness, of which $1.1 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2016 , among other things, bears interest at variable interest rates.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S9	We have not entered into any swaps, and have purchased LIBOR caps on only $305.0 million of this variable rate indebtedness, to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates on this variable rate indebtedness.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S10	Accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S11	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S12	U.S. Federal Income Tax Risks Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and reduce the amount of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S13	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT until we have completed our liquidation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S14	However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in our best interests, or inadvertently.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S15	Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S16	The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S17	Furthermore, any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service ( the "IRS") and is not a guarantee that we will qualify, or continue to qualify, as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S18	Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S19	Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S20	Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S21	Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S22	Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S23	If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S24	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P96_S25	Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for distribution to stockholders, including liquidating distributions, because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S0	Even though we qualify as a REIT, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S1	Even though we qualify and to the extent we maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S2	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are "dealer" properties sold by a REIT (a "prohibited transaction" under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S3	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S4	We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S5	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our OP or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRSs, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S6	Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S7	To maintain our qualification as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S8	In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S9	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which dividends we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S10	It is possible that we might not be able to pay distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings in order to continue to qualify as a REIT during our liquidation process.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P97_S11	Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRSs may be subject to 100% excise tax.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P98_S0	A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P98_S1	Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P98_S2	A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P99_S0	Overall, no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the gross value of a REIT's assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P100_S0	A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P100_S1	We will lease any "qualified lodging facilities" we own to one or more TRSs which in turn contract with independent third-party hotel management companies to operate such "qualified lodging facilities" on behalf of such TRSs.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P100_S2	We may use our TRSs generally for other activities as well, such as to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S0	A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S1	In addition, the rules, which are applicable to us as a REIT, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's-length basis.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S2	If our leases to our TRSs are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S3	In order for rent to qualify as "rents from real property" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S4	If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S5	If our OP failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S6	We intend to maintain the status of our OP as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S7	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our OP as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S8	In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that our OP could make to us.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S9	This also would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S10	This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay liquidating distributions and the yield on an investment in our common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S11	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which our OP owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the OP.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P101_S12	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P102_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P102_S1	The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or in certain cases to hedge previously acquired hedges entered into to manage risks associated with property that has been disposed of or liabilities that have been extinguished, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute "gross income" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P102_S3	To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P102_S4	As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P102_S5	This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P102_S6	In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Complying with REIT requirements may force us to forego and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets, including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage-related securities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S1	The remainder of our investment in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S2	In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) and no more than 25% (20% for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S3	If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S4	As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets from our portfolio or not make otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S5	These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S6	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce dividends to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S7	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S8	While we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in our best interests.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S9	If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P104_S10	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the market price of our common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P105_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P105_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and there can be no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P105_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P105_S3	Stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on their investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P105_S4	Although REITs generally receive better tax treatment than entities taxed as regular corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P105_S5	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P105_S6	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P106_S0	The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our shares of stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S1	Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares of stock under this requirement.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S2	Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S3	To help ensure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of our shares of stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S4	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT while we so qualify.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S5	Unless exempted by our board of directors, for so long as we qualify as a REIT, our charter prohibits, among other limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock, any person from beneficially or constructively owning (applying certain attribution rules under the Code) more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S6	Our board of directors may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would result in the termination of our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S7	These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S8	These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P107_S9	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P108_S0	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ("FIRPTA") and other guidance by the IRS liquidating distributions to the extent attributable to sales or exchanges of "U.S. real property interests" ("USRPIs") generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder (other than a qualified pension plan, entities wholly owned by a qualified pension plan and certain foreign publicly traded entities) as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P108_S1	However, liquidating distributions will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10% of the class of our stock at any time during the one- year period ending on the date the liquidating distribution is received.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P108_S2	Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P108_S3	Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a "domestically-controlled qualified investment entity".
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P108_S4	A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT's stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P108_S5	We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically- controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P108_S6	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if (a) our common stock is "regularly traded," as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 10% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P109_S0	Potential characterization of dividends or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax- exempt investors.
1474464_17_ITEM1A_P109_S1	If (a) we are a "pension-held REIT," (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred (or is deemed to have incurred) debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Code.

1474464_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders As of January 31, 2017 , we had 167.9 million shares of common stock outstanding held by a total of 777 stockholders of record.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Dividends We have elected to qualify as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P2_S1	As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P2_S2	The amount actually paid to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including the amount of funds available, financial condition, capital expenditure requirements and annual distribution requirements needed to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	From December 2010 to April 2014, our board of directors approved and we declared and paid monthly dividends at an annualized rate equal to $0.605 per share of common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the applicable period at a per share rate of $0.0016575342 per day.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P3_S1	In April 2014, our board of directors approved a change in this rate and we began paying monthly dividends at an annualized rate equal to $0.46 per share of common stock, beginning with the April 2014 payment.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P3_S2	In October 2016, we announced that our board of directors had determined that we would not pay a regular dividend for the months of November and December 2016 in anticipation of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P3_S3	Due to the approval of the Liquidation Plan by our stockholders, we thereafter expect to make periodic liquidating distributions out of net proceeds from asset sales, subject to satisfying our liabilities and obligations, in lieu of regular monthly dividends.

1474464_17_ITEM5_P12_S1	Our board of directors has delegated its administrative responsibilities under the stock option plan to our compensation committee.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P12_S2	In this capacity, our compensation committee has the full authority to: (1) administer and interpret the stock option plan; (2) authorize the granting of awards; (3) determine the eligibility of directors, officers, advisors, consultants and other personnel, including the Advisor, Property Manager and affiliates, as well as personnel of the Advisor, Property Manager and affiliates, and any of our joint venture affiliates, to receive an award; (4) determine the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each award (subject to the individual participant limitations provided in the stock option plan); (5) determine the terms, provisions and conditions of each award (which may not be inconsistent with the terms of the stock option plan); (6) prescribe the form of instruments evidencing such awards; and (7) take any other actions and make all other determinations that it deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the stock option plan or the administration or interpretation thereof; however, neither the compensation committee nor the board of directors may take any action under our stock option plan that would result in a repricing of any stock option without having first obtained the affirmative vote of our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P12_S3	In connection with this authority, our board or directors or our compensation committee may, among other things, establish performance goals that must be met in order for awards to be granted or to vest, or for the restrictions on any such awards to lapse.

1474464_17_ITEM5_P14_S1	Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until the restrictions are removed and the shares have vested.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P14_S2	Holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed.
1474464_17_ITEM5_P14_S3	Any distributions payable in shares of common stock will be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.

1474464_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	______________________________ (1) Historical figures have been adjusted to comply with new accounting guidance effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, which now requires deferred financing costs related to mortgage notes payable to be reflected as a reduction of the principal amount of the liability instead of as an asset.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include: Revenue Recognition Our revenues, which are derived primarily from rental income, include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of each lease reported on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, GAAP requires us to record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P0_S5	We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P0_S6	When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession or controls the physical use of the leased space.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	For the tenant to take possession, the leased space must be substantially ready for its intended use.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	To determine whether the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use, we evaluate whether we own or the tenant owns the tenant improvements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	If we are the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of the finished space, which is when such improvements are substantially complete.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	When we conclude that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	If we conclude that we are the owner of tenant improvements, we capitalize the cost to construct the tenant improvements, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	If we conclude that the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we record our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which is included in deferred leasing costs, net on the consolidated balance sheets and amortized as a reduction to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we will record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write-off of the receivable in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	We own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant's sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, we defer the recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income is achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based are known.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	If we own certain properties with leases that include these provisions, contingent rental income will be included in rental income on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Our hotel revenues are recognized as earned and are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	Investments in Real Estate We evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	In business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective estimated fair values.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Intangible assets or liabilities may include the value of in-place leases, above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the comparable fair market lease rate, measured over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	The fair value of other intangible assets, such as real estate tax abatements, are recorded based on the present value of the expected benefit and amortized over the expected useful life including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	Fair values of assumed mortgages, if applicable, are recorded as debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above- or below-market interest rates.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P8_S7	Non-controlling interests in property owning entities are recorded based on the fair value of units issued at the date of acquisition, as determined by the terms of the applicable agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	We utilize a number of sources in making our estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	We also consider information and other factors including: market conditions, the industry in which the tenant operates, characteristics of the real estate such as location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	Disposals of real estate investments that represent a strategic shift in operations that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all periods presented; otherwise, we continue to report the results of these properties' operations within continuing operations.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Properties that are intended to be sold will be designated as "held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs for all periods presented when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	Properties are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to seven years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Acquired above-market leases are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Acquired below-market leases are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Acquired above-market ground leases are amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Acquired below-market ground leases are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option period.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P12_S4	The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above- and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P12_S5	Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, are amortized as a reduction or increase to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	If such estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is based on the adjustment to estimated fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Generally, we determine estimated fair value for properties held for sale based on the agreed-upon selling price of an asset.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	These assessments may result in the immediate recognition of an impairment loss, resulting in an increase in net loss.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	We use derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our borrowings.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P17_S1	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	If we designate a qualifying derivative as a hedge, changes in the value of the derivative are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	If a derivative does not qualify as a hedge, or if we elect not to apply hedge accounting, changes in the value of the derivative are reflected in other income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	The revised guidance was to become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S3	Early adoption was not permitted under GAAP.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S4	The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S5	In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revised guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S6	We are evaluating the impact of the implementation of this guidance, including performing a preliminary review of all revenue streams to identify any differences in the timing, measurement or presentation of revenue recognition.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P20_S7	We are continuing to evaluate the allowable methods of adoption.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued an update that amends the recognition and measurement of financial instruments.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	The new guidance significantly revises an entity s accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	Among other things, it also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P21_S4	Early adoption is not permitted for most of the amendments in the update.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P21_S5	We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued an update which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The new guidance requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S5	The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S6	The revised guidance supersedes previous leasing standards and is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P22_S7	We are continuing to evaluate the impact of this new guidance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent designation.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P23_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance on how certain transactions should be classified and presented in the statement of cash flows as either operating, investing or financing activities.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	Among other things, the update provides specific guidance on where to classify debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, payments for contingent consideration made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investments.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	The amendment requires restricted cash to be included in the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total cash amounts.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	Therefore, transfers between cash and restricted cash will no longer be shown on the statement of cash flows.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued guidance that revises the definition of a business.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	This new guidance is applicable when evaluating whether an acquisition should be treated as either a business acquisition or an asset acquisition.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P26_S2	Under the revised guidance, when substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset or group of similar assets, the assets acquired would not be considered a business.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P26_S3	The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and the amendments will be applied prospectively.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P26_S4	Early application is permitted only for transactions that have not previously been reported in issued financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P26_S5	We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance relating to disclosure of uncertainties about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, the guidance requires management to disclose information that enables users of the financial statements to understand the conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of the conditions or events that led to the doubt, the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and management's plans that are intended to mitigate or that have mitigated the conditions or events that raised substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	There is no disclosure required unless there are conditions or events that have raised substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S4	The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S5	We adopted this guidance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S6	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P27_S7	In addition, due to the approval of the Liquidation Plan by our stockholders, we anticipate that the provisions of this guidance will no longer apply upon implementation of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	The revised guidance is effective for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have determined the OP is considered to be a VIE and continues to consolidate the OP as required under previous GAAP.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P28_S4	However, we meet the disclosure exemption criteria as we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest in a business and the assets of the OP can be used for purposes other than settling its obligations, such as paying distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P28_S5	Also as a result of the new guidance, we have also determined that Worldwide Plaza is a VIE, but we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore continue to not consolidate the entity.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P28_S6	As such, the adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability and that the entity apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	In August 2015, the FASB added that, for line of credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	The revised guidance is effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	As a result of adoption of the new guidance, we reclassified deferred financing costs, net related to mortgage notes payable as a reduction of the carrying amount of mortgage notes payable.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Among other things, the revised guidance allows companies to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	We have adopted the provisions of this guidance beginning January 1, 2016 and determined that there is no impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	Our policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Results of Operations Occupancy and Leasing As of December 31, 2016 , our combined portfolio, including Worldwide Plaza, was 93.4% leased, compared to 95.2% as of December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decrease in occupancy was primarily due to lease expirations at 1440 Broadway during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	Occupancy is inclusive of leases signed but not yet commenced, and therefore increases in occupancy may not result in changes in revenues and expenses immediately upon the signing of a new lease.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies for accounting policies relating to revenue recognition.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we signed new leases at 229 West 36th Street, 256 West 38th Street and 416 Washington Street bringing these properties to 100% occupancy.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	We also re-leased our expiring spaces during the year ended December 31, 2016 at increases per square foot of 31% and 46% on a cash and straight-line basis, respectively, over prior rent.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	We continue to market the remaining vacant space in our portfolio.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	We do not have plans for significant new leasing activity during the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following is a summary of our quarterly leasing activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 :
1474464_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	______________________________ (1) Replacement leases are for spaces that were leased during the period and also have been leased at some time during the prior twelve months.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	(2) Prior escalated rent is calculated as total annualized rental income on a cash or GAAP basis.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	It includes base rent, excluding recoveries.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	(3) Presented as if tenant improvements and leasing commissions were incurred in the period in which the lease was signed, which may be different than the period in which these amounts were actually paid.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	The following is a summary of lease expirations for the periods indicated:
1474464_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	_________________ (1) Combined reflects 100% of consolidated properties plus our pro rata share of unconsolidated properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	(2) Month-to-month leases are considered to expire in the Company's next fiscal quarter.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P37_S2	(3) Expiring annualized cash rent represents contractual cash base rents at the time of lease expiration and reimbursements from tenants, excluding electric reimbursements and free rent.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P37_S3	(5) Reflects our pro rata share of our unconsolidated joint venture.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P37_S4	(6) Represents antenna leases with no square feet associated.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 to Year Ended December 31, 2015 For the year ended December 31, 2016 , net loss attributable to stockholders was $82.5 million compared to $39.1 million and $93.0 million , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	The increase in net loss of $43.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to lower revenue due to vacancy at 1440 Broadway, impairment charges of $27.9 million recognized on the Viceroy Hotel and higher interest expense due to increases in total debt outstanding.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we owned 19 properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	Between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016, we sold four properties, one in 2015 (our "2015 Disposition") and three in 2016 (our "2016 Dispositions" and, together with our 2015 Disposition, our "Dispositions").
1474464_17_ITEM7_P39_S2	Additionally, our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street ("123 William Street") was redeemed in March 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We consider properties that have been owned for the entire current and prior periods to be our same store properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	Our "2016 Same Store" excludes the activity related to our Dispositions and 123 William Street.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Rental Income Rental income decreased $9.5 million to $119.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , from $129.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	The decrease in rental income was primarily driven by a decrease in occupancy at 1440 Broadway due to the expiration of large tenant leases in the fourth quarter 2015 and second quarter 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	Only a portion of this vacant space was subsequently re-leased.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	This decrease in occupancy at 1440 Broadway contributed to a decrease in rental income of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	This decrease was offset slightly by increases in rental income at 229 West 36th Street and 245-249 W. 17th Street thereby resulting in a net decrease in our 2016 Same Store revenue of $5.8 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P41_S5	The decrease in rental revenue associated with our Dispositions was $3.7 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P41_S6	Operating Expense Reimbursements and Other Revenue Operating expense reimbursements and other revenue decreased $5.2 million to $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to a $5.0 million decline in operating expense reimbursements related to 1440 Broadway and an additional $0.4 million decrease due to Our Dispositions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Pursuant to many of our lease agreements, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of certain property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S1	Therefore, operating expense reimbursements are directly affected by changes in property operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S2	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses decreased $0.2 million to $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , from $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S3	The decrease in property operating expenses primarily related to real estate taxes, utilities, maintenance and security expenses associated with our Dispositions, which resulted in a decrease of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S4	This decrease was offset by an increase of $0.6 million in our 2016 Same Store property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S5	Hotel Operations Hotel revenues increased $0.4 million to $26.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , from $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .

1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S7	The increase in hotel revenues and hotel operating expenses related primarily to increased average occupancy at the Viceroy Hotel of 85.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to 80.5% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as revenue per available room (commonly referred to in the hotel industry as "RevPAR") of $278.08 for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to $276.70 for the year ended December 31, 2015 .

1474464_17_ITEM7_P42_S11	This increase is primarily due to the Property Manager no longer waiving property management fee beginning during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	Our Property Manager is entitled to fees for the management of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenues.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , the Property Manager began charging property management fees pursuant to the Property Management Agreement, which were paid in cash.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Our Property Manager elected to waive these fees for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and we would have incurred property management fees of $1.0 million and $2.6 million , respectively, had the fees not been waived during those periods.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to our exploration of strategic alternatives and our entering into and terminating the master combination agreement we entered into with affiliates of The JBG Companies in May 2016 (the "JBG Combination Agreement"), which was subsequently terminated in August 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to the debt refinancing transactions which we entered into during the third quarter 2015, litigation at Worldwide Plaza and professional fees incurred related to the exploration of a possible strategic transaction.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we recognized impairment charges of $27.9 million on the Viceroy Hotel.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	As a result of the approval of the Liquidation Plan by our board of directors in August 2016, we reconsidered our intended holding period for all of our operating properties and evaluated the impact on our ability to recover the carrying value of such properties based on the expected cash flows over our intended holding period.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	As a result, we determined the carrying value of the Viceroy Hotel exceeded its estimated fair value resulting in an impairment charge which was recorded during the third quarter 2016.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recognized impairment charges of $0.9 million with the classification of Duane Reade as held for sale.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	The impairment charge is included in gain on sale of real estate investment, net within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P44_S5	General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $14.5 million to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .

1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	The valuation of our OPP is largely dependent on the trading price of shares of our common stock in the absolute sense and relative to the share prices of our peer group.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	Our equity-based compensation expenses tend to be volatile because we are required under GAAP to remeasure the OPP quarterly.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	See Note 16 Share-Based Compensation to the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	Equity-based compensation expenses, which are not settled in cash, contributed $1.9 million to the overall decrease in general and administrative expenses, and was partially offset by an increase of $2.3 million in other cash-settled general and administrative expenses totaling $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , compared to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S4	The main drivers of the increase in cash-settled general and administrative expenses primarily related to our exploration of strategic alternatives and other corporate and stockholder matters along with an increase in general and administrative expense reimbursements to the Advisor, which began requesting such reimbursements during the third quarter of 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we made $2.7 million in general and administrative expense reimbursements to the Advisor.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S7	This decrease primarily relates to $12.0 million of lower depreciation and amortization expense in our 2016 Same Store as a result of a decline of in-place lease and tenant improvements values related to lease expirations and lease terminations at 256 W. 38th Street and 1440 Broadway.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S8	The remaining decrease of $2.1 million was due to our Dispositions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S9	Interest Expense Interest expense increased $10.8 million to $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S10	The increase in interest expense associated with indebtedness incurred with respect to our 2016 Same Store and under our Credit Facility was $11.2 million, offset by decreases of $0.4 million in interest expense due to our Dispositions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S11	In the fourth quarter of 2016, we entered into the POL Loans, which increased our indebtedness by $275.0 million, and we repaid in full our Credit Facility using proceeds from the POL Loans.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S12	In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into several financing transactions impacting our 2016 Same Store, including the issuance of a mortgage note payable secured by our property located at 1440 Broadway, as well as the settlement through early repayment or legal defeasance of six other mortgage notes payable before the scheduled maturity dates to allow for their inclusion in the borrowing base of our Credit Facility.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S13	As a result of these transactions, we incurred additional financing costs that are being amortized to interest expense over the respective maturity dates of the debt instruments to which they are allocated.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S14	Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Venture Income from unconsolidated joint venture was $2.7 million and $1.9 million for the year s ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S16	Income from unconsolidated joint venture increased in large part due to rent escalation provisions in several large leases that became effective during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S17	Income from Preferred Equity Investment, Investment Securities and Interest Income from preferred equity investment, investment securities and interest decreased $1.1 million to approximately $26,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P45_S18	The primary driver for the decrease was the loss of income from our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street after it was redeemed in March 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Gain on Sale of Real Estate Investment, Net Gain on sale of real estate investment, net of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related primarily to the gain we recognized on the sale of our 2016 Dispositions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized gain on sale of real estate investment, net of $7.5 million related primarily to the gain we recognized on the sale of our 2015 Disposition partially offset by an impairment charge on Duane Reade of $0.9 million , recognized as a result of reclassifying the assets of that property to held-for-sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	Gain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments Loss on derivative instruments of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily related to mark-to-market adjustments on our 1440 Broadway interest rate caps, which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	We recognized $0.6 million of loss on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P46_S4	The net loss attributable to non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1.4 million and $1.2 million , respectively.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P46_S5	The decrease of $0.1 million in net loss attributable to non-controlling is primarily related to 3,336,430 OP units and 1,172,738 LTIP units redeemed for or converted into common stock during 2016 which reduced the amount of non-controlling interest outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 to Year Ended December 31, 2014 As of December 31, 2015, we owned 22 properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	Between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015, we acquired one property, 245-249 West 17th Street (our "2014 Acquisition") and sold one property, 163 Washington Avenue (our "2015 Disposition").
1474464_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	Additionally, our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street was redeemed in March 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	We consider properties that have been owned for the entire period between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 to be our same store properties.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	The increase in rental income was primarily driven by our 2014 Acquisition, which resulted in an increase in rental income of $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	We experienced a net decrease in rental income at our 2015 Same Store of $3.2 million primarily related to lease modifications and terminations at 229 W. 36th Street, 256 W. 38th Street and 1440 Broadway as well as a reduction in rental income related to a fully amortized below-market lease at 333 W. 34th Street.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S3	The net decrease in our 2015 Same Store was partially offset by increased rental revenue at 50 Varick Street, due to a lease modification, and 218 W. 18th Street and the Design Center due to lease commencements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S4	The decrease in rental revenue associated with our 2015 Disposition was $0.4 million.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S6	The increase also related to a fee paid by a tenant upon the expiration of its lease at 1440 Broadway in lieu of restoring the space to its original condition prior to vacating.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S7	Pursuant to many of our lease agreements, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of certain property operating expenses, in addition to base rent, whereas under certain other lease agreements, the tenants are directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S8	Therefore, operating expense reimbursements are directly affected by changes in property operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S9	Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses increased $6.6 million to $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S13	During the prior year, the Advisor absorbed $0.6 million.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P49_S14	The increase in property operating expenses was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease related to our 2015 Disposition.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Hotel Revenue and Operating Expenses Hotel revenues increased $3.4 million to $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P50_S4	Operating fees incurred from the Advisor represent asset management fees earned by the Advisor.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	Prior to the Listing, we issued to the Advisor restricted performance based Class B units for prior asset management services, which vested as of the Listing.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	As such, the increase was related to paying asset management fees in cash for a full year.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Our Property Manager is entitled to fees for the management of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenues.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Our Property Manager elected to waive these fees for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we would have incurred property management fees of $2.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, had these fees not been waived.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P52_S6	Vesting of Asset Management Fees Vesting of asset management fees expense of $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the vesting of Class B units previously issued to the Advisor for asset management services.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P52_S7	The performance condition related to these Class B units was satisfied upon completion of the Listing, as such this expense did not recur for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	On April 15, 2014, the Class B units were converted to OP units on a one-to-one basis.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Value of Listing Note Value of Listing Note (as defined in Note 9 Subordinated Listing Distribution to our consolidated financial statements expense of $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 represents the final value of the Listing Note, which was determined and fully expensed in the fourth quarter of 2014.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P54_S3	Equity-based compensation expenses, which are not settled in cash, contributed a large portion of the year-over-year increase in total general and administrative expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P54_S4	These expenses increased $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, due to a full year of amortization of the fair value of the OPP and a higher year-over-year fair value of the OPP, which was adopted in conjunction with the Listing.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	The valuation of our OPP is largely dependent on the trading price of shares of our common stock in the absolute sense and relative to the share prices of our peer group.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Because we are required under GAAP to remeasure the OPP quarterly, our equity-based compensation expenses tend to be volatile.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	See Note 16 Share-Based Compensation to the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	The increase in remaining general and administrative expenses, which are settled in cash, was largely associated with a $5.5 million increase in legal and professional fees primarily related to the audit of our 2014 financial statements being recognized in full during 2015 due to our change of auditors in February 2015, the engagement of internal auditors and the recognition of expenses incurred relating to the audit of our 2015 financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	Additionally, beginning in the third quarter of 2015, the Advisor began requesting reimbursement for general and administrative expenses, which amounted to $0.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S3	The increases in other general and administrative expenses were partially offset by decreases in transfer agent and proxy costs of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the Advisor renegotiating their service contracts.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S4	Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.1 million to $82.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $84.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S5	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to a decrease of $7.3 million in depreciation and amortization expense in our 2015 Same Store primarily related to lease modifications and terminations at 229 W. 36th Street, 333 W. 34th Street and 1440 Broadway as well as $0.4 million in depreciation and amortization expense related to our 2015 Disposition.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S8	The increase in interest expense is partially related to a higher weighted average Credit Facility balance outstanding of $597.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $439.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S9	In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into several financing transactions, including the issuance of a mortgage note payable secured by our property located at 1440 Broadway, which contributed $3.4 million to the increase in interest expense.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S10	In connection with these third quarter financing transactions, we also repaid four mortgage notes payable and settled through legal defeasance two mortgage notes payable before the scheduled maturity dates to allow for their inclusion in the borrowing base of our Credit Facility and accelerated $1.1 million of expense for the write-off of financing costs related to those mortgages.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P56_S11	Additionally, financing costs incurred of $4.0 million and $6.5 million, relating to the Credit Facility and the 1440 Broadway mortgage, respectively, were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the respective maturity dates of the debt instruments to which they are allocated.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	Income from unconsolidated joint venture increased in part due to increasing occupancy at Worldwide Plaza to 100.0% as of December 31, 2015 from 93.3% as of December 31, 2014 and 91.2% as of October 31, 2013, the date we acquired our interest in Worldwide Plaza.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	The primary driver for the decrease was a decline in income related to our preferred equity investment in 123 William Street, which was redeemed in March 2015, of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	The decline was partially offset by a gain on the sale of investment securities of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P57_S5	Gain on Sale of Real Estate Investment, Net Gain on sale of real estate investment, net of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to the gain we recognized on the sale of our 2015 Disposition of $8.4 million partially offset by an impairment charge on Duane Reade of $0.9 million, recognized as a result of reclassifying the assets of that property to held-for-sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P57_S6	Gain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments Loss on derivative instruments of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related primarily to missed forecast derivative losses recognized upon the early repayment of the mortgages securing One Jackson Square and 229 West 36th Street and the resulting cancellation of the interest rate swaps on those mortgages.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P57_S7	Mark-to-market adjustments on our 1440 Broadway interest rate caps, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, further contributed to the loss on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P57_S8	We recognized approximately $1,000 of gain on derivative instruments for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	The net loss attributable to non-controlling interests during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	The decrease of $0.1 million in net loss attributable to non-controlling is primarily related to our 2015 Disposition and the repayment of our partner in that property as well as lower allocable net loss.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 For the year ended December 31, 2016 , net cash used in operating activities was $3.4 million , which represents a decrease of $41.1 million from the $37.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The decrease is primarily the result of lower revenue due to our 2016 Dispositions and decreased occupancy at 1440 Broadway, higher acquisition and transaction costs primarily related to our exploration of strategic alternatives and our entering into and terminating the JBG Combination Agreement along with higher interest expense due to our financing transactions executed at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 and third quarter of 2015.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S1	Net loss of $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was adjusted for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, equity-based compensation, gains on sale of real estate investments and other non-cash charges of $88.0 million , which resulted in cash inflows from operations of $4.1 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S2	Net cash used in operating activities also reflected an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.3 million , an increase in accrued unbilled ground rent of $2.7 million , which results from recording rental expenses on a straight-line basis and an increase in deferred rent of $0.9 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S3	These cash inflows were partially offset by a decrease in unbilled rent receivables of $9.9 million recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis, a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $4.0 million and a decrease in tenant and other receivables of $0.6 million , Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 of $40.7 million primarily related to our 2016 Dispositions and distributions received from our investment in Worldwide Plaza of $27.5 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S4	These cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures for building and tenant improvements of $22.3 million primarily related to 50 Varick Street and 1440 Broadway.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S5	Net cash used in financing activities of $90.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to the repayment of our Credit Facility of $485.0 million , dividends to common stockholders of $63.3 million , regularly scheduled principal payments on mortgage notes payable as well as full repayments of three mortgage notes payable of $19.2 million , payments of financing costs of $19.0 million , primarily related to the POL Loans, payments of $0.7 million to secure interest rate caps for our Mortgage Loan and Mezzanine Loan, decreases to restricted cash of $1.0 million , distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $1.9 million and payment of $0.2 million for income taxes related to restricted shares that vested during the period.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S6	These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from our Mortgage Loan of $500.0 million secured by the POL Loan Properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S7	Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $37.7 million, which represents an increase of $31.2 million over the $6.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S8	The increase is primarily a result of strong leasing activity throughout the year ended December 31, 2015 and contractual rent escalations within our existing leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P60_S9	The increase in cash provided by operating activities also related to a lower amount of prepaid expenses and other assets as well as accounts payable and accrued expenses that were relatively unchanged year-over-year, as opposed to the large cash outflow experienced in 2014 for the payment of prior year accrued capital expenditures (see below the discussion of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P61_S1	Notwithstanding a net loss of $40.3 million, net cash provided by operating activities included adjustments for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets, equity-based compensation and other non-cash charges of $88.0 million, which resulted in cash inflows of $47.7 million.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P61_S2	Net cash provided by operating activities also reflected an increase in accrued ground rent of $3.2 million, which results from recording rental expenses on a straight-line basis, a decrease in tenant and other receivables of $1.0 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $0.3 million.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P61_S3	These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in unbilled rent receivables of $13.7 million recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis, a decrease in deferred rent of $0.7 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.1 million.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $61.9 million primarily related to our 2015 Disposition as well and the redemption of our preferred equity investment of $70.9 million, distributions received from our investment in Worldwide Plaza of $12.1 million, acquisition funds released from escrow of $4.7 million and proceeds from the sale of investment securities of $4.6 million.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	These cash inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures for building and tenant improvements of $30.3 million and the purchase of investment securities of $0.1 million.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	Net cash used in financing activities of $23.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to repayments on our Credit Facility of $150.0 million, regularly scheduled principal payments on mortgage notes payable as well as full repayments of four mortgage notes payable and settlements through legal defeasance of two mortgage notes payable before the scheduled maturity dates of $88.8 million to facilitate including the underlying properties in the borrowing base of our Credit Facility in connection with a series of debt restructuring transactions we undertook at the end of the third quarter of 2015, dividends to common stockholders of $74.7 million, payments of financing costs of $10.8 million and payments of $0.5 million to secure interest rate caps for our mortgage notes payable on 1440 Broadway.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S4	These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from mortgage notes payable of $305.0 million secured by 1440 Broadway.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S5	Cash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2014 For the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $6.5 million.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S6	The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of property operating expenses.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S7	Cash flows provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 included $16.1 million of transaction costs relating to the Listing and the acquisition of 245-249 West 17th Street.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S8	Cash flows provided by operating activities included a net loss adjusted for non-cash items, resulting in a cash inflow of $43.4 million (net loss of $94.3 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible real estate assets and other non-cash charges of $137.7 million) and an increase in accrued ground rent of $4.3 million, which resulted from recording rental expenses on a straight-line basis.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P62_S9	These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in unbilled rent receivables of $19.6 million recorded in accordance with accounting for rental income on a straight-line basis, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.7 million, primarily due to payments of prior year accrued tenant improvements at our 50 Varick Street property and fees paid to our Former Dealer Manager for services rendered in 2013 related to exploring our liquidity event, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $6.6 million, primarily due to prepaid real estate taxes, insurance and deferred leasing costs, a decrease in deferred rent of $3.4 million and an increase in tenant and other receivables of $2.8 million, primarily due to amounts related to our preferred equity investment and other tenant receivables.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $327.8 million primarily related to $316.2 million for the acquisition of 245-249 W 17th Street, acquisition funds held in escrow of $4.7 million, $11.8 million of capital expenditures and $3.1 million in purchases of additional investment securities.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures This section includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations, Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income, Cash Net Operating Income and Adjusted Cash Net Operating Income.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), is provided below.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	Funds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ( FFO ), which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure but is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards set forth in the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the White Paper ).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P66_S1	The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, but excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time, especially if not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P67_S1	We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Historical accounting for real estate requires us to depreciate or amortize our assets in accordance with GAAP.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P68_S1	Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P68_S2	Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income (loss).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P68_S3	However, FFO, core funds from operations ("Core FFO") and adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO ), as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income (loss) or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P68_S4	In calculating FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition (as we do) or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do or calculate Core FFO or AFFO differently than we do.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P68_S5	Consequently, our presentation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	We consider FFO, Core FFO and AFFO useful indicators of our performance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	Because FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs in our peer group.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries as items that are expensed under GAAP, instead of capitalized.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Core FFO is FFO, excluding transaction related costs and other items that are considered to be not comparable from period to period, such as gains on sales of securities and investments, miscellaneous revenue, such as lease termination fees and insurance proceeds, and expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P71_S1	Additionally, we exclude transaction related expenses, which are primarily comprised of expenses related to our strategic alternatives process, as these expenses are not the result of the operations of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P71_S2	By excluding transaction related costs and other items that are considered to be not comparable from period to period, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management's analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	We exclude certain income or expense items from AFFO that we consider more reflective of investing activities, other income and expense items not settled in cash and the income and expense effects of other activities that are not a fundamental attribute of our business plan.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	These items include unrealized gains and losses, which may not ultimately be realized, such as gains or losses on derivative instruments and gains or losses on contingent valuation rights.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S2	In addition, by excluding non-cash income and expense items such as equity-based compensation expenses, amortization of above-market and below-market lease intangibles, amortization of deferred financing costs and straight-line rent from AFFO, we believe we provide useful information regarding income and expense items which have a direct impact on our ongoing performance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S3	We also include second generation capital expenditures in our calculation of AFFO because these funds are paid in order to maintain the level of operating performance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S4	By providing AFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our ongoing operating performance without the impacts of transactions that are not related to the ongoing profitability of our portfolio of properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S5	We also believe that AFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the REIT industry.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S6	Further, we believe AFFO is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S7	However, AFFO is not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to make cash distributions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P72_S8	Investors are cautioned that AFFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as it excludes certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	In calculating AFFO, we exclude certain expenses, which under GAAP are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S1	All paid and accrued merger, acquisition and transaction related fees and certain other expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which expenses are incurred will also have negative effects on returns to investors, but are not reflective of our ongoing performance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S2	AFFO that excludes such costs and expenses would only be comparable to companies that did not have such activities.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S3	Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments are considered operating adjustments to net income.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S4	In addition, as discussed above, we view gains and losses from fair value adjustments as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S5	Excluding income and expense items detailed above from our calculation of AFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S6	Additionally, fair value adjustments, which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current operating performance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S7	By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe AFFO provides useful supplemental information.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P73_S8	As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The table below reflects the items deducted from or added to net income in our calculation of FFO, Core FFO and AFFO during the period presented.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	We have calculated our FFO, Core FFO and AFFO based on our net income (loss), which is before adjusting for the net loss attributable to our non-controlling interests, and all adjustments are made based on our gross adjustments, without excluding the portion of the adjustments attributable to our non-controlling interests, other than adjustments related to the unconsolidated joint venture.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	___________________________ (1) Proportionate share of depreciation and amortization related to unconsolidated joint venture and amortization of difference in basis.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	(2) Represents $0.1 million of lease termination fee revenue (first and fourth quarters) and approximately $0.1 million of insurance proceeds received relating to casualty claims (second quarter).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P75_S2	(3) Represents prepayment penalties, deferred financing and other costs that were written off as a result of paying off the Credit Facility in the fourth quarter and three mortgages in the first quarter in advance of their scheduled maturity dates.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income, Cash Net Operating Income and Adjusted Cash Net Operating Income.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	We believe that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for transaction-related expenses, other non-cash items and including our pro rata share from unconsolidated joint ventures ("Adjusted EBITDA") is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and service debt.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P77_S1	Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating activities.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P77_S2	Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that of other REITs.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net operating income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, less discontinued operations, interest, other income and income from preferred equity investments and investments securities, plus corporate general and administrative expense, transaction-related expenses, depreciation and amortization, other non-cash expenses and interest expense.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P78_S1	NOI is adjusted to include our pro rata share of NOI from unconsolidated joint ventures.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P78_S2	Cash NOI is NOI presented on a cash basis, which is NOI after eliminating the effects of straight-lining of rent and the amortization of above and below market leases.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P78_S3	Adjusted Cash NOI is Cash NOI after eliminating the effects of free rent.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P78_S4	We use NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI internally as performance measures and believe NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI provide useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P78_S5	Therefore, we believe NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI are useful measures for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets and to make decisions about resource allocations.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P78_S6	Further, we believe NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI are useful to investors as performance measures because, when compared across periods, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI reflect the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition activity on an unlevered basis.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI exclude certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P79_S1	For example, interest expense is not linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and Cash NOI is not affected by whether the financing is at the property level or corporate level.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P79_S2	In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI differently.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P80_S2	NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P80_S3	The table below reflects the reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI during the period presented.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P80_S4	We have calculated our Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, Cash NOI and Adjusted Cash NOI based on our net income, which is before adjusting for the net loss attributable to our non-controlling interests, and all adjustments are made based on our gross adjustments, without excluding the portion of the adjustments attributable to our non-controlling interests, other than adjustments related to the unconsolidated joint venture as noted in the table below.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	_________________ (1) Proportionate share of adjustments related to unconsolidated joint venture and amortization of difference in basis.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2016 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $45.5 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P82_S1	On January 3, 2017, our stockholders approved the Liquidation Plan, and we became fully authorized to commence implementing it.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P82_S2	The actual amounts and times of the liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will be determined by our board of directors or, if a liquidating trust is formed, by the trustees of the liquidating trust, in their discretion.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P82_S3	For more details on the provisions of the Liquidation Plan, see " Item 1.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	In the course of operating our business while implementing the Liquidation Plan, our principal demands for funds are to pay or fund operating expenses, capital expenditures, liquidating distributions to our stockholders, and principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	We have met our demands for funds prior to the commencement of the implementation of the Liquidation Plan, which were similar in nature, primarily through cash flows from operations, secured borrowings, preferred distributions in respect of our interest in Worldwide Plaza and the sale or redemption of certain assets.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P83_S2	Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, we will sell all our properties, which will be a primary source of capital for many of our funding needs, particularly with respect to liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P83_S3	Other future sources of capital could include proceeds from secured or unsecured financings and undistributed funds from operations (if any).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P83_S4	Our principal sources and uses of funds are further described below.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P83_S5	Our cash flows from operating activities is primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent, operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants and the level of operating and other costs, including general and administrative expenses and transaction costs and other expenses associated with selling all or substantially all of our assets pursuant to the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	POL Loans On December 20, 2016, we entered into the POL Loans, comprising of the Mortgage Loan in the principal amount of $500.0 million and the Mezzanine Loan in the principal amount of $260.0 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S1	Borrowings under the Mortgage Loan are secured by a mortgage on the POL Loan Properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S2	At the closing of the POL Loans, a portion of the net proceeds after closing costs was used to repay the $485.0 million principal amount then outstanding under our Credit Facility.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , the $260.0 million proceeds from the Mezzanine Loan was held in an escrow account by the servicer of the POL Loans and was considered a receivable in our consolidated balance sheets.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S4	Subsequently, on January 10, 2017, the $260.0 million proceeds were deposited into an operating account that may be used by us to purchase the additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza in connection with our exercise of the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S5	Other Sources of Funds In the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we sold four of our five non-core assets not located in Manhattan: 163 Washington Avenue for $37.7 million, Duane Reade for $12.6 million , 1623 Kings Highway for $17.0 million and Foot Locker for $8.4 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S6	In connection with the sale of Duane Reade, 1623 Kings Highway and Footlocker, we repaid $18.9 million in outstanding mortgage notes payable.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S7	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we received $27.5 million in preferred distributions from our investments in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S8	We expect to continue to receive cash distributions in respect of our interest in Worldwide Plaza in accordance with our investment agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S9	On September 30, 2015, we obtained a mortgage note payable of up to $325.0 million , secured by our property located at 1440 Broadway.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P84_S10	As of December 31, 2016 , the mortgage note payable outstanding was $305.0 million , and up to $20.0 million is available in the future as additional advances, subject to customary funding conditions to pay, among other things, for certain tenant allowances, capital expenditures and leasing costs that have been approved by the lender.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Principal Use of Funds Strategic Process and Transaction Costs During the year ended December 31, 2016 , we incurred $19.7 million of transaction costs, which were primarily related to our strategic alternatives process, including the expense reimbursement payment we made to JBG in connection with terminating the JBG Combination Agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	We may incur additional transaction costs relating to the Liquidation Plan in the future.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	We intend to fund transaction costs primarily with cash on hand and cash flows from operations.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	Capital Expenditures As of December 31, 2016 , we owned 19 properties.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	In connection with the leasing of our properties, we have entered into and will continue to enter into agreements with our tenants to provide allowances for tenant improvements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	These allowances require us to fund capital expenditures up to amounts specified in our lease agreements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S3	We intend to fund tenant improvement allowances with cash on hand and future borrowings and cash flows from operations.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S4	We funded $22.3 million in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2016 , which was funded primarily from cash on hand.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S5	The Company expects capital expenditures incurred during the next year, while the Company is executing its Liquidation Plan, to be significantly less than the amount incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 , as only necessary capital expenditures will be made.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S6	We are generally not permitted to engage in any business activities while implementing the Liquidation Plan, except to exercise the WWP Option to purchase additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza, pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S7	The purchase price required to exercise the WWP Option under its terms equals the product of the percentage interest being acquired and the agreed-upon property value of approximately $1.4 billion (subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments for any of our preferred return in arrears) minus the principal balance of the outstanding mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property, which was $875.0 million as of December 31, 2016 .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S8	We have the right to exercise the WWP Option by giving notice to our joint venture partner and making a $30.0 million deposit at any time during the period commencing January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, and we intend to exercise the WWP Option during this period with respect to all the equity interests in Worldwide Plaza, subject to our joint venture partner s right to retain up to 1.2% of our joint venture partner s membership interest.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S9	In accordance with the terms of the WWP Option, the closing of any purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza would occur between 30 and 90 days after we give notice of our exercise of the WWP Option, subject to extension for up to 60 days if necessary to satisfy the loan assumption conditions described below.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S10	The Worldwide Plaza property would remain subject to the mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property in connection with any purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza pursuant to our exercise of the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S11	In order to keep the mortgage and mezzanine debt encumbering the Worldwide Plaza property in place, we must satisfy certain loan assumption conditions, including meeting a minimum net worth requirement of $750.0 million and a minimum value of real estate assets controlled (through ownership or management) requirement of $2.0 billion (exclusive of our interest in the Worldwide Plaza property and cash).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S12	While we believe we currently meet such tests, there can be no assurance that we will meet them at the time that we desire to exercise the WWP Option.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S13	If we do not exercise the WWP Option, we will be subject to a fee in the amount of $25.0 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S14	We expect to fund the estimated $270.0 million in cash required at the closing of our purchase of additional equity interests in Worldwide Plaza primarily with proceeds from the POL Loans and cash on hand.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S15	Dividends From April 2014 through October 2016, our board of directors authorized, and we declared, a monthly dividend at an annualized rate equal to $0.46 per share per annum.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S16	Dividends were paid to stockholders of record on the close of business on the 8th day of each month, payable on the 15th day of such month.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S17	In October 2016, we announced that our board of directors had determined that we would not pay a regular dividend for the months of November and December 2016 in anticipation of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S18	Due to the approval of the Liquidation Plan by our stockholders on January 3, 2017, we expect to make periodic liquidating distributions out of net proceeds from asset sales, subject to satisfying our liabilities and obligations, in lieu of regular monthly dividends.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S19	The timing and amount of liquidating distributions may be affected by the factors described in Item 1A, including the requirement in the loan agreements relating to Worldwide Plaza that we have a minimum value of real estate assets controlled (through ownership or management) of $2.0 billion (exclusive of our interest in the Worldwide Plaza property and cash), which could delay the timing of asset sales, and covenants in our loan agreements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S20	For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, portions of the amounts paid to our stockholders may be a return of capital and not a return on a stockholder's investment.

1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S22	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , dividends paid totaled $65.2 million , inclusive of $1.9 million of distributions paid on OP units and participating LTIP units.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S23	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , cash used to pay our dividends was primarily generated from cash flows provided by operations, cash on hand and distributions in respect of our interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P86_S24	We are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	The following table shows the sources for the payment of dividends for the periods presented:
1474464_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	__________________ (1) Includes distributions on OP units and participating LTIP units.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , we had consolidated mortgage notes payable of $1.1 billion , excluding $427.9 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt reflecting our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza's total mortgage debt of $875.0 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the consolidated mortgage notes payable had a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% and our pro rata share of unconsolidated mortgage debt relating to Worldwide Plaza had a weighted average interest rate of 4.6% .
1474464_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	The payment terms of our mortgage loan obligations require principal and interest amounts payable monthly.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P90_S1	Some of our mortgage note agreements require compliance with certain property-level financial covenants including debt service coverage ratios.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P90_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its mortgage note agreements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	The following is a summary of our contractual debt obligations as of December 31, 2016 :
1474464_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Lease Obligations We entered into lease agreements with the owners of the ground leases at 350 Bleecker Street and the Viceroy Hotel.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P92_S1	The following table reflects the minimum base rental cash payments due from us over the next five years and thereafter under these arrangements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P92_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes, among other items.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P93_S0	Election as a REIT We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P93_S1	We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P93_S2	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P93_S3	In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P93_S4	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P93_S5	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P94_S0	Inflation Many of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P94_S1	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_17_ITEM7_P94_S2	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P94_S3	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P94_S4	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P95_S0	Related-Party Transactions and Agreements See Note 14 Related Party Transactions and Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
1474464_17_ITEM7_P96_S0	We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate debt.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We had fixed-rate secured mortgage notes payable with an aggregate carrying value of $64.1 million and a fair value of $66.1 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the notes, but it has no impact on interest due on the notes.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2016 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S5	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $0.7 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S6	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $0.7 million .
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2016 , our variable-rate debt had a carrying and fair value of $1.1 billion .
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P0_S8	Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate debt affects interest expense incurred and cash flow.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2016 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate debt would increase or decrease our interest expense by $10.7 million annually.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2016 , it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.
1474464_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

1474464_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1474464_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	In the course of preparing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements included herein, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .

1474464_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	The POL Loans were initially secured directly, in the case of the mortgage loan, and indirectly in the case of the mezzanine loan, by our properties located in New York, New York at 245-249 West 17th Street, 333 West 34th Street, 216-218 West 18th Street, 50 Varick Street, 229 West 36th Street, 122 Greenwich Street, 350 West 42nd Street, 382-384 Bleecker Street, 350 Bleecker Street, 416-425 Washington Street, 33 West 56th Street and 120 West 57th Street (the POL Loan Properties ).
1474464_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Each of the POL Loan Properties has a corresponding allocated loan amount which must be repaid upon the sale of the property in order to release the property as collateral for the POL Loans.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	Properties sold during 2017 and to date in 2018 have been released and are no longer collateral for the POL Loans.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	On December 20, 2017, the POL Loans were extended through September 30, 2018 and the Mezzanine Loan balance of $91.6 million was repaid.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	The Company paid an extension fee of $0.4 million.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P29_S4	At December 31, 2017 the Mortgage Loan has an outstanding principal amount of $176.2 million and requires monthly interest payments at a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.50%.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner during our liquidation process, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	Despite having adopted the Liquidation Plan, in order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, continue to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP )) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements until we have completely liquidated.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P31_S4	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Competition The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do which could limit our success when we compete with them directly.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P32_S4	We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Winthrop Advisor for tenants.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from other properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Regulations Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P34_S3	Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P34_S4	However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The employees of the Winthrop Advisor and their affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including property management, accounting, asset management and investor relations services.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 We are dependent on these affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset dispositions, asset and property management and other general administrative responsibilities.
1474464_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Financial Information About Industry Segments With the adoption of the plan of liquidation, we have only one reporting segment subsequent to January 3, 2017.

1474464_18_ITEM1_P37_S6	We are not incorporating our website or any information from the website into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In this section, references to you refers to the holders of our common stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Risks Related to The Liquidation Plan We cannot assure you of the actual amount you will receive in liquidating distributions pursuant to the Liquidation Plan or when you will receive them.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The net proceeds of the Liquidation Plan will be distributed to stockholders over time in one or more liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The actual amount that we will distribute to you in the liquidation will depend upon the actual amount of our liabilities, the actual proceeds from the sale of our properties, the actual fees and expenses incurred in connection with the sale of our properties, the actual expenses incurred in the administration of our properties prior to disposition, our actual general and administrative expenses, including fees and expense reimbursements paid to the Winthrop Advisor and its affiliates and other liabilities that may be incurred by us, our ability to continue to meet the requirements necessary to retain our status as a REIT throughout the liquidation process, our ability to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes throughout the period of the liquidation process and other factors.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If our liabilities (including, without limitation, tax liabilities and compliance costs) are greater than we currently expect or if the sales prices of our assets are less than we expect, you will receive less in total liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, we are seeking to sell most or all of our assets and to pay most or all of the liquidating distributions, other than proceeds from the sale of our remaining interests in WWP, within 12 to 15 months of the Transition Date, although there is no assurance that all of our assets will be sold or final distributions will be made within that time period.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	repay the release amounts required to be paid upon property sales under the POL Loans, which may delay the timing of liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Additionally, our board of directors has discretion as to the timing of distributions of net sales proceeds.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	While we have previously provided estimates about the timing and amount of liquidating distributions that we will make, these estimates are based on multiple assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect, and the actual amount of liquidating distributions we pay to you may be more or less than these estimates.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P4_S3	We cannot assure you of the actual amount you will receive in liquidating distributions pursuant to the Liquidation Plan or when they will be paid.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If we are unable to find buyers for our assets on a timely basis or at our expected sales prices, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P4_S5	As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the 33 West 56 th Street Garage, the Viceroy Hotel and our remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza are the only assets remaining that are not subject to a binding sale agreement providing for their sale.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The sales prices that we will ultimately be able to obtain for our assets are subject to many variables.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	For example, in order to find buyers in a timely manner, we may be required to lower our asking price below the low end of our current estimate of the asset s market value.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If we are not able to find buyers for these assets in a timely manner or if we have overestimated the sales prices we will receive, our liquidating distributions to our stockholders would be delayed or reduced.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Furthermore, real estate sales prices are constantly changing and fluctuate with changes in interest rates, supply and demand dynamics, occupancy percentages, lease rates, the availability of suitable buyers, the perceived quality and dependability of income flows from tenants and a number of other factors, both local and national.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	In addition, the amount of transactional fees and expenses or unknown liabilities, if any, may adversely impact the net liquidation proceeds from our assets.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We may require additional capital to implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In December 2016, we entered into the POL Loans to repay the Credit Facility in full and provide $260.0 million in additional capital to exercise the WWP Option, which we exercised on June 1, 2017.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S2	It is possible we may require additional funds for other capital needs including capital expenditures, working capital and other expenses related to our properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S3	There is no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to implement the Liquidation Plan effectively.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If we need additional capital, we are unlikely to be able to access the capital markets and any failure to obtain financing to meet our capital needs, on favorable terms or at all, could reduce and delay the liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S5	We are dependent on our joint venture partner, which is the administrative member and has day-to-day control over the activities of Worldwide Plaza, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of a sale of Worldwide Plaza or that we will realize our estimated value.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Our largest investment, representing 1.0 million of the 1.7 million rentable square feet in our portfolio as of December 31, 2017, and 95.7% of the 1.1 million rental square footage after the sales closed in 2018, is our 50.1% equity interest in the joint venture that owns Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P6_S7	We estimate holding this investment up to November 2021.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	While we own a majority of the membership interests in Worldwide Plaza, under the Worldwide Plaza joint venture agreement, our joint venture partner, which is a joint venture between an affiliate of SL Green Realty Corp. and a private equity fund sponsored by RXR Realty LLC, is the manager of the joint venture and is responsible for day-to-day management of Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	consent of the Board of Managers, including the consent of Wendy Silverstein who is our designee on the Board of Managers, however, we do not have control of the day-to-day decisions to be made by Worldwide Plaza, and therefore we are dependent on our joint venture partners and there is a risk of impasse.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Additionally, under the joint venture agreement, we would lose approval rights relating to property-level major decisions for Worldwide Plaza if Wendy Silverstein ceased to serve on the Board of Managers and we did not appoint a replacement consented to by our joint venture partners, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, within 90 days.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Investments in joint ventures under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third party not involved.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Our joint venture partner may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Disputes between us and our joint venture partner may result in litigation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Consequently, actions by or disputes with our joint venture partner might result in subjecting us to additional risk.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition, in certain circumstances we may be liable for the actions of our joint venture partner or subject to dilution of our interest if we fail to make required capital contributions to the venture.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We have a right to transfer our membership interests in Worldwide Plaza to purchasers meeting certain qualifications, subject to a right of first offer to our joint venture partner.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If our interest is not sold prior to, commencing January 18, 2022, we and our joint venture partner also have the right to require the joint venture to market the property owned by it for sale, subject to a right of first offer to our joint venture partner.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Any transferee of our interest would acquire an interest subject to the same limitations on participation in the management of Worldwide Plaza that are applicable to us.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	There can be no assurance these limitations will not affect our ability to sell our interest in Worldwide Plaza or the amount we would receive on a sale.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition, we may determine that a sale of the property rather than our interest in Worldwide Plaza is the best way to maximize the value of our interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Because we do not have a right to initiate a sale of the property until 2022, a sale of the property could substantially delay the timing of our complete liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S6	In addition, we may be required to transfer our remaining assets to a liquidating entity by January 3, 2019, and the interests in the liquidating entity will generally not be transferable by our shareholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S7	Additionally, the existence of the right of first offers may delay our ability to sell the Worldwide Plaza property or our interest in Worldwide Plaza on terms and in the timeframe of our choosing and may diminish the price we receive on a sale.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S8	Our management has estimated that the value of Worldwide Plaza could increase to between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion by November 2021, our estimated sale date of this investment, as a result of actions to be taken through our joint venture.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S9	Our venture partners have jointly developed and recommended a capital budget, which we have agreed to.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S10	The timing on the sale of the property, and the ultimate value we receive from the sale, are subject to change.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S11	The capital plan includes targeted capital improvements aimed at maintaining the institutional quality of the building and an appropriate allocation to allow for critical tenant lease renewals and rolls.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S12	In addition, capital will be available for new management to focus on repositioning the property as a more modern asset, with a corresponding program to rebrand and likely rename the building as well as energizing and maximizing the potential of the retail and concourse space.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S13	We have set aside approximately $90.7 million from the refinancing proceeds to cover an estimate of our share of potential future leasing and capital costs at the property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P10_S14	Our joint venture partners have committed to contribute their pro-rata share of the budgeted capital investment.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Management s estimate, like any estimate or projection, is subject to various assumptions and uncertainties including the joint venture s ability to execute on the business plan, tenants paying their rental obligations, the equity capital and financing markets and New York City market conditions generally.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	There is no assurance that the joint venture will be successful in taking these various actions and that these actions will, in fact, result in the estimated increase in the value of the property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Our ability to sell the Worldwide Plaza property may be delayed by a right of first offer held by one of the tenants of the Worldwide Plaza property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	The lease with one of the tenants at the Worldwide Plaza property contains a right of first offer in the event that WWP is selling 100% of the property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The right requires that WWP offer the tenant the option to purchase 100% of the Worldwide Plaza property, at a price (and on other material terms) proposed by WWP prior to selling the Worldwide Plaza property to a third party.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If, after a 45-day period, that tenant does not accept the offer, WWP may then sell the Worldwide Plaza property to a third party, provided that WWP will be required to re-offer the property to that tenant if we desire to sell the Worldwide Plaza property for a purchase price (and other economic consideration) less than 92.5% of the initial purchase price contained in the offer to that tenant.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	The existence of this right of first offer may delay WWP s ability to sell the Worldwide Plaza property on terms and in the timeframe of our choosing and may diminish the price other potential purchasers may be willing to pay for the Worldwide Plaza property, which may reduce or delay the liquidating distributions that will be paid to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If we are unable to satisfy all of our obligations to creditors, or if we have underestimated our future expenses, the amount of liquidation proceeds will be reduced.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Pursuant to the Liquidation Plan, we intend to file articles of dissolution with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland ( SDAT ) promptly after the sale of all of our remaining assets or at such time as we have transferred our remaining assets, subject to our liabilities, into a liquidating entity.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Pursuant to Maryland law, we will continue to exist for the purpose of paying, satisfying and discharging any debts or obligations, collecting and distributing its assets, and doing all other acts required to liquidate and wind up its business and affairs.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We intend to pay for all liabilities and distribute all of our remaining assets, before we file our articles of dissolution.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Under Maryland law, certain obligations or liabilities imposed by law on our stockholders, directors, or officers cannot be avoided by the dissolution.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	For example, if we make distributions to our stockholders without making adequate provisions for payment of creditors claims, our stockholders could be liable to the creditors to the extent of any payments due to creditors.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The liability of any stockholder is, however, limited to the amounts previously received by such stockholder from us (and from any liquidating entity).
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Accordingly, in such event, a stockholder could be required to return all liquidating distributions previously paid to such stockholder and a stockholder could receive nothing from us under the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Moreover, in the event a stockholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received as a liquidating distribution, a repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a stockholder incurring a net tax cost if the stockholder s repayment of an amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Therefore, to the extent that we have underestimated the size of our contingency reserve and distributions to our stockholders have already been paid, our stockholders may be required to return some or all of such distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Decreases in property values may reduce the amount we receive upon sales of our assets, which would reduce the amount you receive in liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The Liquidation Plan provides for the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, all of which are real estate investments, and we cannot predict whether we will be able to do so at a price or on terms and conditions acceptable to us.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Investments in real properties are relatively illiquid.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The amount we receive upon sales of our assets depends on the underlying value of our assets, and the underlying value of our assets may be reduced by a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, without limitation, the following:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	changes in tax, real estate, environmental and zoning laws.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	In addition, because we will only own three properties following the sales completed to date in 2018 and the sale of properties under contract, any item which adversely affects an individual property will have a greater effect on the Company than it would if we owned more properties and were more diversified.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If our liquidation costs or unpaid liabilities are greater than we expect, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Before making the final liquidating distribution, we will need to pay or arrange for the payment of all of our transaction costs in the liquidation, all other costs and all valid claims of our creditors.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our board of directors may also decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us, for which we would pay a premium which has not yet been determined.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our board of directors may also decide to establish a reserve fund to pay these contingent claims.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, if the claims of our creditors are greater than we have anticipated, our liquidating distributions may be delayed or reduced from our estimates.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Further, if we decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us or a reserve fund is established, payment of liquidating distributions to our stockholders may be delayed or reduced.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Defaults under future sale agreements may delay or reduce liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In connection with implementing the Liquidation Plan, we will seek to enter into binding sale agreements for each of our remaining properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The consummation of the potential sales for which we will enter into sale agreements in the future will be subject to satisfaction of closing conditions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If any of the transactions contemplated by these future sale agreements do not close because of a buyer default, failure of a closing condition or for any other reason, we may not be able to enter into a new agreement on a timely basis or on terms that are as favorable as the original sale agreement.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any delay in the completion of asset sales could delay our payment of liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We will also incur additional costs involved in locating a new buyer and negotiating a new sale agreement for this asset.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	If we incur these additional costs, our liquidating distributions to our stockholders would be reduced.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Pursuing the Liquidation Plan may increase the risk that we will become liable for U.S. federal income and excise taxes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	our taxable income for the year (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain).
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	However, we are subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent that our taxable income exceeds the amount of dividends distributed to our stockholders for the taxable year.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which certain distributions paid by us with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that year, plus 95% of our capital gain net income for that year, plus 100% of our undistributed taxable income from prior years.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	While we intend to make distributions to our stockholders sufficient to avoid the imposition of any U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and the imposition of the excise tax, differences in timing between our actual cash flow and the recognition of our taxable income, could cause us to have to either borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the REIT distribution requirements, find another alternative for meeting the REIT distribution requirements, or pay U.S. federal income and excise taxes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition (and as discussed in more detail below), net income from the sale of properties that are dealer properties (a prohibited transaction under the Code) would be subject to a 100% excise tax.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	The cost of borrowing or the payment of U.S. federal income and excise taxes would reduce the amount of liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	The sale of our assets may cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on the net income from prohibited transactions, which would reduce the amount of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	REITs are subject to a 100% excise tax on any net income from prohibited transactions, which include sales or other dispositions of property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the REIT s trade or business which is not a foreclosure property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The determination of whether property is held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business is inherently factual in nature and, thus, cannot be predicted with certainty.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The Code provides a safe harbor which, if all its conditions are met, would protect a REIT s property sales from being considered prohibited transactions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	The conditions include, among other things, that the property be held by us for at least two years for the production of rental income and that we do not have more than seven property sales in any taxable year (there are alternative conditions to this seven sales condition, but those alternatives could not be met in the context of our complete liquidation).
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	With the exception of the additional interest in Worldwide Plaza acquired pursuant to the WWP Option, each of the properties we currently own has been held by us for at least two years for the production of rental income, and we may attempt to manage the timing of the sales of our properties so that we are able to meet the safe harbor in connection with the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	However, if we are to completely liquidate within 24 months of approval of the Liquidation Plan by our stockholders, it is possible that the IRS could take the position that we do not satisfy the safe harbor with respect to the portion of the Worldwide Plaza property we acquired through the exercise of the WWP Option.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	Regardless of whether a transaction qualifies for the safe harbor, we believe, but cannot assure you, that all of our properties are held for investment, should not be considered to be held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business (including our interest in the Worldwide Plaza property and the additional interest acquired through the exercise of the WWP Option) and we intend to structure our property sales pursuant to the Liquidation Plan in a manner that none of these sales will be subject to this tax.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	However, because of the number of properties that would have to be sold and the inability to meet the safe harbor with respect to at least a portion of the Worldwide Plaza property, there is a risk that the IRS could seek to treat some or all of the property sales as prohibited transactions resulting in the payment of taxes by us, in which case the amount of liquidating distributions to our stockholders could be significantly reduced.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Completing our liquidation by transferring any remaining assets to a liquidating trust or converting to a limited liability company may cause you to recognize taxable gain prior to the receipt of cash.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The REIT provisions of the Code generally require that each year we distribute as a dividend to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Liquidating distributions we make pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will qualify for the dividends paid deduction, provided that they are made within 24 months of the adoption of such plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Conditions may arise which cause us not to be able to liquidate within such 24-month period.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	For instance, it may not be possible to sell our assets at acceptable prices during such period.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In such event, rather than retain our assets and risk losing our status as a REIT, we intend, for tax purposes, to transfer our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust or, subject to the approval of our shareholders, convert to a limited liability company in order to meet the 24-month requirement.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	We may also elect to transfer our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust or, subject to the approval of our shareholders, convert to a limited liability company within such 24-month period to avoid the costs of operating as a public company.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Such a transfer or conversion would be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a distribution of our remaining assets and liabilities to our stockholders, immediately followed by a contribution of the assets and liabilities to the liquidating trust or limited liability company.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S7	As a result, you would recognize gain (or loss) in the tax year of such transfer or conversion equal to the difference between (x) your share of the cash and the fair market value of any assets received by the liquidating trust or limited liability company, less any liabilities assumed by the liquidating trust or limited liability company, and (y) your tax basis in your shares of our common stock (reduced by the amount of all prior liquidating distributions paid to you during the liquidation period), prior to the subsequent sale of such assets and the distribution to you of the net cash proceeds, if any.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S8	Whether you recognize gain (or loss) is determined separately for each block of shares of our common stock you acquired.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S9	Furthermore, for purposes of computing gain (or loss), the fair market value of any remaining assets (net of liabilities) may not necessarily correspond with our share price.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Such transfer or conversion also may have adverse tax consequences for tax-exempt and non-U.S. stockholders, including with respect to the on-going activity of the liquidating trust or limited liability company.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S11	In addition, it is possible that the fair market value of the assets received by the liquidating trust or limited liability company, as estimated for purposes of determining the extent of the stockholder s gain at the time interests in the liquidating trust or limited liability company are received by the stockholders, will exceed the cash and fair market value of property received by the liquidating trust or limited liability company on a sale of the assets.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S12	In this case, the stockholder would recognize a loss in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year in which the gain was recognized.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S13	The ability of stockholders to claim this loss may be limited.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S14	Our entity value may be adversely affected by the implementation of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S15	The implementation of the Liquidation Plan and our engaging in the process of winding-up our operations may dissuade parties that might have an interest in acquiring our company from pursuing such an acquisition and may, especially as the liquidation process progresses and draws closer to completion, also preclude other possible courses of action not yet identified by our board of directors.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S16	Our sale of assets may have reduced the likelihood of a party making an offer to acquire us at an entity-level for a value that exceeds what we could realize from individual asset sales.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P24_S17	Our board of directors may terminate or amend the Liquidation Plan without stockholder approval.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets or common stock by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale or other transaction involving us or (ii) if our board of directors determines, in exercise of its duties under Maryland law, after consultation with its advisor and its financial advisor (if applicable) or other third party experts familiar with the market for Manhattan office properties, that there is an adverse change in the market for Manhattan office properties that reasonably would be expected to adversely affect proceeding with the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	This power of termination may be exercised up to the time that the articles of dissolution have been accepted for record by the SDAT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, our board of directors may amend the Liquidation Plan without further action by our stockholders to the extent permitted under then current law.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Subject to the conditions described above, our board of directors may conclude either that its duties under applicable law require it to pursue business opportunities that present themselves or that abandoning the Liquidation Plan is otherwise in our best interests.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	If our board of directors elects to pursue any alternative to the Liquidation Plan, our stockholders will not receive any further liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Because liquidating distributions may be made in multiple tax years, if we were to abandon the Liquidation Plan in a tax year subsequent to one in which we already made liquidating distributions, the timing and character of your taxation with respect to liquidating distributions made to you in the prior tax year could change, which may subject you to tax liability (which tax liability could be at ordinary income rather than capital gains rates) in the prior tax year that you would not otherwise have been subject to, and we could lose our REIT status as of the beginning of such prior tax year.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	The U.S. federal income tax consequences of abandoning the Liquidation Plan are not entirely clear once we have begun making liquidating distributions, in particular because liquidating distributions could be made in multiple tax years during the 24 months we have for U.S. federal income tax purposes to complete our liquidation after the Liquidation Plan has been approved by our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	In general, distributions to you under the Liquidation Plan, including your pro rata share of the fair market value of any assets that are transferred to a limited liability company or a liquidating trust, should not be taxable to you for U.S. federal income tax purposes until the aggregate amount of liquidating distributions to you exceeds your adjusted tax basis in your shares of our common stock, and then should be taxable to you as capital gain or loss (assuming you hold your shares as a capital asset).
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	However, if we abandon the Liquidation Plan, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any liquidating distributions already made pursuant to the Liquidation Plan would change because they would no longer be treated as having been made as part of our complete liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Instead, any such distributions would be treated as either a dividend made with respect to the shares you hold, subject to the normal rules of U.S. federal income tax, the same as dividends you received prior to our adoption of the Liquidation Plan were subject to, or as payment to you for the sale or exchange of your shares in partial redemption of them.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S10	Whether sale or distribution treatment would apply to you depends on your particular circumstances and we cannot predict which would apply; however, regardless of which treatment would apply, each distribution likely would be at least be partially taxable to you.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S11	Accordingly, if we had made liquidating distributions in the tax year we adopted the Liquidation Plan which did not exceed your tax basis in your shares (and therefore were not taxable to you), and we abandoned the Liquidation Plan in the subsequent tax year, you may now have a tax liability with respect to the distributions made to you in the prior tax year, and, if they are treated as distributions rather than a sale or exchange, whether you are taxed at ordinary income or capital gains rates may depend on whether we had declared any portion of such distributions as capital gain dividends.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P25_S12	In addition, liquidating distributions we make pursuant to the Liquidation Plan qualify for the dividends paid deduction (which helps us ensure we meet our annual distribution requirement during our liquidation process), provided that they are made within 24 months of the adoption of such plan; however, if such distributions were no longer made pursuant to our complete liquidation within 24 months of the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, whether any part of such distributions qualify for the dividends paid deduction will depend on different criteria.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If we had made some liquidating distributions in one tax year and we abandoned the Liquidation Plan in the subsequent tax year, it is possible that we may not have made sufficient distributions in that first tax year to satisfy our annual distribution requirement for that tax year which, if we are unable to cure such failure, could result in the loss of our REIT status effective as of the beginning of that first tax year.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Stockholder litigation related to the Liquidation Plan could result in substantial costs and distract our management.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Historically, extraordinary corporate actions by a company, such as the Liquidation Plan, often lead to securities class action lawsuits being filed against that company.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We were already subject to a stockholder lawsuit, which has subsequently been dismissed on the basis of a provision in the Company s bylaws providing that the state or federal courts of Maryland are the sole and exclusive forum, and which could be appealed, that included claims related to the strategic alternatives process that led to the approval of the Liquidation Plan and may become subject to more of this type of litigation as a result of the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Defending ourselves in this litigation may be expensive and, even if we ultimately prevail, the process of defending against lawsuits will divert management s attention from implementing the Liquidation Plan and otherwise operating our business.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	If we do not prevail in any lawsuit, we may be liable for damages.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We cannot predict the amount of any such damages, however, if applicable, they may be significant and may cause liquidating distributions to our stockholders to be delayed.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Stockholders could be liable to creditors to the extent of liquidating distributions received if contingent reserves are insufficient to satisfy our liabilities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S6	If a court holds at any time that we have failed to make adequate provision for our expenses and liabilities or if the amount ultimately required to be paid in respect of such liabilities exceeds the amount available from the contingency reserve and the assets of the limited liability company or the liquidating trust, our creditors could seek an injunction to prevent us from making distributions under the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Any such action could delay or substantially diminish the cash distributions to be paid to stockholders or holders of beneficial interests of the limited liability company or the liquidating trust under the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S8	Our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S9	Under the rules of the NYSE, the exchange has discretionary authority to delist our common stock if we proceed with the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S10	In addition, the exchange may commence delisting proceedings against us if (i) the average closing price of our common stock falls below $1.00 per share over a 30-day consecutive trading period, (ii) our average market capitalization falls below $15.0 million over a 30-day consecutive trading period, or (iii) we lose our REIT qualification.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S11	Even if the NYSE does not move to delist our common stock, we may voluntarily delist our common stock from the NYSE in an effort to reduce our operating expenses and maximize our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S12	If our common stock is delisted, you may have difficulty trading your shares of our common stock on the secondary market, to the extent one develops or exists.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S13	Interests in a limited liability company in which the Company is converted or any liquidating trust we may establish pursuant to the Liquidation Plan will be generally non-transferable.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P27_S14	If we cannot sell our assets and pay our debts by January 3, 2019, the 24-month anniversary of stockholder approval of the Liquidation Plan, we intend, for tax purposes, to convert to a limited liability company, subject to approval of our shareholders, or transfer and assign our remaining assets and liabilities to a liquidating trust.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Any stockholders who have not sold their shares of common stock prior to this transfer and assignment will receive membership interests in the limited liability company or beneficial interests in the liquidating trust equivalent to their ownership interests in us as represented by the shares of our common stock they held prior to the transfer and assignment.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Membership interests in the limited liability company or beneficial interests in the liquidating trust will be generally non-transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Because of the illiquid nature of these interests, there can be no assurance as to how long any holder thereof may be required to hold them.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Risks Related to Our Properties and Operations All of our properties are located in the New York MSA, making us dependent upon the economic climate in New York City.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	All of the real estate assets we own are located in the New York MSA.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are subject to risks generally inherent in concentrating investments in a certain geography.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	These risks resulting from a lack of diversification may become even greater in the event of a downturn in the commercial real estate industry and could significantly adversely affect the value of our properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	A downturn in New York City s economy, in a submarket within New York City or in the overall national economy could, for example, result in reduced demand for office or lodging space.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Likewise, declines in the financial services or media sectors may have a disproportionate adverse effect on the New York City real estate market.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We believe that there has been a softening in the market for real estate in New York City which has affected and could continue to affect the proceeds from sales of our properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Because our portfolio includes commercial office buildings located in the New York MSA, which has a relatively large number of financial and professional services sector, significant job losses in the financial and professional services sector, may decrease demand for office space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We may be adversely affected by certain trends that reduce demand for office real estate.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Some businesses are rapidly evolving to increasingly permit employee telecommuting, flexible work schedules, open workplaces and teleconferencing.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	These practices enable businesses to reduce their space requirements.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	A continuation of the movement towards these practices could over time erode the overall demand for office space and, in turn, place downward pressure on occupancy, rental rates and property valuations.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We face significant competition for tenants.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property s design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do, which could limit our success when we compete with them directly.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Winthrop Advisor for tenants.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from other properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 We may be unable to renew leases or re-lease space as leases expire.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We may be unable to renew expiring leases on terms and conditions that are as, or more, favorable as the terms and conditions of the expiring leases.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	In addition, vacancies may occur at one or more of our properties due to a default by a tenant on its lease or expiration of a lease.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Vacancies may reduce the value of a property as a result of reduced cash flow generated by the property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In addition, changes in space utilization by our tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	If we are unable to promptly renew expiring leases or release the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or release the space, our cash flow and the amount of liquidating distributions we pay could be adversely affected.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	We also may experience a decrease in occupancy and rental rates accompanied by increases in the cost of re-leasing space (including for tenant improvements) and in uncollectible receivables.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Early lease terminations may significantly contribute to a decline in occupancy of our office properties and may adversely affect the value of the impacted property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	While lease termination fees increase current period income, future rental income may be diminished.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	During periods in which market rents decline, it is unlikely that we will collect from replacement tenants the full contracted amount which had been payable under the terminated leases.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S7	Tenant credit concentrations make us more susceptible to adverse events with respect to those tenants.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P36_S8	As of December 31, 2017, the following existing tenants represented 5% or more of our total annualized cash base rents:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	(1) Annualized cash base rent reflects our 50.1% pro rata share of rent generated by Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The financial failure of any or all of these tenants is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, the value of the applicable property or the amount or timing of liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, the value of our properties are driven in part by the credit quality of the underlying tenants, and an adverse change in the tenants financial conditions or a decline in the credit rating of such tenants may result in a decline in the value of our properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If a tenant declares bankruptcy, we may be unable to collect balances due under relevant leases.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Any of our tenants, or any guarantor of a tenant s lease obligations, could be subject to a bankruptcy proceeding pursuant to Title 11 of the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	A bankruptcy filing by one of our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant s lease obligations would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	There is no assurance the tenant or its trustee would agree to assume the lease.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have a general unsecured claim for damages and it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P38_S5	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P38_S6	A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments, which could adversely affect our financial condition or the amount or timing of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our ability to operate our business and implement the Liquidation Plan depends upon the participation of executive officers, and other key personnel of the Winthrop Advisor, and there is no assurance that the advisory agreement with the Winthrop Advisor (the Current Advisory Agreement ) will continue to be extended or that such officers and personnel will remain in place.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We are an externally managed company and have no employees of our own, and our ability to operate our business, including implementing the Liquidation Plan and otherwise operate on a day-to-day basis, will depend to a significant degree upon the contributions of our executive officers, and other key personnel of the Winthrop Advisor.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Personnel and services that we require are provided to us under contracts with an external advisor, and we are dependent on an external advisor to manage our operations and manage our real estate assets, including sale of our real estate assets.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	These responsibilities also include arranging financings, providing accounting services, providing information technology services, preparing and filing all reports required to be filed by it with the SEC, the IRS and other regulatory agencies, maintaining our REIT status, and maintaining our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ).
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	On February 28, 2018, the Company and the Winthrop Advisor entered into an amendment to the Current Advisory Agreement providing for a term ending March 31, 2018 and providing that the Current Advisory Agreement will automatically renew for a one month period on the expiration of any renewal term, unless terminated by either the Company or the Winthrop Advisor on 45 days notice before the expiration of any renewal term.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	In addition, the amendment provides that commencing March 1, 2018, the Company will reimburse the Winthrop Advisor for the compensation of Wendy Silverstein as chief executive officer of the Company or otherwise, in such amount as may be agreed to.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	The parties are continuing discussions as to the amount of compensation to be paid to Ms. Silverstein and reimbursed by the Company and the extension of the Current Advisory Agreement for a longer term.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S7	There can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached or that the Current Advisory Agreement will continue to be renewed.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S8	The termination of the Current Advisory Agreement or the loss of, or inability to retain, any key personnel of the Winthrop Advisor could adversely affect our business or our ability to successfully implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S9	Under the Current Advisory Agreement, on the Transition Date, we appointed Wendy Silverstein as our chief executive officer and John Garilli as our chief financial officer, but there can be no assurance that the Winthrop Advisor will otherwise be able to retain the services of Wendy Silverstein or other executive officers and other key personnel needed to successfully implement the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S10	Any adverse changes in the financial condition of, or our relationship with, the Winthrop Advisor could hinder our ability to successfully manage our operations and our portfolio of investments and implement our plan of liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P39_S11	Additionally, changes in ownership or management practices, the occurrence of adverse events affecting the Winthrop Advisor or its affiliates or other companies advised by the Winthrop Advisor and its affiliates could create adverse publicity and adversely affect us and our relationship with lenders, tenants or counterparties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our operating results are affected by economic and regulatory changes that have an adverse impact on the real estate market in general.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Our operating results are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real estate, including:

1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Uninsured losses relating to real property or excessively expensive premiums for insurance coverage would reduce our cash flows and our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Our general liability coverage, property insurance coverage and umbrella liability coverage on all our properties may not be adequate to insure against liability claims and provide for the costs of defense.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Similarly, we may not have adequate coverage against the risk of direct physical damage or to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Moreover, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Insurance risks associated with such catastrophic events could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S6	This risk is particularly relevant with respect to potential acts of terrorism.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S7	The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the TRIA ), under which the U.S. federal government bears a significant portion of insured losses caused by terrorism, will expire on December 31, 2020, and there can be no assurance that Congress will act to renew or replace the TRIA following its expiration.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S8	In the event that the TRIA is not renewed or replaced, terrorism insurance may become difficult or impossible to obtain at reasonable costs or at all, which may result in adverse impacts and additional costs to us.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S9	Changes in the cost or availability of insurance due to the non-renewal of the TRIA or for other reasons could expose us to uninsured casualty losses.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S10	If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully insured, the value of our assets will be reduced by any such uninsured loss, which would reduce our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S11	In addition, other than any working capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S12	Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, the amount of liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders would be negatively impacted.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S13	Additionally, mortgage lenders insist in some cases that commercial property owners purchase coverage against terrorism as a condition for providing mortgage loans.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S14	Accordingly, to the extent terrorism risk insurance policies are not available at reasonable costs, if at all, our ability to finance or refinance our properties could be impaired.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S15	In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P41_S16	We may not have adequate, or any, coverage for such losses.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence, civilian unrest, or war may affect the markets in which we operate our business and our profitability.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Our properties are located in the New York MSA which has experienced, and remains susceptible to, terrorist attacks.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P42_S2	In addition, any kind of terrorist activity or violent criminal acts, including terrorist acts against public institutions or buildings or modes of public transportation (including airlines, trains or buses) could have a negative effect on our business and the value of our properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P42_S3	More generally, any terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including armed conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the worldwide financial markets and economy including demand for properties and the availability of financing.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We are required to pay real property taxes in respect of our properties and such taxes may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	An increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and reduce the amount of liquidating distributions we make to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Costs of complying with governmental laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental matters and discovery of previously undetected environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect our operating results.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations (including those of foreign jurisdictions), a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The costs of removal or remediation could be substantial.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials into the air, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P44_S6	In addition, when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	As a result, the presence of significant mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property, which would adversely affect our operating results.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could materially adversely affect our business, the value of our properties or our results of operations and, consequently, the amounts available to make liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Some of these laws and regulations have been amended so as to require compliance with new or more stringent standards as of future dates.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws may require us to incur material expenditures.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material environmental liability.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There are costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the Disabilities Act ).
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our properties are subject to the Disabilities Act.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities that generally require that buildings and services, including restaurants and retail stores, be made accessible and available to people with disabilities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P48_S4	The Disabilities Act s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties, or, in some cases, an award of damages.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our business could suffer in the event the Winthrop Advisor or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations experiences system failures or cyber-incidents or a deficiency in cybersecurity.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Despite system redundancy, the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the internal information technology systems of the Winthrop Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations, we are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Any system failure or accident that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption to our business.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	A cyber-incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	More specifically, a cyber-incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can result in third parties gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As reliance on technology in our industry has increased, so have the risks posed to the systems of the Winthrop Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, the risk of a cyber-incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted attacks and intrusions evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The remediation costs and lost revenues experienced by a victim of a cyber-incident may be significant and significant resources may be required to repair system damage, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, loss of revenues and litigation, caused by any breaches.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In addition, a security breach or other significant disruption involving the IT networks and related systems of the Winthrop Advisor or any other party that provides us with services essential to our operations could:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	adversely impact our reputation among our tenants, guests at our hotel and investors generally.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Although the Winthrop Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, there can be no assurance that those measures will be sufficient, and any material adverse effect experienced by the Winthrop Advisor and other parties that provide us with services essential to our operations could, in turn, have an adverse impact on us.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest Employees of the Winthrop Advisor, including employees who will be our executive officers, face conflicts of interest related to the positions they hold with the Winthrop Advisor and its affiliates.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We are an externally managed company and have no employees.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Employees or consultants of the Winthrop Advisor who will provide services to us, including employees or consultants who will serve as our officers, also hold or may hold positions with the Winthrop Advisor and its affiliates and provide services with respect to other entities or with respect to other properties or businesses of the Winthrop Advisor and its affiliates, which could result in conflicts of interest.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The Winthrop Advisor and its affiliates or entities that they advise own properties, and may seek to acquire additional properties, in the New York metropolitan area.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Conflicts could result in actions or inactions by the Winthrop Advisor or employees or consultants of the Winthrop Advisor, including employees or consultants who will be our executive officers, that are detrimental to our business.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Conflicts with our business and interests are most likely to arise from involvement in activities related to (a) allocation of management time and services between us and the other entities, (b) terms and timing of sales of properties (c) the lease of vacant space or renewal of existing leases at our properties as compared to properties owned or managed by affiliates of the Winthrop Advisor, and (d) any decision to sell our company and abandon the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The Winthrop Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the structure of the fees they receive, which could result in actions that are not necessarily in the long-term best interests of our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Under the Current Advisory Agreement, the Winthrop Advisor is entitled to certain fees and other compensation which may result in its interests not being wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	For example, the Winthrop Advisor could be motivated to recommend certain actions that could increase the potential that it will earn incentive fees, but which may not be consistent with actions desired by our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P57_S3	These broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P57_S4	Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	all other risk factors addressed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We depend on our OP and its subsidiaries for cash flow and are structurally subordinated in right of payment to the obligations of our OP and its subsidiaries.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Our only significant asset is the general partnership interests we own in our OP and assets held by us for the use and benefit of our OP.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Accordingly, we rely on distributions from our OP and its subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flows.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	There is no assurance that our OP or its subsidiaries will be able to, or be permitted to, pay distributions to us that will enable us to pay our obligations.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Each of our OP s subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from these entities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	In addition, because we are a holding company, stockholder claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our OP and its subsidiaries.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S4	Therefore, in connection with implementing the Liquidation Plan or in the event of our bankruptcy or reorganization, our assets and those of our OP and its subsidiaries will be able to satisfy stockholder claims as stockholders only after all of our and our OP s and its subsidiaries liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S5	Our rights and the rights of our stockholders to recover claims against our officers and directors are limited, which could reduce recoveries against them if they cause us to incur losses.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S6	Subject to certain limitations set forth therein or under Maryland law, our charter provides that no director or officer will be liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages and requires us to indemnify our directors and our officers.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S7	he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S8	We and our stockholders also may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce recoveries against them.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S9	In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs or otherwise reimburse for losses incurred by our directors, officers, employees and agents, or the Advisor, the Winthrop Advisor and their respective affiliates in some cases pursuant to our agreements with them.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S10	The limit on the number of shares a person may own may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P59_S11	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Unless exempted by our board of directors, no person may own more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of the outstanding shares of our stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	This restriction may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets) that might provide a premium price for holders of our common stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Similarly, this restriction further limits a stockholder s ability to sell shares.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Maryland law prohibits certain business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us to be acquired.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Under Maryland law, business combinations between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	An interested stockholder is defined as:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he or she otherwise would have become an interested stockholder.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The business combination statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	The business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Maryland law limits the ability of a third-party to buy a large ownership interest in us and exercise voting power in electing directors, which may discourage a takeover that could otherwise result in a premium price to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P68_S4	Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers or by employees who are directors of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Control shares are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	A control share acquisition means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P70_S3	There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Retail Industry Risks Retail conditions may adversely affect our income.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	A total of 7% of our property holdings measured by rentable square feet as of December 31, 2017 is comprised of commercial retail properties located in the New York MSA.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	A retail property s revenues and value may be adversely affected by a number of factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our retail properties may be negatively impacted.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P72_S2	Some of our leases provide for base rent plus contractual base rent increases.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P72_S3	We also have leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant s sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Under those leases which contain contingent rent clauses, our revenue from tenants may increase as the sales of our tenants increase.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	As a result, the portion of our revenue which we derive from contingent rent leases could decline in a general economic downturn.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Our revenue will be impacted by the success and economic viability of our anchor retail tenants.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Our reliance on single or significant tenants in certain buildings may decrease our ability to lease vacated space.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	In the retail sector, any tenant occupying a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, a tenant of any of the triple-net single-user retail properties outside the primary geographical area of investment, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, or a tenant that is our anchor tenant at more than one retail center, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, or may decide not to renew its lease.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Any of these events would result in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition and could reduce or delay our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases permit cancellation or rent reduction if another tenant s lease is terminated.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We may own properties where the tenants may have rights to terminate their leases if certain other tenants are no longer open for business.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	These co-tenancy provisions also may exist in some leases where we own a portion of a retail property and one or more of the anchor tenants leases space in that portion of the center not owned or controlled by us.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	If such tenants were to vacate their space, tenants with co-tenancy provisions would have the right to terminate their leases with us or seek a rent reduction from us.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	In such event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S4	Similarly, the leases of some anchor tenants may permit the anchor tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S5	The transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S6	A lease transfer to a new anchor tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases at the retail center.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S7	If we are unable to re-lease the vacated space to a new anchor tenant, we may incur additional expenses in order to re-model the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S8	Competition with other retail channels may reduce our profitability.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P76_S9	Our retail tenants face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as retailing conducted through internet websites (which we refer to as e-commerce), discount shopping centers, outlet centers, upscale neighborhood strip centers, catalogues and other forms of direct marketing, discount shopping clubs and telemarketing.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	retail properties may compete with our retail properties for customers, affecting their tenants cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	In addition, some of our tenants rent payments may be based on the amount of sales revenue that they generate.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	If these tenants experience competition, the amount of their rent may decrease and our cash flow will decrease.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P77_S3	Moreover, the use of the internet by consumers continues to gain popularity and migration towards e-commerce is expected to continue.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P77_S4	This increase in internet sales could result in a downturn in the business of our current tenants in their brick and mortar locations and could affect the way future tenants lease space.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P77_S5	Our hotel is subject to all the risks common to the hotel industry and subject to market conditions that affect all hotel properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P77_S6	One of the properties we own is a hotel located in New York City that is subject to all the risks of the hotel industry, particularly the hotel industry in the New York MSA, which may include:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	adverse effects of international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	In addition, the hotel industry may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as extreme weather conditions or natural disasters, terrorist attacks or alerts, outbreaks of contagious diseases, airline strikes, economic factors and other considerations affecting travel.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 As a REIT, we cannot directly or indirectly operate our lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	We cannot and do not directly or indirectly operate our lodging property and instead rely on the ability of a third-party hotel management company to operate our lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	In order for us to satisfy certain REIT qualification rules, we cannot directly or indirectly operate any lodging property or actively participate in the decisions affecting its daily operations.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	The lodging property that we own is leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ), which has entered into a hotel management agreement with a third-party hotel management company to operate the property that we have leased to the TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S4	We cannot and do not control this third-party hotel management company, which is responsible for maintenance and other day-to-day management including, but not limited to, the implementation of significant operating decisions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S5	Thus, even if we believe our lodging property is being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory operating results, we may not be able to require the third-party hotel management company to change its method of operation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S6	Any negative publicity or other adverse developments that affect that operator generally may adversely affect the performance of our lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S7	We rely on the third-party hotel management company to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting at our lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S8	We do not, however, control the design or implementation of or changes to these internal controls.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S9	We may not be able to require the third-party hotel management company to change its internal control structure.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S10	This could require us to implement extensive and possibly inefficient controls at a parent level in an attempt to mitigate such deficiencies.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S11	If such controls are not effective, the accuracy of the results of our operations that we report could be affected.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S12	Accordingly, our ability to conclude that, as a company, our internal controls are effective is significantly dependent upon the effectiveness of internal controls that our third-party hotel management company has implemented at our lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S13	It is possible that we could have a significant deficiency or material weakness as a result of the ineffectiveness of the internal controls at our lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S14	If we replace the third-party hotel management company, we may be required by the terms of the relevant management agreement to pay substantial termination fees, and we may experience significant disruptions at our lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S15	We may not be able to make arrangements with a third-party hotel management company with substantial prior lodging experience in the future and could experience disruptions in our operations.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S16	Our use of the TRS structure increases our expenses.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P79_S17	A TRS structure subjects us to the risk of increased lodging operating expenses.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The performance of any TRS is based on the operations of the applicable lodging property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	Our operating risks include not only changes in hotel revenues and changes to our TRS s ability to pay the rent due to us under the leases, but also increased hotel operating expenses, including, but not limited to, the following cost elements:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 There are risks associated with employing hotel employees.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P81_S1	We are generally subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel employees.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Our lodging property is leased to a TRS, which entered into a hotel management agreement with a third-party hotel management company to operate the lodging properties that we lease to the TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P81_S3	Hotel operating revenues and expenses for this property are included in our consolidated results of operations.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P81_S4	As a result, although we do not directly employ or manage the labor force at our lodging properties, we are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Our third-party property manager is responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at our lodging property and for establishing and maintaining the appropriate processes and controls over such activities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P82_S1	From time to time, the operations of our lodging property may be disrupted through strikes, public demonstrations or other labor actions and related publicity.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P82_S2	We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of the aforementioned disruptions, or contract disputes or other events.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P82_S3	Our third-party property manager may be targeted by union actions or adversely impacted by the disruption caused by organizing activities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P82_S4	We have outstanding debt, and the amount of debt and its cost may increase and refinancing may not be available on acceptable terms.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Our business is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P83_S1	The total principal amount of our combined outstanding indebtedness, which generally comprises mortgage loans secured by our properties, our pro rata share of Worldwide Plaza s indebtedness and our other mortgage and mezzanine indebtedness was $816.7 million as of December 31, 2017.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	We may borrow additional funds if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualification requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P84_S2	We may be unable to obtain debt financing or refinance existing indebtedness upon maturity.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P84_S3	Our substantial indebtedness and the cash flow associated with serving our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the risks that:
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing (such as the possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans) may result in higher interest rates, which could adversely affect net income, cash flow and our ability to service debt and pay liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P85_S1	In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P85_S2	In that case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of an investment in our common stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P85_S3	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P85_S4	If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash proceeds.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P85_S5	In such event, we may be unable to pay the amount of dividends required in order to maintain our REIT status.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	If we provide a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, a default on a single property could affect multiple properties.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	If any of our properties are foreclosed upon due to a default, our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected which could result in our losing our REIT status and would result in a decrease in the amount of liquidating distributions we will be able to pay.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Covenants in the instruments governing our existing indebtedness could limit our operational and financial flexibility or result in covenant breaches.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	The POL Loans contain operating covenants and covenants related to maintaining minimum net worth and liquid assets that could limit our financial and operational flexibility.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	In addition, we will be unable to pay liquidating distributions until we repay the release amounts required to be paid upon property sales under the POL Loans, which may delay the timing of liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	The other mortgage loans we have include certain property-level financial covenants including debt service coverage ratios covenants, as well as transfer restrictions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	The mortgages relating to many of the properties we have acquired include restrictions, such as prepayment penalties or assumption fees, that could affect our ability to sell properties or the net proceeds we would realize upon a sale.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S2	These covenants may negatively impact our ability to complete sales of our assets or the timing and amount of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S3	If we fail to satisfy those covenants, we would be in default and may be required to repay our indebtedness with capital from other sources.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S4	Under such circumstances, other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on unattractive terms.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S5	Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and reduce the amount of liquidating distributions we pay to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S6	We have incurred substantial indebtedness, of which $215.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017, among other things, bears interest at variable interest rates.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S7	As of December 31, 2017 we are not party to any interest rate caps or swaps.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S8	Accordingly, increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P89_S9	In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S0	Our failure to remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and potentially state and local tax, and would adversely affect our operations and reduce the amount of our liquidating distributions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S1	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT until we have completed our liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S2	However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in our best interests, or inadvertently.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S3	Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S4	The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S5	Furthermore, any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) and is not a guarantee that we will qualify, or continue to qualify, as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S6	Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can remain qualified as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S7	Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S8	Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S9	Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S10	Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S11	If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate rate.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S12	In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P90_S13	Losing our REIT qualification would reduce our net earnings available for distribution to stockholders, including liquidating distributions, because of the additional tax liability.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P91_S0	Even though we qualify as a REIT, in certain circumstances, we may incur tax liabilities that would reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P91_S1	Even though we qualify and to the extent we maintain our status as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P91_S2	For example, net income from the sale of properties that are dealer properties sold by a REIT (a prohibited transaction under the Code) will be subject to a 100% tax.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P91_S3	We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P91_S4	We also will be subject to corporate tax on any undistributed REIT taxable income.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P91_S5	We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property, including franchise, payroll and transfer taxes, either directly or at the level of our OP or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets, such as our TRS, which are subject to full U.S. federal, state, local and foreign corporate-level income taxes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P91_S6	Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available for other purposes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P92_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 To maintain our qualification as a REIT we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P92_S1	In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P92_S2	We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which dividends we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P92_S3	It is possible that we might not be able to pay distributions sufficient to meet the annual distribution requirements and to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes on our earnings in order to continue to qualify as a REIT during our liquidation process.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P92_S4	Our TRS is subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our TRS may be subject to 100% excise tax.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P93_S0	A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P93_S1	Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P93_S2	A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P93_S3	Overall, no more than 20% (25% for our taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2018) of the gross value of a REIT s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P94_S0	A TRS may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a REIT, including gross income from operations pursuant to management contracts.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P94_S1	We will lease any qualified lodging facilities we own to one or more TRS which in turn contract with independent third-party hotel management companies to operate such qualified lodging facilities on behalf of such TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P95_S0	We may use our TRS generally for other activities as well, such as to hold properties for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business or to hold assets or conduct activities that we cannot conduct directly as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P96_S0	A TRS will be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax on its taxable income.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P96_S1	In addition, the rules, which are applicable to us as a REIT, also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm s-length basis.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P96_S2	If our leases to our TRS are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P97_S0	To qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income tests, under which specified percentages of our gross income must be derived from certain sources, such as rents from real property.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P97_S1	In order for rent to qualify as rents from real property for purposes of the REIT gross income tests, the leases must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P97_S2	If our leases are not respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would fail to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P97_S3	If our OP failed to qualify as a partnership or is not otherwise disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P97_S4	We intend to maintain the status of our OP as a partnership or a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P97_S5	However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of our OP as a partnership or disregarded entity for such purposes, it would be taxable as a corporation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S0	amount of distributions that our OP could make to us.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S1	This also would result in our failing to qualify as a REIT, and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our income.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S2	This substantially would reduce our cash available to pay liquidating distributions and the yield on an investment in our common stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S3	In addition, if any of the partnerships or limited liability companies through which our OP owns its properties, in whole or in part, loses its characterization as a partnership and is otherwise not disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing distributions to the OP.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S4	Such a recharacterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain our REIT qualification.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S5	Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S6	The REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our liabilities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S7	Any income from a hedging transaction we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or in certain cases to hedge previously acquired hedges entered into to manage risks associated with property that has been disposed of or liabilities that have been extinguished, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, does not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S8	To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S9	As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S10	This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P98_S11	In addition, losses in a TRS generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such TRS.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P99_S0	The ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT qualification without stockholder approval may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and reduce liquidating distributions to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P99_S1	Our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P99_S2	While we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we may terminate our REIT election if we determine that qualifying as a REIT is no longer in our best interests.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P99_S3	If we cease to be a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P99_S4	We may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could increase our tax liability, reduce our operating flexibility and reduce the market price of our common stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P100_S0	In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to investments similar to an investment in shares of our common stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P100_S1	Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and there can be no assurance that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P100_S2	Any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P100_S3	Stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor with respect to the impact of recent legislation on their investment in our shares and the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P101_S0	advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a corporation.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P101_S1	As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a regular corporation, without the vote of our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P101_S2	Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P101_S3	The share ownership restrictions of the Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in our charter may inhibit market activity in our shares of stock and restrict our business combination opportunities.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S0	In order to qualify as a REIT, five or fewer individuals, as defined in the Code, may not own, actually or constructively, more than 50% in value of our issued and outstanding shares of stock at any time during the last half of each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S1	Attribution rules in the Code determine if any individual or entity actually or constructively owns our shares of stock under this requirement.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S2	Additionally, at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares of stock during at least 335 days of a taxable year for each taxable year, other than the first year for which a REIT election is made.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S3	To help ensure that we meet these tests, among other purposes, our charter restricts the acquisition and ownership of our shares of stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S4	Our charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT while we so qualify.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S5	Unless exempted by our board of directors, for so long as we qualify as a REIT, our charter prohibits, among other limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock, any person from beneficially or constructively owning (applying certain attribution rules under the Code) more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock and more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of any class or series of our shares of stock.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S6	Our board of directors may not grant an exemption from these restrictions to any proposed transferee whose ownership in excess of the 9.8% ownership limit would result in the termination of our qualification as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S7	These restrictions on transferability and ownership will not apply, however, if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT or that compliance with the restrictions is no longer required in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S8	These ownership limits could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P102_S9	Non-U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on liquidating distributions received from us and upon the disposition of our shares.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P103_S0	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 ( FIRPTA ) and other guidance by the IRS, liquidating distributions to the extent attributable to sales or exchanges of U.S. real property interests ( USRPIs ) generally will be taxed to a non-U.S. stockholder (other than a qualified pension plan, entities wholly owned by a qualified pension plan and certain foreign publicly traded entities) as if such gain were effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P103_S1	However, liquidating distributions will not be treated as effectively connected income if (a) the dividend is received with respect to a class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and (b) the non-U.S. stockholder does not own more than 10% of the class of our stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date the liquidating distribution is received.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P104_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Gain recognized by a non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale or exchange of our common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI under FIRPTA.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P104_S1	Our common stock will not constitute a USRPI so long as we are a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity .
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P104_S2	A domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT if at all times during a specified testing period, less than 50% in value of such REIT s stock is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P104_S3	We believe, but cannot assure you, that we will be a domestically- controlled qualified investment entity.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P104_S4	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells or exchanges our common stock, gain arising from such a sale or exchange would not be subject to U.S. taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if (a) our common stock is regularly traded, as defined by applicable Treasury regulations, on an established securities market, and (b) such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 10% or less of our common stock at any time during the five-year period ending on the date of the sale.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P105_S0	Potential characterization of dividends or gain on sale may be treated as unrelated business taxable income to tax- exempt investors.
1474464_18_ITEM1A_P105_S1	If (a) we are a pension-held REIT, (b) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred (or is deemed to have incurred) debt to purchase or hold our common stock, or (c) a holder of common stock is a certain type of tax-exempt stockholder, dividends on, and gains recognized on the sale of, common stock by such tax-exempt stockholder may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Code.

1474464_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	These audited financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Overview On August 22, 2016 our Board of Directors (the Board ) approved a plan of liquidation to sell in an orderly manner all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of the OP (the Liquidation Plan ), subject to stockholder approval.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The Liquidation Plan was approved at a special meeting of stockholders on January 3, 2017.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Liquidation Plan provides for an orderly sale of our assets, payment of our liabilities and other obligations and the winding down of operations and the dissolution of the Company.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S3	We are not permitted to make any new investments except to exercise our option (the WWP Option ) to purchase additional equity interests in our WWP Holdings, LLC ( Worldwide Plaza ) venture or to make protective acquisitions on advances with respect to our existing assets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S4	We are permitted to satisfy any existing contractual obligations and pay for required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at our real estate properties, including real estate properties owned by joint ventures in which we own an interest.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S5	The Liquidation Plan enables us to sell any and all of our assets without further approval of the stockholders and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the stockholders as determined by the Board.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S6	Pursuant to applicable REIT rules, we must complete the disposition of our assets by January 3, 2019, two years after the date the Liquidation Plan was approved by the stockholders, in order to deduct liquidating distributions as dividends.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S7	In order to comply with applicable tax laws, the Company will be converted into a limited liability company or any of our assets not sold by January 3, 2019, will be distributed into a liquidating trust.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P3_S8	If the Company will be converted into a limited liability company or we transfer our assets to a liquidating trust, holders of our common shares will receive beneficial interests in the liquidating entity equivalent to those held in the Company.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	transferable, interests in the liquidating entity will generally not be transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Therefore, the recipients of the interests in the liquidating entity will not have the ability to realize any value from these interests except from distributions made by the liquidating entity, the timing of which will be solely in the discretion of the liquidating entity s trustees.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	As compared to the Company which is required to comply with all of the filing requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for publicly traded entities, based on current guidance provided by the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to liquidating trusts, the liquidating entity may be required to file only annual reports containing unaudited financial statements on Form 10-K and current reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions to stockholders involves risks and uncertainties.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the timing or aggregate amount which will be ultimately distributed to stockholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	We expect to continue to qualify as a REIT throughout the liquidation until such time as any remaining assets, if any, are transferred into a liquidating entity.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	The Board is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to cause us to maintain the Company s REIT status, provided however, the Board may elect to terminate our status as a REIT if they determine that such termination would be in the best interest of the stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	Although we expect that our common stock will continue to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange until our assets are either disposed of or transferred to a liquidating entity, under New York Stock Exchange rules, it is possible that following the implementation of the Liquidation Plan and prior to the disposition of all of the assets that the common shares could be delisted.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	On June 1, 2017 we closed on our acquisition of the additional interest in Worldwide Plaza, which is further discussed below.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S6	We have been actively marketing for sale, all of the remaining properties other than the remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S7	As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of our assets have been sold or are under binding contracts for sale, except for 33 West 56 th Street, The Viceroy Hotel and our remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S8	Our current estimates of net assets in liquidation, presented on an undiscounted basis, are based on an expectation that all of our properties will be sold by June 30, 2018, except for the remaining interest in Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S9	For purposes of liquidation accounting, our estimate of net assets in liquidation value assumes a sale of Worldwide Plaza at December 31, 2018 based on a value of $1.725 billion.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S10	These estimates are subject to change based on the actual timing of future asset sales.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S11	The net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017 are presented on an undiscounted basis and does not include Management s estimated future increase in value from the planned investment in the repositioning of Worldwide Plaza.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S12	Our current estimate of the liquidation value of investments in real estate includes Worldwide Plaza at $1.725 billion which is based on a current market transaction associated with our sale of a 48.7% interest in the property on October 18, 2017 discussed in Note 6.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S13	Our venture partners have jointly developed and recommended a capital budget, which we have agreed to.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S14	The timing of the sale of the property, and the ultimate value we receive from the sale, are subject to change.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P6_S15	The capital plan includes targeted capital improvements aimed at maintaining the institutional quality of the building and an appropriate allocation to allow for critical tenant lease renewals and rolls.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	repositioning the property as a more modern asset, with a corresponding program to rebrand and likely rename the building as well as energizing and maximizing the potential of the retail and concourse space.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We have set aside approximately $90.7 million from the refinancing proceeds to cover an estimate of our share of potential future leasing and capital costs at the property.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	Our joint venture partners have committed to contribute their pro-rata share of the budgeted capital investment.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S3	Management believes that the combined team of SL Green and RXR Realty will add the necessary talent, expertise and capital, along with the capital contributed by us, to bring this Class A asset with its blue chip tenant roster to its full potential.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S4	Management believes that implementation of the business plan for Worldwide Plaza will take at least two years and may take up to four years given the size of the building, which is a little over 2 million square feet, the scope and nature of the capital investment and to allow time for the critical milestones in leasing and asset repositioning to take place.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S5	Management believes that if these actions are successful, the estimated value of the property could increase to between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, on an undiscounted basis, by November 2021, our estimated sale date of this investment.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S6	Assuming additional investment in Worldwide Plaza of $64.0 million, plus a corresponding investment from our joint venture partners, a future value for Worldwide Plaza between $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion would produce a residual value between $2.19 and $2.77 per share, an increase of $0.32 to $0.90 per share over our current carrying value.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S7	In addition, we have contractual rents which generate a predictable cash flow from Worldwide Plaza during the estimated four-year hold period which, net of expenses, we estimate would produce an additional $0.43 per share over the four year hold period versus the $0.13 currently accrued.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P7_S8	These estimates of potential future cash flow are undiscounted.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Management s estimate, like any estimate or projection, is subject to various assumptions and uncertainties including the joint venture s ability to execute on the business plan, tenants paying their rental obligations, the equity capital and financing markets and New York City market conditions generally.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	There is no assurance that the joint venture will be successful in taking these various actions and that these actions will, in fact, result in the estimated increase in the value of the property.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Current Activity Subsequent to the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation, excluding the partial sale of Worldwide Plaza, the Company sold six properties for an aggregate purchase price of $1.325 billion during 2017 and five properties for an aggregate purchase price of $361.9 million to date in 2018.

1474464_18_ITEM7_P26_S2	These amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes, among other items.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Comparability of Financial Data From Period to Period Under going concern accounting, the comparability of financial data from period to period was affected by several items including (i) the timing of our property acquisition and leasing activity; (ii) the timing of property sales; (iii) when material impairment losses on assets are taken; and (iv) fluctuations in the fair value of our OP units and restricted shares.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Results of Operations In light of the adoption of liquidation basis accounting as of January 1, 2017, the results of operations for the current year is not comparable to the prior year.

1474464_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	Changes in Net Assets in Liquidation A summary of the change in net asset value for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows:
1474464_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The net assets in liquidation at December 31, 2017, which are presented on an undiscounted basis, includes Worldwide Plaza valued at $1.725 billion which is based on the recent sale of a 48.7% interest in the property as discussed in Note 6 and excludes Management s estimate of the future increase in value from the planned investment in the repositioning of Worldwide Plaza, resulting in liquidating distributions of approximately $4.96 per common share of which $2.00 per common share was distributed to stockholders on January 26, 2018.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P32_S2	This estimate of liquidating distributions includes projections of costs and expenses to be incurred during the period required to complete the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	As of October 18, 2017, Worldwide Plaza is managed by a joint venture of SL Green and RXR Realty, two of the largest owner operators in New York City.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	We, along with our new joint venture partners, are committed to investing significant additional capital into Worldwide Plaza to further improve and reposition the asset which we believe includes embedded opportunities to roll leases to increase the value of the property.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	We believe that once the actions are implemented and come to fruition, the value of Worldwide Plaza will range from $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion by our anticipated sale date of November 2021.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	The increase in the future market value of Worldwide Plaza will be reflected in the Statement of Net Assets in liquidation as the specific actions related to the repositioning have been completed and such increases in market value can be observed.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	assets in liquidation, on an undiscounted basis, of $5.58 per share as of December 31, 2017.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	This amount is inclusive of the $2.00 per share that was paid to stockholders on January 26, 2018.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Management s estimate, like any estimate or projection, is subject to various assumptions and uncertainties including the joint venture s ability to execute on the business plan, tenants paying their rental obligations, the equity capital and financing markets and New York City market conditions generally.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	There is no assurance that the joint venture will be successful in taking these various actions and that these actions will, in fact, result in the estimated increase in the value of the property.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Our audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared on the liquidation basis of accounting and accordingly include an estimate of the liquidation value of our assets and other estimates, including estimates of anticipated cash flow, timing of asset sales and liquidation expenses.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	These estimates update estimates that we have previously provided.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	These estimates are based on multiple assumptions, some of which may prove to be incorrect, and the actual amount of liquidating distributions we pay to you may be more or less than these estimates.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	We cannot assure you of the actual amount or timing of liquidating distributions you will receive pursuant to the Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Election as a REIT We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	We believe that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	We intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S4	If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S5	Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S6	Inflation Many of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S7	These provisions generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases either at fixed rates or indexed escalations (based on the Consumer Price Index or other measures).
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S8	We may be adversely impacted by inflation on the leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S9	In addition, our net leases require the tenant to pay its allocable share of operating expenses, which may include common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes and insurance.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S10	This may reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P38_S11	We have no off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	Prior to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, our most sensitive estimates involved the allocation of the purchase price of acquired properties, evaluating our real estate investments for impairment, and valuing our OP and LTIP units.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, we are required to estimate all costs and income we expect to incur and earn through the end of liquidation including the estimated amount of cash we expect to collect on the disposal of our assets and the estimated costs to dispose of our assets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Revenue Recognition Prior to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, we accounted for our leases with tenants as operating leases with rental revenue recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	Because many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) required us to record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that we would only receive if the tenant made all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P40_S3	We deferred the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P40_S4	When we acquired a property, the acquisition date was considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	Rental revenue recognition commenced when the tenant took possession or control of the physical use of the leased space.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	For the tenant to take possession, the leased space had to be substantially ready for its intended use.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	To determine whether the leased space was substantially ready for its intended use, we evaluated whether we, or the tenant, owned the tenant improvements.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	When we were the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition began when the tenant took possession of the finished space, which was when such improvements were substantially complete.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P42_S2	When we concluded that the tenant was the owner of tenant improvements, rental revenue recognition began when the tenant took possession of or controlled the space.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P42_S3	When we concluded that we are the owner of tenant improvements, we capitalized the cost to construct the tenant improvements, including costs paid for or reimbursed by the tenants.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P42_S4	When we concluded that the tenant was the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes, we recorded our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive, which was included in deferred leasing costs, net on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and amortized as a reduction to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	Under liquidation accounting, we have accrued all income that we expect to earn through the end of liquidation to the extent we have a reasonable basis for estimation.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	These amounts are classified in liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation on the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	In accordance with liquidation accounting, as of January 1, 2017, tenant and other receivables were adjusted to their net realizable values.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	We continually review tenant and other receivables to determine collectability.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	Any changes in the collectability of the receivables is reflected in the net realizable value of the receivable.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Under going concern accounting, unbilled rent receivable included the difference between straight line rent and contractual amounts due.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	We reviewed unbilled rent receivables monthly for collectability.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	receivable is not contemplated under liquidation accounting.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	We accrue rental revenue based on contractual amounts expected to be collected during liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We own certain properties with leases that include provisions for the tenant to pay contingent rental income based on a percent of the tenant s sales upon the achievement of certain sales thresholds or other targets which may be monthly, quarterly or annual targets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	As the lessor to the aforementioned leases, under going concern accounting we deferred the recognition of contingent rental income until the specified target that triggered the contingent rental income was achieved, or until such sales upon which percentage rent is based were known.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	Contingent rental income earned was included in rental income on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Contingent rental income is not contemplated under liquidation accounting unless we have a reasonable basis to estimate future receipts.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	Our hotel revenues are recognized as earned and are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for telephone service, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Investments in Real Estate Prior to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, we evaluated the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction was a business combination or asset acquisition.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	If an acquisition qualified as a business combination, the related transaction costs were recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of operations.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	If an acquisition qualified as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs were generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	In business combinations, we allocated the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities and non-controlling interests based on their respective estimated fair values.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	Tangible assets included land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	Intangible assets or liabilities included the value of in-place leases, above- and below-market leases and other identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on lease or property specific characteristics.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease was determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the as-if-vacant value was then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	The fair value of in-place leases was determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S5	The fair value of above- or below-market leases was recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the comparable fair market lease rate, measured over the remaining term of the lease.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S6	The fair value of other intangible assets, such as real estate tax abatements, were recorded based on the present value of the expected benefit and amortized over the expected useful life including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P53_S7	Fair values of assumed mortgages, if applicable, were recorded as debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which was calculated to account for either above- or below-market interest rates.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 We utilized a number of sources in making our estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	We also considered information and other factors including: market conditions, the industry in which the tenant operates, characteristics of the real estate such as location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	As of January 1, 2017, the investments in real estate were adjusted to their estimated net realizable value, or liquidation value, to reflect the change to the liquidation basis of accounting.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	The liquidation value represents the estimated amount of cash we expect to collect on the disposal of our assets as we carry out our Liquidation Plan.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P55_S2	The liquidation value of our investments in real estate are presented on an undiscounted basis.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P55_S3	Estimated costs to dispose of these assets are presented separately from the related assets.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P55_S4	Subsequent to January 1, 2017, all changes in the estimated liquidation value of the investments in real estate are reflected as a change in our undiscounted net assets in liquidation.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P55_S5	The liquidation value of real estate investments is determined by considering projected operating cash flows, sales of comparable assets, if any, and replacement costs among other measures.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P55_S6	The methods used to estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the discounted cash flow method, sales approach and/or third party information such as appraisals and sale offers to the extent available.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Depreciation and Amortization Under going concern accounting, depreciation was computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five to seven years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Under liquidation accounting, investments in real estate are no longer depreciated.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Under going concern accounting, acquired above-market leases were amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	Acquired below-market leases were amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	Acquired above-market ground leases were amortized as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P57_S4	Acquired below- market ground leases were amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining term of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option period.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P57_S5	The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above- and below-market in-place leases, was amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P57_S6	Assumed mortgage premiums or discounts, if applicable, were amortized as a reduction or increased to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Under liquidation accounting, intangible assets and liabilities are included in the liquidation value of investments in real estate and are no longer amortized.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	Impairment of Long Lived Assets Under going concern accounting, when circumstances indicated the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we reviewed the asset for impairment.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P59_S1	This review was based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P59_S2	These estimates considered factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P59_S3	If such estimated cash flows were less than the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss was recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the property.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	We used derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our borrowings.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	The principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	As of December 31, 2017, we did not hold any derivative instruments.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	Prior to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan, all derivatives were carried on the balance sheet at fair value.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depended on the intended use of the derivative, whether we elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P61_S2	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P61_S3	Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	If we designated a qualifying derivative as a hedge, changes in the value of the derivative were reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	If a derivative did not qualify as a hedge, or if we did not elect to apply hedge accounting, changes in the value of the derivative were reflected in other income (loss) on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
1474464_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	There are no new accounting pronouncements that are applicable or relevant to the Company under the liquidation basis of accounting.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Our mortgage debt, which consists of secured financings, bears interest at fixed rates and variable rates.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S2	From time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, caps, collars and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S3	We do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S4	We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S5	As of December 31, 2017, our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate debt.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S6	We had fixed-rate secured mortgage notes payable with an aggregate carrying value of $19.0 million and a fair value of $20.4 million.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S7	Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the notes, but it has no impact on interest due on the notes.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P67_S8	For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2017 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $0.7 million.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $0.7 million.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P68_S3	As of December 31, 2017, our variable-rate debt had a carrying and fair value of $196.5 million.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P68_S4	Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate debt affects interest expense incurred and cash flow.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	The sensitivity analysis related to our variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their December 31, 2017 levels, with all other variables held constant.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate debt would increase or decrease our interest expense by $2.0 million annually.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P69_S2	These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P69_S3	As the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of December 31, 2017, it does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P69_S4	The information represented herein has limited predictive value.
1474464_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations.

1474464_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The term internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the issuer s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the issuer s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
1474464_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1474464_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	FORM 10-K DECEMBER 31, 2017 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1474464_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1474464_18_ITEM9A_P5_S0	In the course of preparing this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the consolidated financial statements included herein, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) .
1474464_18_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Based on that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
1474464_18_ITEM9A_P5_S2	During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
