906709_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	With our expertise as a leader in the PEGylation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include first-generation PEGylation as well as new advanced polymer conjugate chemistries that can be tailored in very specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules including many classes of drugs useful in many disease areas.
906709_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	The majority of PEGylated drugs approved over the last fourteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of pharmaceutical companies.
906709_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology since PEG (polyethylene glycol) is a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that is safely cleared from the body.
906709_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties.
906709_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches used with biologics.
906709_11_ITEM1_P12_S3	Earlier PEGylation approaches were limited, in that they could not be used successfully to improve small molecule drugs, antibody fragments and peptides, all of which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology.
906709_11_ITEM1_P12_S4	Other limitations of the early approaches of PEGylation technology include resulting sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in PEGylation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	Both our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are outlined below:
906709_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our customized approaches for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that havelow bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, increased oral bioavailability, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	A primary example of the application of membrane transport inhibition, specifically reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-118 (oral PEG-naloxol), a novel peripheral opioid antagonist that completed Phase 2 clinical development in 2009.
906709_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	An example of a drug candidate that uses this approach to avoid first-pass metabolism is NKTR-140, a protease inhibitor in the early stages of discovery research.
906709_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase both its efficacy and side effect profile.
906709_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy.
906709_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	With our technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	We are using this approach with the two oncolytic candidates in our pipeline, NKTR-102, a topoisomerase I inhibitor-polymer conjugate currently in Phase 2 clinical development, and NKTR-105, a polymer conjugate form of docetaxel that is currently in Phase 1 clinical development.
906709_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	We are using our advanced polymer conjugation technology-based approach to enable peptides, which are much smaller in size than other biologics, such as proteins and antibody fragments.
906709_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	We are in the early stages of discovery research with a number of peptides that utilize this proprietary approach.
906709_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	Peptides are important in modulating many physiological processes in the body.
906709_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Some of the benefits of working with peptides are: they are small, more easily optimized, and can be rapidly investigated for therapeutic potential.
906709_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	However, peptide drug discovery has been slowed by the extremely short half-life and limited bioavailability of these molecules.
906709_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed a novel hydrolyzable linker that can be used to optimize the bioactivity of a peptide.
906709_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Through rational drug design and the use of our approach, a peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	The approach can also be used with proteins and larger molecules.
906709_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	This approach uses a large molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	(certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease in the U.S. and Rheumatoid Arthritis in the U.S. and Europe.
906709_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	To support this strategy, over the past three years we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of approved drugs as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek approval in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies, and allow for approval to provide new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	We continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	We decide on a product-by-product basis whether to continue development into Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials and commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	For example, in December 2010, we decided that we would move NKTR-102 into Phase 3 development prior to completing a collaboration for this drug candidate.
906709_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas and methods of treatment.

906709_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	By applying our proprietary pro-drug polymer conjugate technology to irinotecan, NKTR-102 has the potential to be a more effective and tolerable anti-tumor agent.
906709_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	is a topoisomerase I inhibitor used for the treatment of solid tumors.
906709_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	Using a proprietary approach that directly conjugates the drug to a multi-arm polymer architecture to create a new molecular entity, NKTR-102 has a unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile that has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in patients in clinical trials conducted to date by us.
906709_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	The NKTR-102 Phase 2 study in metastatic breast cancer patients is an open label, randomized, study evaluating two treatment schedules of single-agent NKTR-102 (145 mg/m2 every 14 days or every 21 days).
906709_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	Patients enrolled in the study included those with metastatic breast cancer with prior taxane therapy.
906709_11_ITEM1_P64_S2	The study s primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.0 (standard criteria measuring tumor response) with certain secondary endpoints including safety, as well as progression-free survival and overall survival.
906709_11_ITEM1_P64_S3	The study was fully enrolled as of April 2010; however there are patients who continue to be monitored in the Phase 2 trial and therefore we do not expect to have final results until late 2011 or later depending upon patient outcomes.
906709_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	We have begun the planning of a comparative Phase 3 clinical study for single-agent NKTR-102 in metastatic breast cancer patients and plan to start this study in late 2011.
906709_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	Breast cancer is a significant health problem for women worldwide.
906709_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	The American Cancer Society estimated that about 207,090 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed and nearly 39,840 women died of breast cancer in the United States in 2010.
906709_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States, other than skin cancer.
906709_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	It is the second leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung cancer.
906709_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	Worldwide, about 1.3 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually.
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	The NKTR-102 Phase 2 study in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer is an open label, randomized, study evaluating two treatment schedules of single-agent NKTR-102 (145 mg/m2 every 14 days or every 21 days).
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	Each schedule originally followed a two-stage Simon design and a total of 71 patients were initially enrolled and dosed.
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S2	Median lines of prior therapy for women enrolled into the original study was three, with forty-seven percent of the women having received prior treatment with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD).
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S3	The primary endpoint of the study was ORR based on RECIST 1.0.
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S4	Secondary endpoints in the study included best clinical response, clinical benefit, CA-125 response (a known ovarian cancer blood marker) safety, progression-free survival and overall survival.
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S5	In 2010, we announced that we are expanding this Phase 2 study to include approximately 50 additional women who had previously received PLD therapy to continue to evaluate the every 21-day dose schedule of single-agent NKTR-102 in this subset of women.
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S6	On March 1, 2011, we announced that we intended to further expand this Phase 2 clinical study by approximately 60 patients.
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S7	This expansion study is designed to give us the potential to determine whether we would make an early submission of an NDA to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NKTR-102.
906709_11_ITEM1_P69_S8	The determination of whether to submit an NDA will depend on our analysis of results from the study overall including the expanded dataset in the subset of women who had received prior PLD therapy as well as FDA requirements at that time and any guidance received by us from the FDA.
906709_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	We are evaluating various randomized controlled clinical study designs to further develop NKTR-102 in patients with ovarian cancer.
906709_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, The results from the expanded Phase 2 clinical trial for NKTR-102 in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer are unlikely to result in a review or approval of an NDA, and the future results from this trial are difficult to predict.
906709_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Ovarian cancer is also a significant health problem for women worldwide.
906709_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	According to the American Cancer Society, in 2010, there were an estimated 21,880 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed and an estimated 13,850 deaths from ovarian cancer in the United States.
906709_11_ITEM1_P71_S2	Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
906709_11_ITEM1_P71_S3	Historically, less than 40% of women with ovarian cancer are cured.
906709_11_ITEM1_P71_S4	About 230,000 women globally are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer.
906709_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	A NKTR-102 Phase 2 clinical study was initiated in early 2009 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-102 monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene.
906709_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 placebo-controlled trial of NKTR-102 in colorectal cancer is progression-free survival as compared to standard irinotecan monotherapy.
906709_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	According to recent data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2010, it is estimated that up to 43.5% of colorectal cancer cases have this mutation in the KRAS gene and do not respond to EGFR-inhibitors, such as cetuximab.
906709_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Phase 2 clinical study is designed to enroll 174 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	The study is still enrolling and we do not currently have an estimate for the projected end of this trial.
906709_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	Patient enrollment in this study has been challenging due to the fact that the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the United States or European Union.
906709_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	In June 2010, we announced the start of a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study designed to enroll up to approximately 40 patients to evaluate NKTR-102 in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers.
906709_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen.
906709_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.
906709_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 142,750 new cases of colon and rectal cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2010, and about 50,000 people will die annually of the disease.
906709_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	Worldwide, over 1.2 million people are diagnosed annually with colorectal cancer.
906709_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Most metastatic colorectal cancer patients have recurrence within two years and require retreatment with chemotherapy regimens.
906709_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	patients receive irinotecan-based regimens, primarily in combination with 5-FU/leucovorin.
906709_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered separately, and the second leading cause when both sexes are combined.
906709_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	It was expected to cause about 51,370 deaths (26,580 in men and 24,790 in women) during 2010 in the U.S. Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, there are 690,000 deaths annually from colorectal cancers.
906709_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	NKTR-105 is a PEGylated conjugate form of docetaxel, an anti-neoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid family that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells.
906709_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	Docetaxel is a major chemotherapy agent approved for use in five different cancer indications: breast, non-small cell lung, prostate, gastric, and head and neck.
906709_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	Annual sales of docetaxel exceeded $2 billion in 2009.
906709_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Anti-cancer agents, such as docetaxel, typically have suboptimal pharmacokinetic profiles which can limit their therapeutic value.
906709_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	Patients are advised that the treatment with corticosteroids is required in conjunction with docetaxel dosing and some neutropenia patients require pre-treatment with corticosterioids.
906709_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	Our advanced polymer conjugation technology can be used to optimize the bioactivity of these drugs and increase the sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	NKTR-105 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in cancer patients.
906709_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	The study is assessing the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of NKTR-105 in patients with refractory solid tumors who have failed all prior available therapies.
906709_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	We do not intend to advance NKTR-105 into a Phase 2 clinical trial in 2011.
906709_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	NKTR-181 is being developed as a safer, mu opioid analgesic with reduced potential for abuse and fewer side effects than traditional opioid therapies.
906709_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	The drug candidate was engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier at a substantially slower rate than the reference opioid.
906709_11_ITEM1_P85_S2	With a reduced rate of entry into the CNS, NKTR-181 has the potential to substantially reduce not only the euphoria that underlies opioid abuse liability and dependence but also the serious CNS-related side effects of respiratory depression and sedation.
906709_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	We filed an Investigational New Drug application (IND) with the FDA and plan to begin Phase 1 clinical studies in the first part of 2011.
906709_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	The IND is currently under review by the FDA and until the 30-day review period has elapsed, there is the possibility that the start of the Phase 1 clinical study may be delayed until any and all issues raised by the FDA have been addressed in a satisfactory manner.
906709_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	According to the American Pain Society, the prevalence of chronic pain in the United States is estimated to be 35.5% of the population or 105 million people.
906709_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Chronic pain costs more than $100 billion per year in direct health-care expenditures and lost work time.
906709_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain and have over $10 billion a year in sales in the U.S. alone according to IMS Health.
906709_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	However, opioids cause significant problems for physicians and patients because of their serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation, as well as the risks they pose for addiction, abuse, misuse, and diversion.
906709_11_ITEM1_P88_S3	The FDA has cited prescription opioid analgesics as being at the center of a major public health crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death.
906709_11_ITEM1_P88_S4	A 2010 recent report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that emergency room visits tied to the abuse of prescription painkillers is at an all-time high, having increased 111% over a five-year period.
906709_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	We have a number of product candidates in clinical development and approved products in collaboration with our partners that use our technology or involve rights over which we have patents or other proprietary intellectual property.

906709_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	was approved in the EU and the product was subsequently launched by Roche in the EU in August of 2007.
906709_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	but the product has not been launched in the U.S. as a result of patent-related issues.
906709_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	in the U.S. even though the FDA approved MIRCERA .
906709_11_ITEM1_P116_S0	in the U.S. in July 2014.
906709_11_ITEM1_P117_S0	and, in 2006 and 2007, we entered into a series of interim letter agreements with Pfizer to develop a next generation form of dry powder inhaled insulin and proprietary inhaler device, also known as NGI.
906709_11_ITEM1_P118_S0	In January 2006, Exubera received marketing approval in the U.S. and EU for the treatment of adults with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
906709_11_ITEM1_P118_S1	Under the collaborative development and licensing agreement, Pfizer had sole responsibility for marketing and selling Exubera.
906709_11_ITEM1_P118_S2	We performed all of the manufacturing of the Exubera dry powder insulin, and we supplied Pfizer with the Exubera inhalers through third party contract manufacturers (Bespak Europe Ltd. and Tech Group North America, Inc.).
906709_11_ITEM1_P118_S3	We recorded no revenue from Pfizer related to these activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008.
906709_11_ITEM1_P119_S0	On October 18, 2007, Pfizer announced that it was exiting the Exubera business and gave notice of termination under our collaborative development and licensing agreement.
906709_11_ITEM1_P119_S1	On November 9, 2007, we entered into a termination agreement and mutual release with Pfizer.
906709_11_ITEM1_P119_S2	Under this agreement we received a one-time payment of $135.0 million in November 2007 from Pfizer in satisfaction of all outstanding contractual obligations under our then-existing agreements relating to Exubera and NGI.
906709_11_ITEM1_P119_S3	All agreements between Pfizer and us related to Exubera and NGI, other than the termination agreement and mutual release and a related interim Exubera manufacturing maintenance letter, terminated on November 9, 2007.
906709_11_ITEM1_P119_S4	In February 2008, we entered into a termination agreement with Bespak and Tech Group pursuant to which we paid an aggregate of $40.2 million in satisfaction of outstanding accounts payable and termination costs and expenses that were due under the Exubera inhaler contract manufacturing agreement.
906709_11_ITEM1_P119_S5	We also entered into a maintenance agreement with both Pfizer and Tech Group to preserve key personnel and manufacturing capacity to support potential future Exubera inhaler manufacturing if we found a new partner for the inhaled insulin program.
906709_11_ITEM1_P120_S0	On April 9, 2008, we announced that we had ceased all negotiations with potential partners for Exubera and NGI as a result of new data analysis from ongoing clinical trials conducted by Pfizer which indicated an increase in the number of new cases of lung cancer in Exubera patients who were former smokers as compared to patients in the control group who were not former smokers.
906709_11_ITEM1_P120_S1	In April 2008, we ceased all spending associated with maintaining Exubera manufacturing capacity and any further NGI development, including, but not limited to, terminating the Exubera manufacturing capacity maintenance arrangements with Pfizer and Tech Group.
906709_11_ITEM1_P121_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business, associated technology and intellectual property to Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (together referred to as Novartis) for a purchase price of $115.0 million in cash (Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale).
906709_11_ITEM1_P121_S1	Under the terms of the transaction, we transferred to Novartis certain assets and obligations related to our pulmonary technology, development and manufacturing operations including:
906709_11_ITEM1_P122_S0	approximately 140 of our personnel primarily dedicated to our pulmonary technology, development programs, and manufacturing operations.
906709_11_ITEM1_P123_S0	In addition, we retained all of our rights to BAY41-6551, partnered with Bayer Healthcare LLC, certain royalty rights for the Cipro Inhale development program partnered with Bayer Schering Pharma AG, and certain intellectual property rights specific to inhaled insulin.
906709_11_ITEM1_P124_S0	In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, we also entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with Novartis Pharma.
906709_11_ITEM1_P124_S1	Pursuant to the Exclusive License Agreement, Novartis Pharma granted back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, non-transferable, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights acquired by Novartis Pharma from Nektar in the transaction, as well as certain improvements or modifications thereto that are made by Novartis Pharma after the closing.
906709_11_ITEM1_P124_S2	Certain of such patent rights and other related intellectual property rights relate to our development program for inhaled vancomycin or are necessary for us to satisfy certain of our continuing contractual obligations to third parties, including in connection with development, manufacture, sale, and commercialization activities related to BAY41-6551.
906709_11_ITEM1_P124_S3	Novartis and we will provide each other with specified services for limited time periods following the closing of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale to facilitate the transition of the acquired assets and business from us to Novartis.
906709_11_ITEM1_P125_S0	The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries.
906709_11_ITEM1_P125_S1	These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
906709_11_ITEM1_P126_S0	The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms.
906709_11_ITEM1_P126_S1	If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
906709_11_ITEM1_P127_S0	submission to the FDA of an NDA for approval of a drug, a BLA for approval of a biological product or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or Premarket Notification 510(k) for a medical device product (a 510(k)).
906709_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA may not be necessary if the company has a right of reference to such data or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Services Act.
906709_11_ITEM1_P129_S0	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation.
906709_11_ITEM1_P129_S1	Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations.
906709_11_ITEM1_P129_S2	The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin.
906709_11_ITEM1_P129_S3	Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires clarification within that period.
906709_11_ITEM1_P130_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review.
906709_11_ITEM1_P130_S1	Drug products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).
906709_11_ITEM1_P130_S2	Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study.
906709_11_ITEM1_P130_S3	Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
906709_11_ITEM1_P131_S0	Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study.
906709_11_ITEM1_P131_S1	The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted.
906709_11_ITEM1_P131_S2	The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical study.
906709_11_ITEM1_P132_S0	Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases.
906709_11_ITEM1_P133_S0	Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion.
906709_11_ITEM1_P133_S1	Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
906709_11_ITEM1_P134_S0	identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
906709_11_ITEM1_P135_S0	If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability.
906709_11_ITEM1_P136_S0	The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk.
906709_11_ITEM1_P136_S1	In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S0	Following a series of formal and informal meetings between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S1	The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S2	Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S3	Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S4	Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S5	Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S6	The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs.
906709_11_ITEM1_P137_S7	After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
906709_11_ITEM1_P138_S0	Each manufacturing establishment producing drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment.
906709_11_ITEM1_P138_S1	Establishments handling controlled substances must also be licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
906709_11_ITEM1_P138_S2	Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements.
906709_11_ITEM1_P138_S3	They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
906709_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	A number of the drugs we are developing are already approved for marketing by the FDA in another form or using another delivery system.
906709_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	We believe that, when working with drugs approved in other forms, the approval process for products using our alternative drug delivery or formulation technologies may involve less risk and require fewer tests than new chemical entities do.
906709_11_ITEM1_P139_S2	However, we expect that our formulations will often use excipients not currently approved for use.
906709_11_ITEM1_P139_S3	Use of these excipients will require additional toxicological testing that may increase the costs of, or length of time needed to, gain regulatory approval.
906709_11_ITEM1_P139_S4	In addition, as they relate to our products, regulatory procedures may change as regulators gain relevant experience, and any such changes may delay or increase the cost of regulatory approvals.
906709_11_ITEM1_P140_S0	For product candidates currently under development utilizing pulmonary technology, the pulmonary inhaler devices are considered to be part of a drug and device combination for deep lung delivery of each specific molecule.
906709_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	The FDA will make a determination as to the most appropriate center and division within the agency that will assume primary responsibility for the review of the applicable applications, which would consist of an IND and an NDA or BLA where CDER or CBER are determined to have primary jurisdiction or an investigational device exemption application and PMA or 510(k) where the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is determined to have primary jurisdiction.
906709_11_ITEM1_P141_S1	In the case of our product candidates, CDER in consultation with CDRH could be involved in the review.
906709_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	The assessment of jurisdiction within the FDA is based upon the primary mode of action of the drug or the location of the specific expertise in one of the centers.
906709_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	Where CDRH is determined to have primary jurisdiction over a product, 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is required.
906709_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	Medical devices are classified into one of three classes Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
906709_11_ITEM1_P144_S1	Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a Premarket Notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device.
906709_11_ITEM1_P144_S2	This process is known as 510(k) clearance.
906709_11_ITEM1_P144_S3	Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement.
906709_11_ITEM1_P144_S4	Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring PMA approval.
906709_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	To date, our partners have generally been responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, but we may participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for the inhaler device or drug.
906709_11_ITEM1_P145_S1	For our proprietary products, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for product candidates being developed under an IND.
906709_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
906709_11_ITEM1_P146_S1	Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.
906709_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs.
906709_11_ITEM1_P147_S1	Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
906709_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.
906709_11_ITEM1_P148_S1	The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years.
906709_11_ITEM1_P148_S2	In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products.
906709_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	shown to be clinically superior to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
906709_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the E.U.
906709_11_ITEM1_P151_S0	In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track designation to a product candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.
906709_11_ITEM1_P151_S1	An important feature of Fast Track designation is that it emphasizes the critical nature of close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development.
906709_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	We invest a significant portion of our resources in the creation and development of new drug compounds that serve unmet needs in the treatment of patients.
906709_11_ITEM1_P152_S1	In doing so, we create intellectual property.
906709_11_ITEM1_P152_S2	As part of our strategy to secure our intellectual property created by these efforts, we routinely apply for patents, rely on trade secret protection, and enter into contractual obligations with third parties.
906709_11_ITEM1_P152_S3	When appropriate, we will defend our intellectual property, taking any and all legal remedies available to us, including, for example, asserting patent infringement, trade secret misappropriation and breach of contract claims.
906709_11_ITEM1_P152_S4	As of January 1, 2011, we owned greater than 100 U.S. and 380 foreign patents.
906709_11_ITEM1_P152_S5	Currently, we have over approximately 100 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 480 pending in other countries.
906709_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	A focus area of our current drug creation and development efforts centers on our innovations in and improvements to our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms.
906709_11_ITEM1_P153_S1	In this area, our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, some of which we acquired in our acquisition of Shearwater Corporation in June 2001.
906709_11_ITEM1_P153_S2	More specifically, our patents and patent applications cover polymer architecture, drug conjugates, formulations, methods of making polymers and polymer conjugates, and methods of administering polymer conjugates.
906709_11_ITEM1_P153_S3	Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world.
906709_11_ITEM1_P153_S4	Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid).
906709_11_ITEM1_P153_S5	In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent.
906709_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	In January 2002, we entered into a Cross-License and Option Agreement with Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., pursuant to which we and Enzon provided certain licenses to selected portions of each party s PEGylation patent portfolio.
906709_11_ITEM1_P154_S1	In certain cases, we have the option to license certain of Enzon s PEGylation patents for use in our proprietary products or for sublicenses to third parties in each case in exchange for payments to Enzon based on manufacturing profits, revenue share or royalties on net sales if a designated product candidate is approved in one or more markets.
906709_11_ITEM1_P155_S0	In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as of December 31, 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novartis Pharma.
906709_11_ITEM1_P155_S1	Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Novartis Pharma grants back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights acquired by Novartis from us in the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as well as certain improvements or modifications thereto that are made by Novartis.
906709_11_ITEM1_P155_S2	Certain of such patent rights and other related intellectual property rights relate to our development program for inhaled vancomycin or are necessary for us to satisfy certain continuing contractual obligations to third parties, including in connection with development, manufacture, sale, and commercialization activities related to BAY41-6551 partnered with Bayer Healthcare LLC.
906709_11_ITEM1_P156_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_11_ITEM1_P156_S1	There can be no assurance that the patents we apply for will be issued to us or that the patents that are issued to us will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_11_ITEM1_P156_S2	Even for patents that are enforceable, we anticipate that any attempt to enforce our patents would be time consuming and costly.
906709_11_ITEM1_P156_S3	Additionally, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.
906709_11_ITEM1_P157_S0	eventually issue, or those that have issued, will be circumvented.
906709_11_ITEM1_P158_S0	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions.
906709_11_ITEM1_P158_S1	Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable.
906709_11_ITEM1_P158_S2	An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.
906709_11_ITEM1_P158_S3	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our technology on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, and If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_11_ITEM1_P159_S0	U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights exist that are owned by third parties and relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, medical devices and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions.
906709_11_ITEM1_P159_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, of these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_11_ITEM1_P159_S2	We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims.
906709_11_ITEM1_P159_S3	Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages.
906709_11_ITEM1_P160_S0	In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties.
906709_11_ITEM1_P160_S1	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology.
906709_11_ITEM1_P160_S2	The failure to obtain licenses if needed may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_11_ITEM1_P161_S0	We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_11_ITEM1_P161_S1	No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_11_ITEM1_P161_S2	Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets.
906709_11_ITEM1_P161_S3	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_11_ITEM1_P162_S0	In certain situations in which we work with drugs covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs.
906709_11_ITEM1_P162_S1	Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages.
906709_11_ITEM1_P162_S2	Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_11_ITEM1_P163_S0	It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
906709_11_ITEM1_P163_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
906709_11_ITEM1_P163_S2	The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property.
906709_11_ITEM1_P163_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
906709_11_ITEM1_P164_S0	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements with partners, under which we may receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties or manufacturing revenue.

906709_11_ITEM1_P171_S1	The only approved treatment for OIC is a subcutaneous treatment known as methylnaltrexone bromide marketed by Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.
906709_11_ITEM1_P171_S2	Other current therapies that are utilized to treat OIC and OBD include over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, such as docusate sodium, senna, and milk of magnesia.
906709_11_ITEM1_P171_S3	These therapies do not address the underlying cause of constipation as a result of opioid use and are generally viewed as ineffective or only partially effective to treat the symptoms of OID and OBD.
906709_11_ITEM1_P172_S0	There are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations.
906709_11_ITEM1_P173_S0	Potential competitors include Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Adolor Corporation, GlaxoSmithKline, Mundipharma Int.

906709_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	General and administrative expenses are associated with administrative staffing, business development, finance, marketing, and legal.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 remained at a consistent level compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	In 2011, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase modestly compared to 2010.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to decreased employee compensation costs of $4.1 million, decreased professional fees of $4.3 million, and decreased marketing costs of $1.5 million due to our election to terminate our co-promotion rights and obligations under the collaboration agreement with Bayer for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we relocated all of our operations previously located in San Carlos, California, including our corporate headquarters, to our Mission Bay Facility in San Francisco, California.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This event triggered an impairment test to be performed for the remaining assets located in San Carlos and an impairment charge of $12.6 million was recognized as a result.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	We determined the carrying value of the San Carlos facility exceeded its fair value based on a discounted cash flow model.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2008, impairment of long lived assets included an impairment charge of $1.5 million related to a specialized dryer designed for our PEGylation manufacturing facility.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The dryer was not functioning properly and was not being used in operations.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	We determined the carrying value of the manufacturing equipment exceeded the fair value based on a discounted cash flow model.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	On December 31, 2008, we sold certain of our pulmonary assets to Novartis for $115.0 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The gain on sale of pulmonary assets includes the purchase price received from Novartis less the net book value of property and equipment of $37.3 million, an equity investment in Pearl Therapeutics, Inc. of $2.7 million, transaction costs of $4.6 million, and other costs of $0.9 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The decreases in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 compared to the previous years were primarily attributable to lower interest rates earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to the complete amortization of deferred financing costs during 2010 from our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes due September 2012 and decreased interest expense from capital leases.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We expect the interest expense in 2011 to remain at a level consistent with 2010.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We repurchased $100.0 million par value of our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of 2008.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This resulted in a lower average balance of notes outstanding and a corresponding decrease in interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	During the three months ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased approximately $100.0 million in par value of our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes for an aggregate purchase price of $47.8 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The recognized gain on debt extinguishment is net of transaction costs of $1.0 million and accelerated amortization of our deferred financing costs of $1.1 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and research and development contracts, as well as public and private placements of debt and equity.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	As of December 31, 2010, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of $315.9 million and indebtedness of $240.4 million, including $215.0 million of convertible subordinated notes, $19.0 million in capital lease obligations and $6.4 million in other liabilities.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Additionally at December 31, 2010, we had letter of credit arrangements with certain financial institutions and vendors, including our landlord, totaling $2.4 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P11_S3	These letters of credit will expire during 2011 and are secured by investments of similar amounts.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P11_S4	On January 24, 2011, we completed a public offering of our common stock with proceeds of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Additionally, as part of the public offering, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We will likely not have sufficient capital to fund the development of the drug candidates in our current research and development pipeline, fund late stage clinical development of NKTR-102 and repay the $215.0 million convertible notes when they become due in September 2012.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	resources because we anticipate bearing a majority or all of the development costs for that drug candidate.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Prior to the maturity of the convertible notes, we plan to explore a number of alternatives to provide for the repayment of the convertible notes, including restructuring the convertible notes.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Despite these efforts, we may be unable to find a commercially acceptable alternative or any alternative to repaying the notes by September 2012.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, We will need to restructure our convertible notes or raise substantial additional capital to repay the notes and fund operations, and we may be unable to restructure the notes or raise such capital when needed and on acceptable terms.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2011, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our short-term investments.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	These investments are generally held to maturity, which is less than one year.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	However, if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we held $298.2 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of 145 days.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we do not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P15_S5	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in operating activities totaled $55.9 million, which primarily consisted of spending on operating costs and expenses and includes $7.0 million for interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes, and was partially offset by a $50.0 million upfront payment received from Amgen under the supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement that we entered into with Amgen in October 2010.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront payments received, if any, will increase in 2011 as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $39.7 million, which included the $125.0 million upfront payment received from AstraZeneca under the license agreement we entered into for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 and a $31.0 million license extension payment received from Roche in December 2009.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2008, net cash used for our operating activities was $145.8 million, which included a number of significant items including a $10.0 million clinical development milestone received from Bayer Healthcare LLC under our collaboration agreement for Amikacin Inhale, payments by us to Bespak Europe Ltd. and Tech Group North America, Inc. of $40.2 million for amounts due under termination agreements with these Exubera inhaler device contract manufacturers, all of which was recorded as an expense in 2007, $6.8 million paid to maintain Exubera manufacturing capacity through April 2008, and $5.4 million for severance, and employee benefits in connection with our workforce reduction plans.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We purchased $31.5 million, $16.4 million, and $18.9 million of property and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Additionally, we made advanced payments on property and equipment purchases of $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our capital expenditures increased in 2010, as we constructed the leasehold improvements for the Mission Bay Facility and completed our research and development facility in Hyderabad, India.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	We expect our capital expenditures to decrease in 2011 compared to 2010.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain pulmonary assets to Novartis for a purchase price of $115.0 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We paid $0.2 million in transaction costs related to the sale during the year ended December 31, 2008 and $4.4 million in transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2009.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In addition, in July 2008, we invested $4.2 million in Pearl Therapeutics Inc. (Pearl).
906709_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In 2007, we granted Pearl a limited field intellectual property license to certain of our proprietary pulmonary delivery technology.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Pulmonary Asset Sale, we transferred our ownership interest in Pearl to Novartis and assigned the Pearl intellectual property license to Novartis.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $8.9 million, $4.8 million, and $0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased approximately $100.0 million in par value of our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes for an aggregate purchase price of $47.8 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The $215.0 million of 3.25% convertible subordinated notes outstanding at December 31, 2010, are due in September 2012.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	On January 24, 2011, we completed a public offering of our common stock with proceeds of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 7 of Item 8.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	These amounts primarily result from our office space lease at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California under capital lease arrangements.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As of November 29, 2010, we have ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of all of our functions, including our corporate headquarters and an R D center, to our Mission Bay Facility.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We currently intend to sublease the San Carlos space, but have not been relieved of any obligations of the terms of this lease, which is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In November 2010, we moved into our Mission Bay Facility, which includes our corporate headquarters and an R D center at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South in San Francisco, California.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Under the terms of the sublease we entered into with Pfizer Inc. on September 30, 2009 for the Mission Bay Facility, we will begin making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The sublease is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2010 that were issued under existing contracts.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	This amount does not represent minimum contract termination liability for our existing contracts.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Given our current cash requirements, we forecast that we will have sufficient cash to meet our net operating expense requirements and contractual obligations at least through December 31, 2011.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We plan to continue to invest in our growth and our future cash requirements will depend upon the timing and results of these investments.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims, the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	To date we have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes that are convertible into our common stock.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our substantial debt, the market price of our securities, and the general economic climate, among other factors, could have material consequences for our financial condition and could affect our sources of short-term and long-term funding.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Our ability to meet our ongoing operating expenses and repay our outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon our and our partners ability to successfully complete clinical development of, obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize new drugs.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Even if we or our partners are successful, we may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations as they become due.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P31_S4	There can be no assurance that additional funds, if and when required, will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P34_S2	We have determined that for the periods reported in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of our operations.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	License, collaboration and other research revenue is recognized based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes amortization of upfront fees.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	We defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Upfront fees are recognized ratably over the expected performance period under each arrangement.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, clinical development activities, or manufacturing activities through the commercial life of the product.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Given the complexities and uncertainties of research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by management to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had $46.5 million of deferred upfront fees related to five research and collaboration agreements that are being amortized over 6 to 24 years, or an average of 12 years.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	For our research and collaboration agreements, our performance obligations may span the life of the agreement.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P39_S1	For these, the shortest reasonable period is the end of the development period (estimated to be 4 to 6 years) and the longest period is the contractual life of the agreement, which is generally 10-12 years from the first commercial sale.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Given the statistical probability of drug development success in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, drug development programs have only a 5% to 10% probability of reaching commercial success.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If we had determined a longer or shorter amortization period was appropriate, our annual upfront fee amortization for these agreements could be as low as $4.0 million or as high as $17.0 million.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we also had $95.2 million of deferred upfront fees related to five license and supply agreements that are being amortized over periods from 2 and 10 years.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	either specified or is much shorter than research and collaboration agreements.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We may experience delays in the execution of technology transfer plans, which may result in a longer amortization period for applicable agreements.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our original estimates are periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimates to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model adjusted for the estimated historical forfeiture rate for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of our stock-based compensation arrangements on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and expense this value ratably over the service period of the option or performance period of the Restricted Stock Unit award (RSU).
906709_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition, management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical trial activities performed by third parties.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical trials ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If the actual timing of these phases varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual prospectively.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We accrue costs associated with treatment phase of clinical trials based on the total estimated cost of the clinical trials and are expensed ratably based on patient enrollment in the trials.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) published Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, which amends the criteria to identify separate units of accounting within Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements .
906709_11_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The revised guidance also expands the disclosure required for multiple-element revenue arrangements.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	FASB ASU No. 2009-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We do not expect this ASU will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations when we adopt it on January 1, 2011.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	However, the adoption of this guidance may result in revenue recognition patterns for agreements entered into or modified after adoption that are materially different from those recognized under the existing multiple-element guidance.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	No. 08-09, Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P51_S1	FASB ASU No. 2010-17 provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P51_S2	FASB ASU No. 2010 17 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved after the adoption date.
906709_11_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We do not expect this ASU will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations when we adopt it on January 1, 2011.
906709_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease a 102,283 square foot facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility), under an operating lease which expires in 2020.
906709_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	In November 2010, we moved into the Mission Bay Facility relocating all of our functions from the San Carlos, California facility (San Carlos Facility), including our corporate headquarters and research and development for our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology operations.

906709_11_ITEM2_P3_S1	In addition, we lease approximately 3,000 square feet of facilities in or near Hyderabad, India under various operating leases, with expiration dates in 2011.
906709_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
906709_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

906709_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to improve the benefits of drugs for patients.
906709_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our current proprietary product pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas, including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, anti-viral and immunology.
906709_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other potential biologic drug candidates.
906709_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	We create our innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of drugs to create new molecular entities.
906709_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of the molecule when it is bonded with polymers.
906709_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life, bioavailability, metabolism or distribution of drugs and improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for the patient.
906709_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drugs in multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	During 2010, we continued to make substantial investments to advance our pipeline of drug candidates from early stage discovery research through clinical development.
906709_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	In 2010, we continued to advance Phase 2 clinical trials for NKTR-102 (topoisomerase I inhibitor-polymer conjugate) in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Phase 2 clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer patients was fully enrolled in 2010 with patients continuing in the study into 2011.
906709_11_ITEM7_P4_S2	In 2010, we expanded the Phase 2 clinical trial by 50 patients in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients and on March 1, 2011, we announced that we intended to further expand this study by up to 60 additional patients.
906709_11_ITEM7_P4_S3	We expect this expansion trial to continue to enroll in 2011.
906709_11_ITEM7_P4_S4	The Phase 2 clinical study in metastatic colorectal cancer patients is still enrolling.
906709_11_ITEM7_P4_S5	Enrollment in the colorectal cancer study has been challenging due to the fact that the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the United States or Europe.
906709_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	In December 2010, we announced that we were planning to take NKTR-102 into Phase 3 clinical development prior to seeking a collaboration partner.
906709_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	We are currently planning a comparative Phase 3 clinical study for NKTR-102 in metastatic breast cancer and plan to start this study in late 2011.
906709_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	In addition, we will also continue the expanded Phase 2 clinical trial in platinum resistant/refractory patients to evaluate the potential of an early submission of a New Drug Application to the United States Food and Drug Administration depending on our assessment of those expanded study results.
906709_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	The size, scope and timing of our investment in a comparative Phase 3 clinical study in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer will depend upon a number of important variables including our evaluation of the expanded Phase 2 study results, discussions with health authorities and key opinion leaders, evolving regulatory standards and requirements, and the estimated cost of these studies.
906709_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	We anticipate our Phase 3 development plans for NKTR-102 to require substantial investment over the next several years.
906709_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Our focus on research and clinical development requires substantial investments that continue to increase as we advance each drug candidate through each phase of the development cycle.
906709_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	In addition to advancing our proprietary programs that are currently in clinical development, we are committed to continuing to make significant investments to advance new opportunities from our earlier stage research discovery pipeline.
906709_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	For example, we plan to start a Phase 1 clinical study for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2011.
906709_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results is extremely difficult to predict.
906709_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial prospects, financial condition, and market value.
906709_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	We have a number of existing license and collaboration agreements with third parties in which we have an economic interest and could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	In particular, the future clinical and commercial success or failure of our collaboration with AstraZeneca for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 and our collaboration with Bayer for Amikacin Inhale will have a material impact on our business and financial condition over the next several years.
906709_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	among other of our collaboration agreements, will together have a material impact on our business, financial results and cash position.
906709_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	Because drug development and commercialization is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, there is a substantial risk that our future revenue from one or more of these agreements will be less than we project in our business plans.
906709_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary PEGylation reagents on a cost-plus or fixed price basis.
906709_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply PEGylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or for third party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	As a result, whenever possible, we are renegotiating or not seeking renewal of legacy manufacturing supply arrangements that do not include a strategic development or commercialization component.
906709_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	For example, in October 2010 we entered into a supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement with Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited, which has significantly amended economic and other terms in the non-exclusive supply and license agreement we previously entered into with Amgen in July 1995.
906709_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	In addition, in December 2010 we entered into an amended manufacturing and supply agreement with Merck (through its subsidiary Schering) to provide for transfer to an alternative manufacturer and revised economics for an interim supply arrangement until that transition is completed.
906709_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $315.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments and $240.4 million in indebtedness.
906709_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	On January 24, 2011, we completed a public offering of our common stock with proceeds of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Additionally, as part of the public offering, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	We have $215.0 million in outstanding convertible subordinated notes due September 2012.
906709_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	We do not have sufficient resources to fund our research and development plans and repay these convertible notes.
906709_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital.
906709_11_ITEM7_P11_S6	We expect the Phase 3 clinical studies of NKTR-102 to require particularly significant resources because we anticipate bearing a majority or all of the development costs for that drug candidate.
906709_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Prior to the maturity of the convertible notes, we plan to explore a number of alternatives to provide for the repayment of the notes, including restructuring the notes.
906709_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales and royalties, development and commercialization collaboration contracts and debt and equity financings.
906709_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	While in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration agreements and other significant transactions, we do not currently anticipate receiving substantial payments for new transactions in the near future.
906709_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	To date we have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes that are convertible into our common stock.
906709_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	Our substantial debt, the market price of our securities, and the general economic climate, among other factors, could have material consequences for our financial condition and could affect our sources of short-term and long-term funding.
906709_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	Our ability to meet our ongoing operating expenses and repay our outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon our and our partners ability to successfully complete clinical development of, obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize new drugs.
906709_11_ITEM7_P13_S5	Even if we or our partners are successful, we may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations as they become due.
906709_11_ITEM7_P13_S6	There can be no assurance that additional funds, if and when required, will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
906709_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Total revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily due to the recognition of the remaining $101.4 million of the $125.0 million upfront payment received from AstraZeneca AB for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 in the fourth quarter of 2009.
906709_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2010, recognition of amounts received from AstraZeneca AB represented 68% of our total revenue.
906709_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Total revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily as a result of the sale of certain of our pulmonary assets to Novartis completed on December 31, 2008 (Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale) and lower product manufacturing volumes required by our collaboration partners.
906709_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, our collaboration agreement with Novartis for TIP was terminated and our collaboration agreement with Bayer Schering Pharma AG for Cipro Inhale was assigned to Novartis.
906709_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2009, two of our partners, AstraZeneca AB and UCB Pharma, represented 35% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenue.
906709_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Product sales include cost-plus and fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	We also receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales once their products are approved for commercial sale.
906709_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	Royalty revenues were $7.3 million, $5.2 million, and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	The decrease in product sales and royalties for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is attributable to decreased product sales of $2.7 million partially offset by increased royalty revenue of $2.1 million.
906709_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	The timing of shipments is based on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	We expect product sales and royalties to decrease in 2011 due to decreased product sales partially offset by increased royalty revenues.
906709_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Lower product demand from our collaboration partners resulted in decreased product sales of approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
906709_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase in royalties of approximately $1.6 million partially offset the decrease in product sales compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
906709_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	License, collaboration and other revenue includes amortization of upfront payments and performance milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses.
906709_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The level of license, collaboration and other revenues depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront and milestone payments, the achievement of future milestones, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of reimbursed research and development work, and the signing of new collaborations.
906709_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in license, collaboration and other revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to recognition of the upfront payment received from AstraZeneca for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 in the fourth quarter of 2009, contract research and other revenue from AstraZeneca, and the recognition of the license extension option payment received from Roche in December 2009.
906709_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Under the AstraZeneca license agreement and related technology transfer agreement, we recognized $101.4 million and $23.6 million of the $125.0 million upfront payment and $6.5 million and $1.5 million of contract research and other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	We recognized $5.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of the $31.0 million license extension option payment from Roche for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The decrease in license, collaboration and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to elimination of any revenue from Novartis related to TIP and from Bayer Schering Pharma AG for Cipro Inhale as a result of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale.
906709_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	In addition, 2008 included revenue related to a new intellectual property license agreement we entered into with Roche and higher revenue from Bayer under our collaboration agreement for BAY41-6551.
906709_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	This decrease is partially off-set by $25.1 million in revenue recognized related to our agreement with AstraZeneca for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	We expect license, collaboration and other revenue to substantially decrease in 2011 due to the complete recognition as of December 31, 2010 of the upfront payment we received under the AstraZeneca license agreement.
906709_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $0.6 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $0.8 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2009.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2011, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our short-term investments.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are generally held to maturity, which is less than one year.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As of December 31, 2010, we held $298.2 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of 145 days.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S4	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S5	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S6	We have the ability and intent to hold our debt securities to maturity when they will be redeemed at full par value.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P2_S7	Accordingly, we consider unrealized losses to be temporary and have not recorded a provision for impairment.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.
906709_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2).
906709_11_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
906709_11_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
906709_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
906709_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
906709_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nektar Therapeutics at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
906709_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have audited Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
906709_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	Nektar Therapeutics management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
906709_11_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
906709_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
906709_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
906709_11_ITEM8_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	In our opinion, Nektar Therapeutics maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.
906709_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Nektar Therapeutics and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Francisco, California and incorporated in Delaware.
906709_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	We are developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms designed to improve the therapeutic benefits of drugs.
906709_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Nektar Therapeutics AL, Corporation (Nektar AL), Nektar Therapeutics (India) Private Limited, Nektar Therapeutics UK, Ltd. (Nektar UK) and Aerogen, Inc.
906709_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
906709_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	The merger of Nektar AL, an Alabama corporation, with and into its parent corporation, Nektar Therapeutics, was made effective July 31, 2009.
906709_11_ITEM8_P17_S1	As of the effective date, the separate existence of the Alabama corporation ceased, and all rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Alabama corporation are vested in Nektar Therapeutics, the surviving corporation.
906709_11_ITEM8_P17_S2	On December 2, 2010, we completed the dissolution of Aerogen, Inc. and all remaining assets were transferred to Nektar Therapeutics.
906709_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
906709_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
906709_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet.
906709_11_ITEM8_P18_S3	To date, such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position.
906709_11_ITEM8_P18_S4	Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recorded in operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were not material.
906709_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
906709_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to deferred revenue recognition periods, inventories, the impairment of investments and long-lived assets, restructuring and contingencies, stock-based compensation, and litigation, amongst others.
906709_11_ITEM8_P19_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
906709_11_ITEM8_P19_S4	These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily apparent from other sources.
906709_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	We consider all investments in marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
906709_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	Investments are designated as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
906709_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	The disclosed fair value related to our investments is based primarily on the reported fair values in our period-end brokerage statements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P20_S3	We independently validate these fair values using available market quotes and other information.
906709_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	Investments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date, if any, are classified as long-term.
906709_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale, as well as amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, are included in interest income.
906709_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are included in other income (expense).
906709_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
906709_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, and investments approximates fair value and is based on quoted market prices.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Our customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are located in the U.S. and Europe.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	Our accounts receivable balance contains billed and unbilled trade receivables from product sales and royalties and collaborative research and development agreements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	We provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S4	We perform a regular review of our customers payment histories and associated credit risk.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S5	We have not experienced significant credit losses from our accounts receivable.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S6	At December 31, 2010, two different customers represented 66% and 21%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_11_ITEM8_P25_S7	At December 31, 2009, four different customers represented 30%, 29%, 13%, and 13%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Inventory is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and stated net of reserves at the lower of cost or market.

906709_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	Supplies inventory related to research and development activities are expensed when purchased.
906709_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide raw materials, drugs and devices of appropriate quality and reliability and to meet applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	In certain cases, we rely on single sources of supply.
906709_11_ITEM8_P27_S2	Consequently, in the event that supplies are delayed or interrupted for any reason, our ability to develop and produce our products could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.
906709_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Property and equipment are stated at cost.

906709_11_ITEM8_P28_S3	Leasehold improvements and buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
906709_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	We periodically review our property and equipment for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
906709_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	Generally, an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset (See Note 12).
906709_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for another entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
906709_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	We test for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year using an October 1 measurement date, as well as at other times when impairment indicators exist or when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
906709_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	We are organized in one reporting unit and have evaluated the goodwill for the Company as a whole.
906709_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach.
906709_11_ITEM8_P33_S1	The first step is to compare the fair value of our net assets, including assigned goodwill, to the book value of our net assets, including assigned goodwill.
906709_11_ITEM8_P33_S2	If the fair value is greater than our net book value, the assigned goodwill is not considered impaired.
906709_11_ITEM8_P33_S3	If the fair value is less than our net book value, we perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any.
906709_11_ITEM8_P33_S4	The second step would be to compare the book value of our assigned goodwill to the implied fair value of our goodwill.
906709_11_ITEM8_P33_S5	We did not recognize any goodwill-related impairment charges during 2010, 2009, or 2008.
906709_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Product sales are primarily derived from cost-plus and fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the related agreement.

906709_11_ITEM8_P36_S1	Our arrangements may contain one or more of the following elements: upfront fees, contract research and development, milestone payments, manufacturing and supply, royalties, and license fees.
906709_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Each deliverable in the arrangement is evaluated to determine whether it meets the criteria to be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting or whether it should be combined with other deliverables.
906709_11_ITEM8_P37_S1	Revenue is recognized for each element when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Upfront fees received for license and collaborative agreements are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, clinical development activities, and manufacturing activities from development through the commercialization of the product.

906709_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	Final milestone payments are recorded and recognized upon achieving the respective milestone, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The original estimated amortization periods for upfront fees and milestone payments are periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimate to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	We record costs related to shipping and handling of product to customers in cost of goods sold.
906709_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock option grants and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under our equity incentive plans and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), in which employees may purchase our common stock at a discount to the market price.
906709_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model, adjusted for the estimated historical forfeiture rate, for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of the option or RSU award on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and the estimated fair value of common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination.
906709_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	We expense the value of the portion of the option or award that is ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
906709_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	Stock-based compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP are recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount.
906709_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	Expense amounts are allocated among inventory, cost of goods sold, research and development expenses, and general and administrative expenses based on the function of the applicable employee.

906709_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	For all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the net loss available to common stockholders is equal to the reported net loss.
906709_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same due to our historical net losses and the requirement to exclude potentially dilutive securities which would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.
906709_11_ITEM8_P50_S3	The weighted average of these potentially dilutive securities has been excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation and is as follows (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	We account for income taxes under the liability method; under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
906709_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
906709_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	We utilize a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions.
906709_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
906709_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.

906709_11_ITEM8_P96_S2	There is no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_11_ITEM8_P96_S3	We have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification obligations.
906709_11_ITEM8_P96_S4	If any of our indemnification obligations are triggered, however, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	Because the obligated amount of this agreement is not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	Historically, we have not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 or 2009.
906709_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, we indemnify our directors, executive officers, other officers, employees, and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity.
906709_11_ITEM8_P98_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, we have insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
906709_11_ITEM8_P98_S2	Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $500,000 per incident for securities related claims and $250,000 per incident for non-securities related claims retention deductible per our insurance policy.
906709_11_ITEM8_P98_S3	However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.
906709_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	Because the obligated amount of this agreement is not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	Historically, we have not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 or 2009.
906709_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	We have authorized 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with each share having a par value of $0.0001.
906709_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	Of these shares, 3,100,000 shares are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock).
906709_11_ITEM8_P100_S2	We have no preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2010 or 2009.
906709_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	On June 1, 2001, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of a Share Purchase Rights Plan.
906709_11_ITEM8_P101_S1	Terms of the Rights Plan provide for a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our Common Stock.
906709_11_ITEM8_P101_S2	The Rights have certain anti-takeover effects and will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our Board of Directors.
906709_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	The dividend distribution was payable on June 22, 2001 to the stockholders of record on that date.
906709_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $225.00 per one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment.
906709_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	Each one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock has designations and powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions which make its value approximately equal to the value of one share of common stock.
906709_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designation for the Series A Preferred Stock).
906709_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	The Rights will expire on June 1, 2011 unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by us.
906709_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	In the event of liquidation, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock would be entitled to $100 per share or, if greater than $100, an aggregate payment equal to 100 times the payment made per share of Common Stock.
906709_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will have 100 votes, voting together with the Common Stock.
906709_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which our Common Stock is exchanged, each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount of consideration received per share of Common Stock.
906709_11_ITEM8_P106_S2	The Series A Preferred Stock would rank junior to any other future series of preferred stock.
906709_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a stockholder, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.
906709_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	At December 31, 2010, we have reserved shares of common stock for issuance as follows (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	The following table summarizes information with respect to shares of our common stock that may be issued under our existing equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2010 (share number in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	Does not include options to purchase 25,546 shares of our common stock we assumed in connection with the acquisition of Shearwater Corporation (with a weighted-average exercise price of $0.03 per share).

906709_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	Our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (2008 Plan) was adopted by the Board of Directors on March 20, 2008 and was approved by our stockholders on June 6, 2008.
906709_11_ITEM8_P112_S1	The purpose of the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan is to attract and retain qualified personnel, to provide additional incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and employee directors and to promote the success of our business.
906709_11_ITEM8_P112_S2	Pursuant to the 2008 Plan, we may grant or issue incentive stock options to employees and officers and non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock bonuses to consultants, employees, officers and non-employee directors.
906709_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2008 Plan is 9,000,000 shares.
906709_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	granted under the 2008 Plan will be counted against the plan s share limit as 1.5 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award.
906709_11_ITEM8_P114_S1	The 2008 Plan will terminate on March 20, 2018, unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors.
906709_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	The maximum term of a stock option under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan is eight years, but if the optionee at the time of grant has voting power of more than 10% of our outstanding capital stock, the maximum term of an incentive stock option is five years.
906709_11_ITEM8_P115_S1	The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2008 Plan must be at least equal to 100% (or 110% with respect to holders of more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option as determined by the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.
906709_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	To the extent that shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock option, the number of underlying shares as to which the exercise related shall be counted against the applicable share limits of the 2008 Plan, as opposed to only counting the shares actually issued.
906709_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	Shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the 2008 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2008 Plan.
906709_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	On April 19, 2000, our Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) by amending and restating our 1994 Equity Incentive Plan.
906709_11_ITEM8_P117_S1	On February 9, 2010, the 2000 Plan expired.
906709_11_ITEM8_P117_S2	As a result, no new options may be granted, but existing options granted remain outstanding.
906709_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	The purpose of the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan was to attract and retain qualified personnel, to provide additional incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and employee directors and to promote the success of our business.
906709_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	Pursuant to the 2000 Plan, we granted or issued incentive stock options to employees and officers and non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock bonuses to consultants, employees, officers and non-employee directors.
906709_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	The maximum term of a stock option under the 2000 Plan is eight years, but if the optionee at the time of grant has voting power of more than 10% of our outstanding capital stock, the maximum term of an incentive stock option is five years.
906709_11_ITEM8_P119_S1	The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan must be at least equal to 100% (or 110% with respect to holders of more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option as determined by the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.
906709_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	The 1998 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors on August 18, 1998, and was amended and restated in its entirety and renamed the 2000 Non-officer Equity Incentive Plan on June 6, 2000 (2000 Non-Officer Plan).
906709_11_ITEM8_P120_S1	The purpose of the 2000 Non-Officer Plan is to attract and retain qualified personnel, to provide additional incentives to employees and consultants and to promote the success of our business.
906709_11_ITEM8_P120_S2	Pursuant to the 2000 Non-Officer Plan, we may grant or issue non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock and stock bonuses to employees and consultants who are neither Officers nor Directors of Nektar.
906709_11_ITEM8_P120_S3	The maximum term of a stock option under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan is eight years.
906709_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan are determined by our Board of Directors by reference to the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market.
906709_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	There were no remaining options available for grant under this plan as of December 31, 2009.
906709_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we issued RSU awards to certain officers, non-employees, directors, employees and consultants.
906709_11_ITEM8_P123_S1	RSU awards are similar to restricted stock in that they are issued for no consideration; however, the holder generally is not entitled to the underlying shares of common stock until the RSU award vests.
906709_11_ITEM8_P123_S2	Also, because the RSU awards are issued for $0.01 per share, the grant-date fair value of the award is equal to the intrinsic value of our common stock on the date of grant.
906709_11_ITEM8_P123_S3	The RSU awards were issued under both the 2000 Plan and the 2000 Non-Officer Plan and are settled by delivery of shares of our common stock on or shortly after the date the awards vest.
906709_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	Beginning with shares granted during 2005, each RSU award depletes the pool of options available for grant under our equity incentive plans by a ratio of 1:1.5.
906709_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	In February 1994 , our Board of Directors adopted the ESPP pursuant to section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
906709_11_ITEM8_P125_S1	Under the ESPP, 1,500,000 shares of our common stock have been authorized for issuance.
906709_11_ITEM8_P125_S2	The terms of the ESPP provide eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in Nektar through participation in a program of periodic payroll deductions for the purchase of our common stock.
906709_11_ITEM8_P125_S3	Employees may elect to enroll or re-enroll in the ESPP on a semi-annual basis.
906709_11_ITEM8_P125_S4	Stock is purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price on the first day of the enrollment period or the last day of the enrollment period.
906709_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	We sponsor a 401(k) retirement plan whereby eligible employees may elect to contribute up to the lesser of 60% of their annual compensation or the statutorily prescribed annual limit allowable under Internal Revenue Service regulations.
906709_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	The 401(k) plan permits us to make matching contributions on behalf of all participants, up to a maximum of $3,000 per participant.
906709_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recognized $1.0 million, $0.8 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, of compensation expense in connection with our 401(k) retirement plan.

906709_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	The CIC Plan is designed to make certain benefits available to eligible employees of the Company in the event of a change of control of the Company and, following such change of control, an employee s employment with the Company or a successor company is terminated in certain specified circumstances.
906709_11_ITEM8_P127_S2	We adopted the CIC Plan to support the continuity of the business in the context of a change of control transaction.
906709_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	The CIC Plan was not adopted in contemplation of any specific change of control transaction.
906709_11_ITEM8_P128_S1	A brief description of the material terms and conditions of the CIC Plan is provided below.
906709_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	equal to twelve months base salary plus annual target incentive pay, the extension of employee benefits over this severance period and the full acceleration of unvested outstanding equity awards.

906709_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	On December 6, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to all outstanding stock awards held by non-employee directors to provide for full acceleration of vesting in the event of a change of control transaction.
906709_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	We have entered into various license agreements and collaborative research and development agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_11_ITEM8_P131_S1	Under these arrangements, we are entitled to receive license fees, upfront payments, milestone payments when and if certain development or regulatory milestones are achieved, and/or reimbursement for research and development activities.
906709_11_ITEM8_P131_S2	All of our research and development agreements are generally cancelable by our partners without significant financial penalty to the partner.
906709_11_ITEM8_P131_S3	Our costs of performing these services are included in Research and development expense.
906709_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	In accordance with these agreements, we recorded License, collaboration and other revenue as follows (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	On September 20, 2009, we entered into a License Agreement with AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish corporation (AstraZeneca), under which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing, and sublicensable license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, sell and otherwise commercially exploit NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_11_ITEM8_P133_S1	AstraZeneca is responsible for all costs associated with research, development and commercialization and will control product development and commercialization decisions for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.

906709_11_ITEM8_P134_S1	We recognized $6.5 million and $1.5 million in reimbursements from AstraZeneca for technology transfer, clinical supply, and other contract development services during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc.
906709_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	In February 1997, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), under which we granted Roche a worldwide, exclusive license to use certain PEGylation materials in the manufacture of PEGASYS.
906709_11_ITEM8_P136_S1	As a result of Roche exercising a license extension option in December 2009, Roche has the right to manufacture all of its requirements for our proprietary PEGylation materials for PEGASYS and we would perform additional manufacturing, if any, only on an as-requested basis.
906709_11_ITEM8_P136_S2	In connection with Roche s exercise of the license option extension in December 2009, we received a payment of $31.0 million of which we have recognized $5.1 million and $0.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

906709_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	On October 29, 2010, we amended and restated an existing supply agreement by entering into a supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement and a license agreement with Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (together referred to as Amgen).
906709_11_ITEM8_P138_S1	Under the terms of the amended and restated agreement, we guarantee the manufacture and supply of our proprietary PEGylation materials (Polymer Materials) to Amgen in an existing manufacturing suite to be used exclusively for the manufacture of Polymer Materials for Amgen (the Manufacturing Suite) in Nektar s manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama (Facility).
906709_11_ITEM8_P138_S2	This supply arrangement is on a non-exclusive basis (other than the use of the Manufacturing Suite and certain equipment) whereby Nektar is free to manufacture and supply the Polymer Materials to any other third party and Amgen is free to procure the Polymer Materials from any other third party.
906709_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	Amgen including without limitation the Additional Rights described below and manufacturing fees that are calculated based on fixed and variable components applicable to the Polymer Materials ordered by Amgen and delivered by Nektar.
906709_11_ITEM8_P139_S1	Amgen has no minimum purchase commitments.
906709_11_ITEM8_P139_S2	If quantities of the Polymer Materials ordered by Amgen exceed specified quantities, significant additional payments become payable to Nektar in return for Nektar guaranteeing its supply of additional quantities of the Polymer Materials.
906709_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	The term of the amended and restated supply agreement runs through October 29, 2020.

906709_11_ITEM8_P142_S1	As part of the termination we relinquished our rights to future research and development funding and milestone payments as well as to any future royalty payments or manufacturing revenue.
906709_11_ITEM8_P142_S2	Prior to the termination, we were reimbursed for the cost of work performed on a revenue per annual full-time equivalent (FTE) basis, plus out of pocket third party costs.
906709_11_ITEM8_P142_S3	Revenue recognized approximated the cost associated with these reimbursable services and was nil, $0.6 million, and $14.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

906709_11_ITEM8_P143_S2	Prior to the termination, we were reimbursed for the cost of work performed on a revenue per annual FTE basis and out of pocket third party costs, as well as milestone and upfront fees.

906709_11_ITEM8_P152_S2	We also entered into a letter agreement with Pfizer to retain a limited number of Exubera manufacturing personnel at Pfizer s Terre Haute, Indiana, manufacturing facility during March and April 2008.
906709_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	On February 14, 2008, we entered into a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement with Bespak Europe Ltd.

906709_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	On April 9, 2008, we announced that we had ceased all negotiations with potential partners for Exubera and the next generation inhaled insulin program as a result of new data analysis from ongoing clinical trials conducted by Pfizer which indicated an increase in the number of new cases of lung cancer in Exubera patients who were former smokers as compared to patients in the control group who were former smokers.
906709_11_ITEM8_P154_S1	Following the termination of our inhaled insulin programs on April 9, 2008, we terminated our continuation agreements with Tech Group and Pfizer.

906709_11_ITEM8_P155_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized idle Exubera manufacturing capacity costs of nil, nil, and $6.8 million, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM8_P156_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded charges for the impairment of long-lived assets of $12.6 million, nil, and $1.5 million, respectively.

906709_11_ITEM8_P157_S1	The remaining assets at the San Carlos location consist of the building capital lease and related leasehold improvements, which we currently intend to sublease through the lease termination date.
906709_11_ITEM8_P157_S2	As a result of our relocation, we performed an impairment analysis on these assets.
906709_11_ITEM8_P158_S0	flow model of the future estimated net sublease income and recorded an impairment loss of $12.6 million.
906709_11_ITEM8_P158_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the remaining net book value of these assets is $2.1 million.
906709_11_ITEM8_P159_S0	During 2008, we determined that a specialized dryer used in our PEGylation manufacturing facility was not functioning properly and was not being used in operations currently.
906709_11_ITEM8_P159_S1	We performed an impairment analysis and determined the carrying value of the dryer exceeded its fair value based on a discounted cash flow model.
906709_11_ITEM8_P159_S2	As a result, we recorded an impairment loss for the related net book value of $1.5 million.
906709_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	In an effort to reduce ongoing operating costs and improve our organizational structure, efficiency and productivity, we executed workforce reduction plans in May 2007 (2007 Plan) and February 2008 (2008 Plan) designed to streamline the Company, consolidate corporate functions, and strengthen decision-making and execution.
906709_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	The 2007 Plan and 2008 Plan reduced our workforce by approximately 290 full-time employees; both plans were substantially complete at December 31, 2008.
906709_11_ITEM8_P160_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 workforce reduction charges, comprised of severance, medical insurance, and outplacement services, were as follows (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	We issued stock-based awards from our equity incentive plans, which are more fully described in Note 8.
906709_11_ITEM8_P161_S1	Stock-based compensation cost was recorded as follows (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we recorded approximately $0.5 million, $0.8 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to modifications of certain stock grants in connection with employment separation agreements.
906709_11_ITEM8_P162_S1	Generally, the modifications extended the option holder s exercise period beyond the 90 day period after termination and accelerated a portion of the option holder s unvested grants.
906709_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	Stock-based compensation charges are non-cash charges and as such have no impact on our reported cash flows.
906709_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	As of December 31, 2010, total unrecognized compensation expense of $37.1 million related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.87 years.
906709_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following tables list the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions used to calculate the fair value of employee stock options and ESPP purchases.
906709_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grants for periods commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	We have never paid dividends, nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, we used a dividend yield of 0.0%.
906709_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	Our estimate of expected volatility is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock over a historical period commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, we estimated the weighted-average expected life based on the contractual and vesting terms of the stock options, as well as historic cancellation and historic exercise data.
906709_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the weighted-average expected life was determined using the simplified method, in which the expected life was based on the average of the vesting term and the contractual life of the option, as permitted under Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14.D.2.
906709_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	We used this method because we believed that applying historical data for options and awards during these years was not a true reflection of future exercise patterns and timelines.
906709_11_ITEM8_P170_S2	The change in method did not result in a significant difference in weighted average expected life.
906709_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	The table below presents a summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plans (in thousands, except for price per share and contractual life information):
906709_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	Aggregate Intrinsic Value represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $6.30, $2.86, and $2.79, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM8_P173_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $6.8 million, $1.4 million, and nil, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM8_P173_S2	The estimated fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $14.7 million, $9.0 million, and $9.8 million, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	We issued RSU awards to certain officers and employees; the RSU awards granted in 2006 vest upon achievement of pre-determined performance milestones, while the RSU awards granted in 2007 and 2008 have a time-based vesting schedule.
906709_11_ITEM8_P174_S1	We expense the grant date fair value of the RSU awards ratably over the expected service or performance period.
906709_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	We granted 1,088,300 performance-based RSU awards in 2006, which included three pre-determined milestones.
906709_11_ITEM8_P175_S1	The first performance milestone was achieved and the RSU awards were vested and released in 2007.
906709_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	In 2007, we determined the second performance milestone would not be achieved and we reversed previously recorded compensation expense of $2.8 million.
906709_11_ITEM8_P176_S1	We currently expect the third milestone will be achieved in 2013.
906709_11_ITEM8_P176_S2	If our actual experience in future periods differs from these current estimates, we may change our estimate of the period in which the milestone will be achieved and prospectively adjust the amortization period of the stock based compensation expense associated with these awards.
906709_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	A summary of RSU award activity is as follows (in thousands except for per share amounts):
906709_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	Aggregate Intrinsic Value represents the difference between the grant price of the award and the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	For financial reporting purposes, Loss before provision for income taxes, includes the following components (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	In 2010, we received a federal tax refund of $0.5 million relating to fiscal year 2009 as a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which allowed us to utilize previously recorded deferred tax assets.
906709_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	Income tax provision (benefit) related to continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax loss as follows (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	Significant components of our deferred tax assets for federal and state income taxes are as follows (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_11_ITEM8_P184_S1	Because of our lack of U.S. earnings history, the net U.S. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
906709_11_ITEM8_P184_S2	The valuation allowance increased by $24.5 million and $39.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
906709_11_ITEM8_P184_S3	The valuation allowance includes approximately $35.6 million of benefit at both December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 related to stock-based compensation and exercises, prior to the implementation of ASC 515 and 718, that will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized.
906709_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in India are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly, no deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
906709_11_ITEM8_P185_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income tax.
906709_11_ITEM8_P185_S2	At the present time it is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. income taxes that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated.
906709_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	As of December 31, 2010, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $815.6 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2011.
906709_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	We had a total state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $537.9 million, which will begin to expire in 2011.
906709_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
906709_11_ITEM8_P187_S1	The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
906709_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	During January 2011, we sold 19 million shares of our common stock to the public.
906709_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	We do not believe this event will create a change in ownership but future stock activity in combination with the January 2011 stock issuance may create a future ownership change.
906709_11_ITEM8_P188_S2	If a future change in ownership is created, we may be subject to additional limitations on the use of our net operating losses and credits.
906709_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	We have federal research credits of approximately $23.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2019 and state research credits of approximately $13.6 million which have no expiration date.
906709_11_ITEM8_P189_S1	We have federal orphan drug credits of $12.8 million which will begin to expire in 2026.
906709_11_ITEM8_P189_S2	These tax credits are subject to the same limitations discussed above.
906709_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	We have incurred net operating losses since inception and we do not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_11_ITEM8_P190_S1	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
906709_11_ITEM8_P190_S2	If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our effective tax rate would be reduced.
906709_11_ITEM8_P190_S3	We currently have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
906709_11_ITEM8_P190_S4	Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.
906709_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Alabama, India and the U.K.
906709_11_ITEM8_P191_S1	We are currently not the subject of any income tax examinations.
906709_11_ITEM8_P191_S2	Because of net operating loss and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our tax years remain open to examination.
906709_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	We have the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.
906709_11_ITEM8_P193_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, no interest or penalties were required to be recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	We operate in one business segment which focuses on applying our technology platforms to improve the performance of established and novel medicines.
906709_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment.
906709_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	We are comprehensively managed as one business segment by our Chief Executive Officer and his management team.
906709_11_ITEM8_P195_S2	Within our one business segment we have two components, PEGylation technology and pulmonary technology.
906709_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	Our revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
906709_11_ITEM8_P196_S1	Revenue from AstraZeneca AB represented 68% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM8_P196_S2	Two of our partners, AstraZeneca AB and UCB Pharma, represented 35% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2009.
906709_11_ITEM8_P196_S3	Four of our partners, Bayer (including Bayer Healthcare LLC and Bayer Schering Pharma AG), UCB Pharma, Novartis, and Roche represented 24%, 16%, 15%, and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2008.
906709_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_11_ITEM8_P197_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	At December 31, 2010, $71.5 million, or approximately 80%, of the net book value of our property and equipment was located in the United States and $18.3 million, or approximately 20%, was located in India.
906709_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	At December 31, 2009, approximately $64.5 million, or approximately 82%, of the net book value of our property and equipment of $78.3 million was located in the United States and $13.8 million, or approximately 18%, was located in India.
906709_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	On January 24, 2011, we completed the issuance and sale of 19,000,000 shares of our common stock.

906709_11_ITEM8_P199_S3	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data.
906709_11_ITEM8_P200_S1	In our opinion, the unaudited information set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth herein.
906709_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results.
906709_11_ITEM8_P201_S1	We expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
906709_11_ITEM8_P201_S2	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
906709_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	reclassifications have not impacted previously reported revenues, operating loss or net loss.
906709_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	All data is in thousands except per share information.
906709_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	Quarterly loss per share amounts may not total to the year-to-date loss per share due to rounding.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cashflows for the periods presented.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P9_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_11_ITEM9A_P9_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.

906709_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to improve the benefits of drugs for patients.
906709_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, anti-viral and immunology.
906709_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other potential biologic drug candidates.
906709_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	We create our innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of drugs to create new molecular entities.
906709_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule when it is bonded with polymers.
906709_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life, bioavailability, metabolism or distribution of drugs and improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for the patient.
906709_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our most advanced proprietary drug candidate, NKTR-118, is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, currently in Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with non-cancer pain and cancer pain.
906709_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	OIC is a common side effect of prescription opioids when used for chronic pain management.
906709_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) for the global development and commercialization of NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	NKTR-119 is an early stage research and development program that is designed to combine various opioids with NKTR-118.
906709_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	AstraZeneca is responsible for all clinical, regulatory and commercialization costs for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our second most advanced drug candidate, NKTR-102, is a next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor, currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy in a Phase 3 clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), was initiated by us in December 2011.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	The BEACON study is designed to enroll approximately 840 women with metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	Patients in the BEACON study will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either single-agent NKTR-102 or a single agent of physician s choice.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S4	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study will be overall survival, and secondary endpoints will include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S5	NKTR-102 is also being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S6	The Phase 2 clinical study of NKTR-102 in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer completed enrollment of 71 patients in 2009.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S7	The study was further expanded to enroll up to 110 additional women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose disease had progressed after prior treatment with Doxil (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection).
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S8	In November 2011, we announced that enrollment in this expanded Phase 2 study had significantly slowed due to a shortage of Doxil resulting from serious manufacturing issues being experienced by the manufacturer and supplier of Doxil .
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S9	As of February 2012, approximately 94 of the planned 110 patients had been enrolled in the study.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S10	We are currently in the process of compiling the data from this expanded study and performing verification procedures on preliminary interim results from the patients enrolled to date.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S11	Results from this study and communication with government health authorities in both the United States and European Union (E.U.) will guide our future development and regulatory strategy for NKTR-102 in ovarian cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P4_S12	A Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is still enrolling patients, and a Phase 1 study of NKTR-102 in combination with F-fluorouracil/leucovorin is also continuing to enroll patients.
906709_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	We also have several proprietary pre-clinical and clinical drug candidates that are in the pain therapeutic area.
906709_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	NKTR-181 is an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule with a long-acting profile to treat chronic pain that has been designed with the objective of addressing serious CNS-related side effects associated with standard opioid therapies.
906709_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	These CNS-related side effects include abuse liability, sedation and respiratory depression.
906709_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	We have completed two separate Phase 1 clinical studies for NKTR-181 and we are currently preparing for a Phase 2 clinical study that we plan to initiate in mid-2012.
906709_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Phase 2 clinical study design is a randomized, double-blind, efficacy and safety study of NKTR-181 as compared to placebo in patients with chronic pain.
906709_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	NKTR-192 is an orally available mu-opioid analgesic molecule with a short-acting profile to treat acute pain that has been designed with the objective to also address the serious CNS-related side effects associated with standard short-acting opioid therapies.
906709_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	NKTR-192 completed preclinical work in 2011 and we plan to begin a Phase 1 clinical study in 2012 subject to our investigational new drug application (IND) clearing the FDA review period.
906709_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Affymax, Inc., Amgen Inc., Baxter Healthcare, MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck Co., Inc. (through its acquisition of Schering Plough), Pfizer Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche), and UCB Pharma.
906709_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	A total of seven products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or EU, and are currently marketed by our collaboration partners.
906709_12_ITEM1_P8_S4	There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies.
906709_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	We have a significant collaboration with Baxter Healthcare to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	We are providing our PEGylation technology and expertise.
906709_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	Baxter is responsible for all clinical development.
906709_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	The first drug candidate in this collaboration, BAX 855, is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein in Phase 1 clinical development in patients with hemophilia A.
906709_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	In addition to incorporating our PEGylation technology, BAX 855 is also based on Baxter s ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free Method] full-length rFVIII molecule and plasma/albumin-free (PAF) manufacturing process.
906709_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Phase 1 clinical study is a prospective, open-label study that will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BAX 855 in previously-treated patients aged 12 years or older with severe hemophilia A. When used for prophylaxis, Baxter s ADVATE requires patients to infuse every two to three days to reduce the occurrence of bleeding episodes.
906709_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	This Phase 1 clinical study is the first step in assessing whether BAX 855 can be infused less frequently in patients while achieving a similar efficacy and safety profile.
906709_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	If the Phase 1 clinical study is successful, Baxter plans to then initiate Phase 3 studies for BAX 855.
906709_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	We also have a significant collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop BAY41-6551 (NKTR-061, Amikacin Inhale), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_12_ITEM1_P11_S4	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and NKTR-061 drug candidate and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer in August 2007 to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_12_ITEM1_P11_S5	Under the collaboration agreement, we are responsible for all future development of the nebulizer device and clinical and commercial manufacturing and supply of the device.
906709_12_ITEM1_P11_S6	BAY41-6551 completed Phase 2 development and we and Bayer are currently preparing for the start of a Phase 3 clinical study.
906709_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	Bayer and Nektar have been working together to prepare for Phase 3 clinical program for BAY41-6551 following the consummation of the collaboration in August 2007.
906709_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	This program is significantly behind schedule due to the fact that Bayer and Nektar decided to finalize the design of the device for commercial manufacturing prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical development.
906709_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	In 2011, Bayer received agreement with the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 3 clinical studies of BAY41-6551 under the Special Protocol Assessment process that is intended to support the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) if the planned Phase 3 clinical study is successful.
906709_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale and transfer of certain pulmonary technology rights, certain pulmonary collaboration agreements and approximately 140 of our dedicated pulmonary personnel and operations to Novartis Pharma AG.
906709_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	royalties on net sales of the Cipro Inhale (also known as Ciprofloxacin Inhaled Powder or CIP) program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG that we transferred to Novartis as part of the transaction.
906709_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	We also retained certain rights to patents specific to inhaled insulin.
906709_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	We were incorporated in California in 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998.

906709_12_ITEM1_P14_S6	Our Technology Platform As a leader in the PEGylation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include first-generation PEGylation technology as well as new advanced polymer conjugate chemistries that can be tailored in very specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules including many classes of drugs useful in many disease areas.
906709_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Roche s PEGASYS (PEG-interferon alfa-2a) and Amgen s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim).
906709_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that is safely cleared from the body.
906709_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties.
906709_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics.
906709_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	Earlier PEGylation technology applications were limited, in that they could not be used successfully to improve small molecule drugs, antibody fragments and peptides, all of which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology.
906709_12_ITEM1_P16_S4	Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in PEGylation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	Both our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are outlined below: Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates Our customized approaches for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	A primary example of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-118, an orally-available peripheral opioid antagonist that is in Phase 3 clinical studies with our partner AstraZeneca.
906709_12_ITEM1_P18_S5	An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that has completed Phase 1 clinical development.
906709_12_ITEM1_P18_S6	An example of a drug candidate that uses this approach to avoid first-pass metabolism is NKTR-140, a protease inhibitor that is in the early stages of discovery research.
906709_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase both its efficacy and side effect profile.
906709_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy.
906709_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	With our technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	We are using this approach with the oncolytic drug candidate in our pipeline, NKTR-102, a next-generation topoisomerase I-inhibitor, currently in Phase 3 clinical development in metastatic breast cancer, and Phase 2 development in ovarian and colorectal cancers.
906709_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	We are using our advanced polymer conjugation technology-based approach to enable peptides, which are much smaller in size than other biologics, such as proteins and antibody fragments.
906709_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	We are in the early stages of discovery research with a number of peptides that utilize this proprietary approach.
906709_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Peptides are important in modulating many physiological processes in the body.
906709_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Some of the benefits of working with peptides are: they are small, more easily optimized, and can be rapidly investigated for therapeutic potential.
906709_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	However, peptide drug discovery has been slowed by the extremely short half-life and limited bioavailability of these molecules.
906709_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity.
906709_12_ITEM1_P21_S4	Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_12_ITEM1_P21_S5	An example of this is BAX 855, a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 clinical development by our partner Baxter for the treatment of hemophilia A.
906709_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	PEGylated peptidic compound that binds to and stimulates the erythropoietin receptor and thus acts as an erythropoiesis stimulating agent.
906709_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	Peginesatide has completed Phase 3 clinical studies and has been filed for approval with the FDA to treat renal anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis by our partner Affymax, Inc.
906709_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Antibody Fragment Polymer Conjugates This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the Fc domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and E.U.
906709_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	To support this strategy, over the past four years we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of approved drugs as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S4	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S5	We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S6	Enter into Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S7	For example, in December 2010, we decided that we would move NKTR-102 into Phase 3 development in metastatic breast cancer prior to completing a collaboration partnership for this drug candidate.
906709_12_ITEM1_P28_S8	When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas and methods of treatment.

906709_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Overview of Selected Nektar Proprietary Drug Development Programs and Significant Partnered Drug Development Programs NKTR-118 and NKTR-119, License Agreement with AstraZeneca AB In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	Under the terms of this agreement, AstraZeneca made a license payment to us of $125.0 million and AstraZeneca has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	For NKTR-118, we are also entitled to up to $235.0 million upon certain filings and commercial launch milestones for NKTR-118, and $375.0 million in sales milestones if the product achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	With respect to the $235.0 million in milestones due upon certain filings and commercial launch milestones for NKTR-118, when filing occurs in the US and in the EU or Japan, Nektar will be entitled to up to $95.0 million of those milestones.
906709_12_ITEM1_P43_S4	The remaining milestone payments are due upon the commercial launches of NKTR-118 in those regions.
906709_12_ITEM1_P43_S5	For NKTR-119, we are also eligible to receive significant development milestones as well as significant sales milestones if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_12_ITEM1_P43_S6	For both NKTR-118 and NKTR-119, we are also entitled to significant double-digit royalty payments, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales.

906709_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	NKTR-118 is an orally-available peripheral opioid antagonist that is in Phase 3 clinical studies being conducted by AstraZeneca which AstraZeneca calls the KODIAC study.
906709_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	efficacy and safety of NKTR-118 for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with non-cancer pain and cancer pain.
906709_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	The KODIAC study includes two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled efficacy studies (with approximately 630 randomized patients each) and an open-label, randomized, 52-week long-term safety study with a usual care comparator arm.
906709_12_ITEM1_P45_S2	The 12-week efficacy studies will compare response rate among placebo and two different doses of NKTR-118 with primary endpoint at 12 weeks.
906709_12_ITEM1_P45_S3	There is a three month safety extension following one of the two 12-week studies.
906709_12_ITEM1_P45_S4	AstraZeneca is planning global regulatory submissions for NKTR-118, with first regulatory filings for NKTR-118 in the US and EU planned for 2013 if the KODIAC studies are successful.
906709_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Data from a Phase 2 study conducted by us showed that NKTR-118 achieved the primary endpoint of change from baseline in spontaneous bowel movements in patients taking opioids with chronic OIC.
906709_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	The study also showed that there was no apparent reversal of opioid-mediated analgesia with any of the NKTR-118 dose groups, as measured by no change in Numeric Rating Scale pain scores, no evidence of opioid withdrawal, and no increase in mean daily opioid use.
906709_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The most commonly reported side effects from the Phase 2 clinical study of NKTR-118 were dose dependent gastrointestinal-related effects, which were mild and transient.
906709_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	According to the American Pain Society and IMS Health, over 200 million opioid prescriptions are filled in the U.S. annually with annual worldwide sales of opioids exceeding $10 billion.
906709_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Depending on the population studied and the definitions used, OIC occurs in up to 40-90% of patients taking opioids.
906709_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Clinically, OIC is the most prevalent side effect of opioid therapy.
906709_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Currently, there are no specific oral drugs approved or specifically indicated to treat OIC.
906709_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	NKTR-119 is an early stage drug development program that is intended to combine NKTR-118 with selected opioids, with the goal of treating pain without the side effect of constipation traditionally associated with opioid therapy.
906709_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one product based on NKTR-119 and has the right to develop multiple products which combine NKTR-118 with other opioids.
906709_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	We are developing NKTR-102, a next generation topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor, that was designed using our PEGylation technology.
906709_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	NKTR-102 is a novel macromolecular chemotherapeutic designed to enhance the anti-cancer effects of topo I inhibition while minimizing its toxicities.
906709_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	Unlike irinotecan, a first generation topo I inhibitor that exhibits a high initial peak concentration and short half-life, NKTR-102 s unique pro-drug design results in a lowered initial peak concentration of active topo I inhibitor in the blood.
906709_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	The large NKTR-102 molecule is inactive when administered.
906709_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	Over time, the body s natural enzymatic processes slowly metabolize the linkers within the molecule, continuously freeing active drug that then can work to stop tumor cell division through topo I inhibition.
906709_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	In preclinical models, NKTR-102 achieved a 300-fold increase in tumor concentration as compared to irinotecan.
906709_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	Because NKTR-102 is a large molecule, based on preclinical studies we believe that it may penetrate the leaky vasculature within the tumor environment more readily than normal vasculature, concentrating and trapping NKTR-102 in tumor tissue.
906709_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Clinical studies have shown that NKTR-102 has an extended pharmacokinetic profile and remains in circulation throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle, providing sustained exposure to topo I inhibition.
906709_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	NKTR-102 is currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy (145 mg/m2 every 21 days) in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P57_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call BEACON (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), was initiated in December 2011.
906709_12_ITEM1_P57_S2	The BEACON study plans to include approximately 160 investigator sites worldwide including sites in North America, Eastern and Western Europe, and certain countries in Asia/Pacific.
906709_12_ITEM1_P57_S3	The BEACON study plans to enroll approximately 840 patients with metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_12_ITEM1_P57_S4	This study will randomize patients on a 1:1 basis to receive single-agent NKTR-102 or a single agent chosen from a defined set of physician s choice alternatives.
906709_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, prior treatment with eribulin and whether or not the patient has triple negative breast cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study will be overall survival, and secondary endpoints will include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	Secondary endpoints and objectives also include clinical benefit rate, duration of response, pharmacokinetic data, safety profiles, quality-of-life measurements, and pharmacoeconomic implications.
906709_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	Exploratory objectives of the study will include collecting specific biomarker data to correlate with objective tumor response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and selected toxicities.
906709_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than one million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year.
906709_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman s life is a little less than one in eight (12%).
906709_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	In 2011, there were an estimated 230,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States and 460,000 new cases in Europe.
906709_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Metastatic breast cancer refers to cancer that has spread from the breast to distant sites in the body.
906709_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	There are currently no FDA-approved topoisomerase I inhibitors to treat breast cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	NKTR-102 is also being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S2	This clinical study is an open label, randomized, study evaluating two treatment schedules of single-agent NKTR-102 (145 mg/m2 every 14 days or every 21 days).
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S3	Each schedule originally followed a two-stage Simon design and a total of 71 patients were initially included in the study that was completed in the first half of 2010.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S4	In the second half of 2010, we expanded this Phase 2 study to include approximately 50 additional women who had previously received Doxil therapy to continue to evaluate the every 21-day dose schedule of single-agent NKTR-102 in this subset of women.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S5	On March 1, 2011, we announced that we intended to further expand this Phase 2 clinical study by approximately 60 additional patients.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S6	In November 2011, we announced that enrollment in this expanded study had significantly slowed due to a shortage of Doxil resulting from serious manufacturing issues being experienced by the manufacturer and supplier of Doxil .
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S7	As of February 2012, approximately 94 patients of the 110 patients had been enrolled in the study.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S8	We are currently in the process of compiling and performing verification procedures on the preliminary interim results from the patients enrolled to date in this study.
906709_12_ITEM1_P62_S9	Results from this study and communication with government health authorities in both the U.S. and E.U. will guide our future development and regulatory strategy for NKTR-102 in ovarian cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	Ovarian cancer is also a significant health problem for women worldwide.
906709_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	According to the American Cancer Society, in 2012, there will be an estimated 22,280 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed and an estimated 15,500 deaths from ovarian cancer in the United States.
906709_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	Ovarian cancer is the ninth most common cancer among women, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers.
906709_12_ITEM1_P63_S3	It ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
906709_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Historically, less than 40% of women with ovarian cancer are cured.
906709_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	According to the World Health Organization, about 230,000 women globally are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	A NKTR-102 Phase 2 clinical study was initiated in June 2008 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKTR-102 monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene.
906709_12_ITEM1_P65_S1	The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 clinical study in metastatic colorectal cancer is progression-free survival as compared to standard irinotecan monotherapy.
906709_12_ITEM1_P65_S2	According to recent data presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2010, it is estimated that up to 43.5% of colorectal cancer cases have this mutation in the KRAS gene and do not respond to EGFR-inhibitors, such as cetuximab.
906709_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	The Phase 2 clinical study is designed to enroll 174 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	The study is still enrolling and patient enrollment in this study has been challenging due to the fact that the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the U.S. or EU.
906709_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	and the study is still ongoing.
906709_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen.
906709_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.
906709_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 141,210 new cases of colon and rectal cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2011, and about 49,000 people will die annually of the disease.
906709_12_ITEM1_P69_S2	Worldwide, over 1.2 million people are diagnosed annually with colorectal cancer.
906709_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Most metastatic colorectal cancer patients have recurrence within two years and require retreatment with chemotherapy regimens.
906709_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	The majority of metastatic colorectal cancer patients receive irinotecan-based regimens, primarily in combination with 5-FU/leucovorin.
906709_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States when men and women are considered separately, and the second leading cause when both sexes are combined.
906709_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	It was expected to cause about 49,380 deaths (29,001 in men and 20,379 in women) during 2011 in the U.S. Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, there are 690,000 deaths annually from colorectal cancers.

906709_12_ITEM1_P73_S8	Subject to termination fee payment obligations, Bayer also has the right to terminate the agreement for convenience.
906709_12_ITEM1_P73_S9	In addition, the agreement may also be terminated by either party for certain product safety concerns, the product s failure to meet certain minimum commercial profile requirements or uncured material breaches by the other party.
906709_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	BAY41-6551 is in clinical development to treat Gram-negative pneumonias, including hospital-acquired (HAP), healthcare-associated, and ventilator-associated pneumonias.
906709_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	Gram-negative pneumonias are often the result of complications of other patient conditions or surgeries.
906709_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	Gram-negative pneumonias carry a mortality risk that can exceed 50% in mechanically-ventilated patients and accounts for a substantial proportion of the pneumonias in intensive care units today.
906709_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	BAY41-6551 is designed to be an adjunctive therapy to the current antibiotic therapies administered intravenously as standard of care.

906709_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P1_S5	New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Drug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	It will take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete clinical studies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our own financial constraints.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Drug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of clinical development.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The risk of failure is increased for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to small molecules, including NKTR-118, NKTR-119, NKTR-102, NKTR-181, NKTR-192 and other drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S8	The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Even with success in preclinical testing and previously completed clinical trials, the risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S10	A number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in late stage clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy results and adverse medical events, even after achieving positive results in earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing government health authorities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S11	While the NKTR-118, NKTR-102, and Amikacin Inhale drug candidates have each demonstrated positive results from Phase 2 clinical studies, there is a substantial risk that Phase 3 clinical study outcomes from these drug candidates from larger patient populations will not demonstrate positive efficacy, safety or other clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory filings and achieve regulatory approval.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Phase 3 clinical outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of these Phase 3 clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P2_S13	If one or more of these drug candidates fail in Phase 3 clinical studies, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive FDA mandated or equivalent foreign government health authority review process for safety and efficacy.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	This process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The time required for completing testing and obtaining approvals is uncertain, and the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Our partnered drugs that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S7	The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S8	We will need to raise substantial additional capital to repay the $215.0 million in convertible notes due in September 2012 and fund our planned future operations, and we may be unable to secure such capital without dilutive financing transactions.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S9	On February 29, 2012, we received $124.0 million in gross proceeds from the sale of our royalty interest in the CIMZIA and MIRCERA drug products.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S10	Additionally, we incurred approximately $4.5 million in transaction costs.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S11	We plan to use the proceeds from this transaction towards the repayment of our $215.0 million in convertible subordinated notes due in September 2012.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S12	We are actively pursuing other non-dilutive financing alternatives such as the sale of additional royalty interests held by us or term loan arrangements.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S13	We may seek to repurchase our convertible notes through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions and/or a tender offer, if we can do so on attractive terms.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S14	If non-dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, in order to continue future operations as planned, we will be required to pursue dilutive equity-based financing alternatives such as the issuance of convertible debt or common stock to fund the remaining balance of the convertible notes and to provide sufficient capital to fund our future operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S15	The issuance of convertible notes, common stock, preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our securities would dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stock security holders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S16	In addition, a financing could result in the issuance of new securities that may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S17	If we issue convertible notes or enter into a term loan arrangement, the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness may limit funds available for our business activities such as the continued advancement of our research and development pipeline, and such indebtedness could impose covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P4_S18	These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets, as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or make investments.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	If we do not receive substantial milestone payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	As of December 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $414.9 million and indebtedness of approximately $239.9 million, including approximately $215.0 million in convertible subordinated notes due September 2012, $17.0 million in capital lease obligations, and $7.9 million of other liabilities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:
906709_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	A significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate sufficient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant up-front payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of our research and development programs.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The results from the expanded Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-102 in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer are unlikely to result in a review or an approval of a new drug application (NDA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the future results from this trial are difficult to predict.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We expanded the NKTR-102 Phase 2 study by 110 patients in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer that had received prior Doxil therapy with the potential for us to consider an early NDA submission after we evaluate these expanded study results.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	As of February 2012, approximately 94 of the planned 110 patients had been enrolled in the study.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Due to an ongoing supply shortage of Doxil , we do not expect to complete full enrollment of this study.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	We are currently in the process of compiling and performing verification procedures on preliminary interim results from the patients.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Acceptance and approval of an NDA by the FDA almost always requires the sponsor to conduct comparative Phase 3 clinical studies prior to acceptance for review or approval of an NDA.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	As a result, acceptance for review or approval of an accelerated NDA submitted to the FDA based on overall response rate from our single-arm Phase 2 study in platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer would be unusual and is highly unlikely.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Therefore we do not expect the FDA to accept or approve an accelerated NDA based on this Phase 2 clinical study.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The FDA has significant discretion to determine what constitutes a high unmet medical need, what therapies should be considered available to patients regardless of which therapies are approved or typically prescribed in a particular setting, the relevance of certain efficacy end points (e.g. overall response rate, progression free survival, overall survival), and the number of patients required to be studied to demonstrate sufficient therapeutic benefit and safety profile.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	One or more of such judgments and determinations by the FDA could impair our ability to submit an accelerated NDA for platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients, and even if submitted, whether the FDA would accept it for review and/or approve the NDA.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Further, this expansion of our Phase 2 study in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer will necessarily change the final efficacy (e.g., overall response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival) and safety (i.e., frequency and severity of serious adverse events) results, and, accordingly, the final results in this study remain subject to substantial change and could be materially and adversely different from previously announced results.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	If the clinical studies for NKTR-102 ovarian cancer are not successful, it could significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	While we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have not been able to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, there is a risk that in the future a technique could be discovered to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid which would significantly diminish the value of this drug candidate.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	An important objective of our NKTR-181 drug development program is to create a unique opioid molecule that does not rapidly enter a patient s central nervous system and therefore has the potential to be less susceptible to abuse than alternative opioid therapies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	To date, we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have been unable to convert NKTR-181 into a rapidly-acting, more abusable form of opioid.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In the future, an alternative chemistry technique, process or method of administration, or combination thereof, may be discovered to enable the conversion of NKTR-181 into a more abusable opioid which could significantly and negatively impact the potential of NKTR-181.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	For example, in September 2009 we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 that included an upfront payment of $125.0 million.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If we are unable to find suitable partners or to negotiate collaboration arrangements with favorable commercial terms with respect to our existing and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Preliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data becomes available.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	From time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Preliminary data remains subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Interim data is also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data becomes available.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	It is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our successful product candidates following approval by government health authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate or, if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our technology on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In certain cases, we have existing licenses or cross-licenses with third parties, however the scope and adequacy of these licenses is very uncertain and can change substantially during long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be significantly harmed and we may be prevented from developing and selling the drug.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:
906709_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	On September 20, 2009, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca for the further development and commercialization of NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In addition, we have also entered into complex commercial agreements with Novartis in connection with the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business, associated technology and intellectual property to Novartis (the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale), which was completed on December 31, 2008.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, we entered an exclusive license agreement with Novartis Pharma pursuant to which Novartis Pharma grants back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights necessary for us to satisfy certain continuing contractual obligations to third parties, including in connection with development, manufacture, sale and commercialization activities related to our partnered program for Amikacin Inhale with Bayer.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	We also entered into a service agreement pursuant to which we have subcontracted to Novartis certain services to be performed related to our partner program for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Our agreements with AstraZeneca and Novartis contain complex representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations that could result in substantial future liability and harm our financial condition if we breach any of our agreements with AstraZeneca or Novartis or any third party agreements impacted by these complex transactions.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or third-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We could be involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, they could effectively prevent us, or our partners, from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	For instance, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, to which we license our proprietary PEGylation reagent intellectual property for use in the MIRCERA product, was a party to a significant patent infringement lawsuit brought by Amgen Inc. related to Roche s proposed marketing and sale of MIRCERA to treat chemotherapy anemia in the U.S.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In October 2008, a federal court ruled in favor of Amgen, issuing a permanent injunction preventing Roche from marketing or selling MIRCERA in the U.S. Roche and Amgen subsequently entered into a settlement and limited license agreement which allows Roche to begin selling MIRCERA in the U.S. in July 2014.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Currently, the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) seeks to recover amounts it alleges it is owed pursuant to a technology licensing contract between SUNY and us.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	SUNY has filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	However, we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending or future litigation.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Costs associated with such litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Third-party claims involving proprietary rights or other matters could also result in substantial settlement payments or substantial damages to be paid by us.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S5	For instance, a settlement might require us to enter a license agreement under which we would pay substantial royalties or other compensation to a third party, diminishing our future economic returns from the related drug.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S6	In October 2011, we entered into a settlement related to a trade secret and breach of contract litigation where we agreed to make an upfront payment of $2.7 million and a future contingent payment of $3.0 million if a certain drug candidate receives FDA approval.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S7	In 2006, we entered into a litigation settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with the University of Alabama in Huntsville pursuant to which we paid $11.0 million and agreed to pay an additional $10.0 million in equal $1.0 million installments over ten years ending with the last payment due on July 1, 2016.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P20_S8	If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We own greater than 120 U.S. and 420 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be valid and enforceable or that patents for which we apply will issue with broad coverage, if at all.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P21_S4	The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued and, as a consequence, our patent applications may result in patents with narrow coverage that may not prevent competition from similar drugs.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P21_S5	The scope of our patent claim coverage can be critical to our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Further, an issued patent may undergo further proceedings to limit its scope so as not to provide meaningful protection and any claims that have issued, or that eventually issue, may be circumvented or otherwise invalidated.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Any attempt to enforce our patents or patent application rights could be time consuming and costly.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following commercialization of related products.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There are many laws, regulations and judicial decisions that dictate and otherwise influence the manner in which patent applications are filed and prosecuted and in which patents are granted and enforced.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Changes to these laws, regulations and judicial decisions are subject to influences outside of our control and may negatively affect our business, including our ability to obtain meaningful patent coverage or enforcement rights to any of our issued patents.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	New laws, regulations and judicial decisions may be retroactive in effect, potentially reducing or eliminating our ability to implement our patent-related strategies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Changes to laws, regulations and judicial decisions that affect our business are often difficult or impossible to foresee, which limits our ability to adequately adapt our patent strategies to these changes.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S5	We and our contract manufacturers are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S6	We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers adherence to such cGMP regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S8	Failure to comply with applicable regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S9	The results of these inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S10	Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S11	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S12	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient drug quantities meeting applicable quality standards required to support large clinical studies or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner, we risk delaying our clinical studies or those of our collaboration partners, reducing drug sales by our collaboration partners or breaching contractual obligations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P24_S13	As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages, and reduce or even eliminate product or royalty revenue.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturing involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstration of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process validation, and challenges in controlling for all of these variables.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party contract manufacturers required for drug supply to support our clinical studies and the clinical studies and products of our collaboration partners.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Failure by us or our contract manufacturers to supply drug product in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical studies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Failures in device manufacturing has similar effects.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	For instance, we entered a service agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we subcontract to Novartis certain important services to be performed in relation to our partnered program for Amikacin Inhale with Bayer Healthcare LLC.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If our subcontractors do not dedicate adequate resources to our programs, we risk breach of our obligations to our partners.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In the past we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We have experienced repeated significant delays in starting the Phase 3 clinical development program for Amikacin Inhale as we seek to finalize and validate the device design with a demonstrated capability to be manufactured at commercial scale.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	This work is ongoing and there remains significant risk in finalizing, validating, and producing the device at sufficient quantities meeting applicable quality requirements until this work is completed.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Drug/device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient/doctor use, maintenance of clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements from which we receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and manufacturing revenue.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from significant milestone payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch and the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P30_S3	The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	If our partners, on which we depend to obtain regulatory approvals for and to commercialize our partnered drug candidates, are not successful, or if such collaborations fail, the development or commercialization of our partnered drug candidates may be delayed or unsuccessful.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a drug candidate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company is generally expected to:
906709_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	market and sell the drugs when and if they are approved.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of risks to our business, including risks that:
906709_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Given these risks, the success of our current and future partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	We have entered into collaborations in the past that have been subsequently terminated, such as our collaboration with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of inhaled insulin that was terminated by Pfizer in November 2007.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If other collaborations are suspended or terminated, our ability to commercialize certain other proposed product candidates could also be negatively impacted.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of product candidates could be delayed or cancelled, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our products successfully.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P36_S2	To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must either develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P36_S3	If we decide to market our products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or indirectly with our partners include:
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	To the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S3	To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially in our control.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S5	We purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S6	We often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunity or contract liability to third parties.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P37_S7	For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations, and any interruption in supply or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs to the extent we cannot pass on increased costs to a manufacturing customer.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P38_S2	No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P38_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2011, we reported a net loss of $134.0 million.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:
906709_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Such third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P40_S6	A government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Though we are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S4	For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S6	The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Significant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Competitors of our PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technologies include Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd., Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S (formerly assets held by Neose Technologies, Inc.), and NOF Corporation.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing PEGylation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There are several competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in development.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	For Amikacin Inhale, the current standard of care includes several approved intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	For NKTR-118, there are currently several alternative therapies used to address opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD), including subcutaneous Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) and oral and rectal over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	In addition, there are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Adolor Corporation, Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Alkermes, Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	For NKTR-102, there are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for ovarian and breast cancers including but not limited to: Avastin (bevacizumab), Camptosar (irinotecan), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Iniparib, Paraplatin (carboplatin), and Taxol (paclitaxel).
906709_12_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Eli Lilly Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi Aventis, and many others.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There are approved therapies for the treatment of colorectal cancer, including Eloxatin (oxaliplatin), Camptosar (irinotecan), Avastin (bevacizumab), Erbitux (cetuximab), Vectibix (panitumumab), Xeloda (capecitabine), Adrucil (fluorouracil), and Wellcovorin (leucovorin).
906709_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	agents to potentially treat colorectal cancer, including, but not limited to, products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Antigenics, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm Inc., Meditech Research Ltd, Alchemia Limited, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and others.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P48_S3	As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P48_S4	These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P48_S5	If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Our decision to bear a majority or all of the clinical development costs of NKTR-102 substantially increases our future capital requirements.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S8	If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S9	If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S11	We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S12	Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S13	The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P49_S14	The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	products and the regulatory approval process.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, regulatory, finance, marketing and distribution and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S10	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S11	If earthquakes and other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S12	Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S13	In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S14	There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S15	In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, political instability, or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply materials for drug candidates in development and our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S16	Our collaborative partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S17	We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S18	In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S19	We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P50_S20	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Further, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S2	These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market prices.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We also have a change of control severance benefit plan which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S4	This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S5	The price of our common stock is expected to remain volatile.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2011, based on closing bid prices on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our stock price ranged from $12.53 to $4.22 per share.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S7	We expect our stock price to remain volatile.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S8	In addition, as our convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock, volatility or depressed prices of our common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of our notes.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S9	Also, interest rate fluctuations can affect the price of our convertible notes.
906709_12_ITEM1A_P51_S10	A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock or notes, including:
906709_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	We lease a 102,283 square foot facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility), under an operating lease which expires in 2020.
906709_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	In November 2010, we moved into the Mission Bay Facility relocating all of our functions from the San Carlos, California facility (San Carlos Facility), including our corporate headquarters and research and development for our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology operations.
906709_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	In December 2011, we expanded our lease of the Mission Bay Facility to include an additional 24,002 square feet of space.
906709_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, we retain the right to terminate the lease expansion on May 31, 2013.
906709_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	If we do not exercise the early termination right, the lease for the expanded space will expire in 2020, on the same date as the original lease agreement for the Mission Bay Facility.
906709_12_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our lease for approximately 100,000 square feet of the San Carlos Facility is under a capital lease which expires in 2016.
906709_12_ITEM2_P0_S6	We have subleased a portion of the San Carlos Facility and are currently seeking one or more subtenants for the remaining space.
906709_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	Alabama We currently own three facilities consisting of approximately 149,333 square feet in Huntsville, Alabama, which house laboratories as well as administrative, clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities for our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology operations.
906709_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	India We own a research and development facility consisting of approximately 88,000 square feet, near Hyderabad, India.
906709_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	In addition, we lease approximately 504 square feet of office space in Hyderabad, India, under a one-year operating lease that will expire in 2012.
906709_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	On November 18, 2009, the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) filed an action against Nektar in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
906709_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	SUNY seeks to recover amounts it alleges it is owed pursuant to a technology licensing contract between Nektar and SUNY.
906709_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	Discovery in the matter is continuing and a trial ready date has been set for September 1, 2012.
906709_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	We believe that SUNY s claims are without merit.
906709_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	No reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can be made at this time and no liabilities have been recorded for this matter on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011 or 2010.
906709_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NKTR.
906709_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth the high and low closing sales prices for our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the periods indicated.
906709_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders of Record As of February 24, 2012, there were approximately 251 holders of record of our common stock.
906709_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.
906709_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	We currently expect to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
906709_12_ITEM5_P1_S3	There were no sales of unregistered securities and there were no common stock repurchases made during the year ended December 31, 2011.
906709_12_ITEM5_P2_S0	Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans Information regarding our equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2011 is disclosed in Item 12 Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference from our proxy statement for our 2011 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Regulation 14A not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

906709_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_12_ITEM6_P5_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_12_ITEM6_P5_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to improve the benefits of drugs for patients.
906709_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, anti-viral and immunology.
906709_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other potential biologic drug candidates.
906709_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	We create our innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of drugs to create new molecular entities.
906709_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule when it is bonded with polymers.
906709_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life, bioavailability, metabolism or distribution of drugs and improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for the patient.
906709_12_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_12_ITEM7_P1_S4	Our most advanced proprietary product candidate, NKTR-118, is a peripheral opioid antagonist that is currently being evaluated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation.
906709_12_ITEM7_P1_S5	We are a party to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with AstraZeneca for the global development and commercialization of NKTR-118 and NKTR-119.
906709_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	NKTR-119 is an early stage research and development program that is designed to combine various opioids with NKTR-118.
906709_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	On March 15, 2011, AstraZeneca announced enrollment of the first patient in Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-118 that AstraZeneca calls the KODIAC study.
906709_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	This Phase 3 clinical program is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of NKTR-118 as a medicine to relieve opioid-induced constipation, a common side effect of prescription opioids when used for chronic pain management.
906709_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	The outcome of the KODIAC study will have a substantial impact on our financial condition as we are entitled to $235.0 million in regulatory filing and commercial launch milestones.
906709_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	If the KODIAC study is successful and AstraZeneca files for regulatory approval with the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), Nektar will be entitled to $95.0 million of these milestones.
906709_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	We will be entitled to the remaining $140.0 million of these milestones if NKTR-118 is approved by the FDA and EMA and commercial launch is achieved in the U.S. and one major country in the European Union (EU).
906709_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Following the commercial launch of NKTR-118, we are entitled to significant and escalating double-digit royalties varying by country of sale and based on the level of annual net sales.
906709_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	Therefore, the results from the KODIAC study, the timing and outcome of approval review of NKTR-118 by the FDA and EMA, the timing of the commercial launch of NKTR-118 (if approved), and the level of NKTR-118 sales, will have a significant impact on our financial condition and future business prospects.
906709_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our second most advanced drug candidate, NKTR-102, is a next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor, currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), was initiated by us in December 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	The BEACON study is scheduled to enroll approximately 840 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	The BEACON study will require a substantial investment over the next three years.
906709_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	In the first quarter of 2012, we are also completing an expanded Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-102 in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	clinical study was completed in mid-2010 and we further expanded this study to enroll up to 110 additional women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who had progressed after prior treatment with Doxil (doxorubicin HCl liposome injection).
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	In November 2011, we announced that enrollment in this expanded Phase 2 study was slower than anticipated because of a shortage of Doxil related to serious manufacturing issues being experienced by the manufacturer and supplier of Doxil .
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	As of February 2012, approximately 94 of the planned 110 patients had been enrolled in the study.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	We are currently in the process of compiling and performing verification procedures on certain top-line results (i.e. objective tumor response rate) from the patients enrolled to date.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S4	Results from this study and communication with government health authorities in both the United States and EU, will guide our future development and regulatory strategy for NKTR-102 in ovarian cancer.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S5	We also have a significant collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) for Amikacin Inhale, an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, that has completed Phase 2 development.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S6	Preparations for a Phase 3 clinical study, which we currently expect to start in the second half of 2012, are continuing.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S7	The program is significantly behind schedule due to our plan with Bayer to finalize the design of the nebulizer device for commercial manufacturing prior to initiating Phase 3 clinical development, with the objective of commencing Phase 3 clinical trials as soon as possible following completion of this work.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S8	We expect to continue to make significant investments over the next two years in establishing manufacturing capability for the nebulizer device necessary to support the Phase 3 clinical study of this drug candidate and, if such study is successful and the drug candidate is approved by government health authorities, the commercial supply of the nebulizer device.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S9	While the late stage clinical development programs described above are key elements of the future success of our company, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier stage drug candidate pipeline.
906709_12_ITEM7_P5_S10	For example, we plan to advance NKTR-181 into Phase 2 clinical trials in 2012 and we also plan to file an investigational new drug application (IND) for NKTR-192 in 2012.
906709_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	While we believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results and/or receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results is extremely difficult to predict.
906709_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial prospects, financial condition, and market value.
906709_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary PEGylation reagents on a cost-plus or fixed price basis.
906709_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply PEGylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	As a result, whenever possible, we are renegotiating or not seeking renewal of legacy manufacturing supply arrangements that do not include a strategic development or commercialization component.
906709_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	For example, in October 2010, we entered into a supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement with Amgen, Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited, which has significantly amended economic and other terms in the non-exclusive supply and license agreement we previously entered into with Amgen in 1995.
906709_12_ITEM7_P7_S4	In addition, in December 2010, we entered into an amended manufacturing and supply agreement with Merck (through its acquisition of Schering-Plough Corporation) to provide for transfer to an alternative manufacturer and revised economics for an interim supply arrangement until that transition is completed.
906709_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $414.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities and $239.9 million in indebtedness.
906709_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have $215.0 million in outstanding convertible subordinated notes due September 2012.
906709_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital.
906709_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including NKTR-102, NKTR-061, NKTR-181, and NKTR-192 will continue to require significant investments in order to advance through the clinic with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreements and public and private placements of debt and equity securities.
906709_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	While in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration agreements and other significant transactions, we do not currently anticipate completing new transactions with substantial upfront payments in the near future.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	As discussed above, the success of the KODIAC study is critical to providing cash to fund our operations and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this study.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	On February 29, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	Additionally, we incurred approximately $4.5 million in transaction costs.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	While the net proceeds from this transaction will fund more than 50% of the September 2012 repayment obligation for the outstanding convertible notes, we intend to pursue other financing alternatives before the convertible note maturity date which could include the sale of additional royalty interests from legacy agreements or term loan arrangements.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	Where we believe it is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders, we are pursuing financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	However, if non-dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we could be required to pursue dilutive equity-based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	If we are not successful in raising additional funds through financing activities in 2012, we may be required to reduce our research and development spending in one or more programs, as well as general and administrative expenses, in order to conserve working capital until additional funding becomes available either from our existing collaborations, new collaboration partnerships or additional fundraising activities.
906709_12_ITEM7_P10_S7	Our substantial debt, the market price of our common stock, and the general economic and equity market climate, among other factors, could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and could affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing alternatives.
906709_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, license fees, milestone payments or contract research payments.
906709_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	Upfront fees received for license and collaborative agreements are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue.
906709_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations.
906709_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by management to determine the performance periods.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Product sales Product sales include cost-plus and fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	Product sales decreased during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior periods primarily as a result of decreased product demand from our collaboration partners due in part to the transfer of manufacturing activities to certain collaboration partners.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The timing of shipments is based on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	We expect product sales to increase in 2012 compared with 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	Royalty revenues increased during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 compared to the prior periods primarily as a result of the increase in royalties received from Roche s MIRCERA and UCB Pharma s CIMZIA product sales.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S6	During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recognized $8.3 million, $5.4 million, and $2.7 million, respectively, in aggregate royalties from net sales of MIRCERA and CIMZIA .
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S7	As noted above, in February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S8	However, although any future CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalties will go directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests, as this transaction will be recorded as a liability that amortizes over the life of the estimated royalty payment period, we will continue to recognize the royalties as revenue, which we expect to increase in 2012.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S9	License, collaboration and other revenue License, collaboration and other revenue includes amortization of upfront payments and milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S10	The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments, the achievement of milestones, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of reimbursed research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S11	License, collaboration and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the complete recognition as of December 31, 2010 of the $125.0 million upfront payment received in the fourth quarter of 2009 from AstraZeneca in connection with the NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 global license agreement.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S12	This decrease was partially offset by the recognition of a $5.0 million license fee, $6.0 million in milestones earned under existing collaboration agreements, and increases in revenue recognized in 2011 from upfront payments received by us during 2010.
906709_12_ITEM7_P13_S13	We expect license, collaboration and other revenue in 2012 to be consistent with 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the increase in license, collaboration and other revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to recognition of the upfront payment received from AstraZeneca for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 in the fourth quarter of 2009, contract research and other revenue from AstraZeneca, and the recognition of the license extension option payment received from Roche in December 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Under the AstraZeneca license agreement and related technology transfer agreement, we recognized $101.4 million and $23.6 million of the $125.0 million upfront payment and $6.5 million and $1.5 million of contract research and other revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
906709_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	We recognized $5.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of the $31.0 million license extension option payment from Roche for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
906709_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.
906709_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Revenue by geography Revenue by geographic area is based on locations of our partners.
906709_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	The decrease in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 and the increase in the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to the revenue we recognized from the AstraZeneca license agreement.
906709_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	The decrease in cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the $2.5 million decrease in product sales in 2011 and an increase in overall commercial and proprietary manufacturing activity in 2011 compared to 2010 that resulted in decreased costs per unit.
906709_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the different mix of products sold and the decreased costs per unit in 2011 resulting from increased manufacturing activity.
906709_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	The decrease in cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to the $2.7 million decrease in product sales and the inclusion in cost of goods sold in 2009 of a $2.1 million success fee that became due to one of our former consulting firms in 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	The increase to product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to the $2.1 million success fee included in cost of goods sold in 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	As a result of the fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities, we expect product gross margin to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level of manufacturing orders from our customers.
906709_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	However, due to the fixed price nature of certain of our significant supply agreements, we expect that gross margin will decrease in 2012 compared to 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, clinical study costs, direct costs of outside research, materials, supplies, licenses and fees.
906709_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs.
906709_12_ITEM7_P20_S2	The increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to a $7.5 million increase in direct research and development program costs and related materials costs, a $3.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits resulting from increased headcount to support our expanded clinical efforts, and a $6.3 million increase in support and facilities-related costs, which includes increased non-cash depreciation and non-cash rent expenses related to our new facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility).
906709_12_ITEM7_P20_S3	The increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to an $8.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits due to increased headcount to support our expanded clinical development efforts and further investment in and development of proprietary drug candidates in our research and development pipeline.
906709_12_ITEM7_P20_S4	The increase also includes a $3.8 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to our higher stock price and increased headcount, a $3.1 million increase to facilities and equipment costs primarily due to the completion of our India research facility and to the move to our Mission Bay Facility, and a $2.7 million increase in supplies, including clinical trial materials.
906709_12_ITEM7_P20_S5	These expense increases were partially offset by a $5.5 million decrease in outside services, including contract research organizations, due primarily to lower expenses for the NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 programs as a result of our successful completion of Phase 2 clinical studies and collaboration with AstraZeneca pursuant to the license agreement entered into in September 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development projects as well as our research programs directed towards identifying drug candidates based on our technology platform.
906709_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	The following table shows expenses incurred for preclinical study support, contract manufacturing for clinical supplies, clinical and regulatory services provided by third parties and direct materials costs for each of our drug candidates.
906709_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):
906709_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	(1) Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1.
906709_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	(3) Partnered with Bayer Healthcare LLC in August 2007.
906709_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	(4) Partnered with AstraZeneca in 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	In general, all development costs incurred by us after partnering with AstraZeneca are reimbursed by AstraZeneca.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	We expect research and development expense to substantially increase over the next several years.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	We plan to continue to advance NKTR-102 in the BEACON study (metastatic breast cancer) and in Phase 2 clinical studies in ovarian and colorectal cancers.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	Our expanded Phase 2 clinical study in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients is expected to continue throughout 2012.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	Based on our compilation and review of preliminary interim results in the expanded Phase 2 study in ovarian cancer and our communications with government health authorities, we will decide the future of our clinical development efforts in this indication.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S6	At the same time, we continue to advance the Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-102 in colorectal cancer patients.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S7	We will be funding all of the clinical development costs for NKTR-102 without reimbursement from a collaboration partner for the foreseeable future.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S8	The clinical development costs for NKTR-102 will be significant.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S9	Although we are still in the early stages of the BEACON study, we estimate that the total third party and direct material costs over the life of the BEACON study will range from approximately $110.0 million to $120.0 million, of which $14.0 million was paid as of December 31, 2011, and that it will be completed around the end of 2014.
906709_12_ITEM7_P24_S10	We are unable to estimate the dates or costs to complete the clinical development efforts for the ovarian and colorectal cancer indications in which we are studying NKTR-102.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	In addition to our NKTR-102 development activities, in 2012, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-181 that we expect to complete in 2013.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	We also plan to invest in an initial Phase 1 clinical study for NKTR-192 that we expect to complete in 2012.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	In addition, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale-up for the nebulizer devices to supply Bayer for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer, we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	We do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 as AstraZeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	In addition to our drug candidates that we plan to have in clinical development during 2012 and beyond, we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S6	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S7	We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_12_ITEM7_P25_S8	Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
906709_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	In order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development, the drug candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies.
906709_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete.
906709_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
906709_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.
906709_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	Furthermore, our strategy includes entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for NKTR-118, NKTR-119 and Amikacin Inhale.
906709_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	In these situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control.
906709_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.
906709_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Other than for the BEACON study, due to the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	General and administrative expenses are associated with administrative staffing, business development, finance, marketing, and legal.
906709_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, general and administrative expense increased by $2.7 million due to a payment obligation related to the settlement of a commercial litigation matter.
906709_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	In addition, general and administrative expense increased due to personnel-related costs, support and facilities-related costs, and other administrative costs.
906709_12_ITEM7_P29_S3	In 2012, after excluding the impact of the 2011 commercial litigation settlement, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase modestly compared to 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7_P29_S4	General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 remained at a consistent level compared to the year ended December 31, 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we relocated all of our operations previously located in San Carlos, California, including our corporate headquarters, to our Mission Bay Facility in San Francisco, California.
906709_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	We determined that the carrying value of the San Carlos facility exceeded its fair value based on a discounted cash flow model and an impairment charge of $12.6 million was recognized as a result.
906709_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is a result of higher average cash and investment balances partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments.
906709_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decrease in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to lower interest rates earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments.
906709_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 30, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to the complete amortization of deferred financing costs during 2010 from our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes due September 2012.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	As noted above, in February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Although we are required to make payments to the purchaser of these rights only in certain situations, this transaction will be recorded as a liability.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	While we do not anticipate making any cash payments representing interest, we will impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate of approximately 17%.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	As a result, we expect interest expense in 2012 to increase significantly from 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S4	The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily attributable to the complete amortization of deferred financing costs during 2010 from our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes due September 2012 and decreased interest expense from capital leases.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S5	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and research and development contracts, as well as public and private placements of debt and equity.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S6	As of December 31, 2011, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of $414.9 million and indebtedness of $239.9 million, including $215.0 million of convertible subordinated notes, $17.0 million in capital lease obligations and $7.9 million in other liabilities.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S7	Additionally at December 31, 2011, we had letter of credit arrangements with certain financial institutions and vendors, including our landlord, totaling $2.4 million.
906709_12_ITEM7_P32_S8	These letters of credit will expire during 2012 and are secured by investments of similar amounts.
906709_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	On February 29, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Additionally, we incurred approximately $4.5 million in transaction costs.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	While the net payments from this transaction will fund more than 50% of the September 2012 repayment obligation for the outstanding convertible notes, we intend to pursue other financing alternatives before the convertible note maturity date which could include the sale of additional royalty interests or term loan arrangements.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	We may also seek from time to time to purchase or retire our outstanding convertible notes through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other of our securities in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions and/or a tender offer, if we can do so on attractive terms.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	We will evaluate financing alternatives, if any, in light of the then-existing market conditions.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S5	Where we believe it is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders, we are pursuing financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S6	However, if non-dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we could be required to pursue dilutive equity-based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S7	In addition, we expect the Phase 3 clinical trials of NKTR-102 to require particularly significant resources because we anticipate bearing a majority or all of the development costs for that drug candidate.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S8	If we are not successful in raising additional funds through financing activities in 2012, we may be required to reduce our research and development spending in one or more programs, as well as general and administrative expenses, in order to conserve working capital until additional funding becomes available either from our existing collaborations or additional fundraising activities.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S9	Our substantial debt, the market price of our common stock, and the general economic and equity market climate, among other factors, could substantially weaken our financial condition and could reduce or eliminate our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing alternatives.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S10	Please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, We may need to raise substantial additional capital to repay the $215.0 million in convertible notes due in September 2012 and fund our future operations, and we may be unable to secure such capital without dilutive financing transactions and We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S11	If we do not receive substantial milestone payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaboration partnerships, or if we are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S12	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2012, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S13	These investments are generally held to maturity, which is less than two years.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S14	However, if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S15	At December 31, 2011, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately ten months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed twenty-four months.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S16	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S17	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S18	Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $113.7 million, which includes $7.0 million for semi-annual interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes, $11.2 million of prepayments to certain vendors in our BEACON study, and $125.0 million of other net operating cash uses, partially offset by the receipt of $29.5 million from collaboration agreements, of which $16.5 million was included in accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 resulting from an upfront payment obligation arising from an amendment to one of our manufacturing and supply agreements.
906709_12_ITEM7_P34_S19	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront payments received, if any, will increase in 2012 as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs and, in particular, our BEACON study.
906709_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in operating activities totaled $55.9 million, which primarily consisted of spending on operating costs and expenses and includes $7.0 million for interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes, and was partially offset by a $50.0 million upfront payment received from Amgen under the supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement that we entered into with Amgen in October 2010.
906709_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2009, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $39.7 million, which included the $125.0 million upfront payment received from AstraZeneca under the license agreement we entered into for NKTR-118 and NKTR-119 and a $31.0 million license extension payment received from Roche in December 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	Cash flows from investing activities We purchased $9.7 million, $31.5 million, and $16.4 million of property and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
906709_12_ITEM7_P35_S3	Additionally, we made advanced payments on property and equipment purchases of $4.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P35_S4	Our capital expenditures increased in 2010, as we constructed the leasehold improvements for the Mission Bay Facility and completed our research and development facility in Hyderabad, India.
906709_12_ITEM7_P35_S5	We expect our capital expenditures in 2012 to be consistent with 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain pulmonary assets to Novartis for a purchase price of $115.0 million.
906709_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We paid $0.2 million in transaction costs related to the sale during the year ended December 31, 2008 and $4.4 million in transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2009.
906709_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	On January 24, 2011, we completed a public offering of our common stock with gross proceeds of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	As part of the public offering, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $4.5 million, $8.9 million, and $4.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
906709_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 7 of Item 8.
906709_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	(2) These amounts primarily result from capital lease obligations arising from our office space lease at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California.
906709_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	result of the relocation of all of our California functions, including our corporate headquarters and an R D center, to our Mission Bay Facility.
906709_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	We have subleased a portion of the San Carlos Facility and are currently seeking one or more subtenants for the remaining space.
906709_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	This is further discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	(3) In November 2010, we moved into our Mission Bay Facility, which includes our corporate headquarters and an R D center.
906709_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Under the terms of the sublease we entered into with Pfizer Inc. on September 30, 2009 for the Mission Bay Facility, we will begin making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014.
906709_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	On December 28 2011, we amended the sublease of the Mission Bay Facility to include an additional 24,002 square feet of space.
906709_12_ITEM7_P40_S3	Under the terms of the amendment, beginning January 1, 2012, we will begin making lease payments for this additional space of $40,000 per month until May 31, 2013.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in securities with maturities of two years or less and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1.7 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2011.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $0.6 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2010.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2012, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These investments are generally held to maturity, which is less than two years.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	However, if the need arose to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2011, we held $399.6 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of ten months.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we currently do not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Accordingly, we believe there are no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities and have not recorded any provisions for impairment.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_12_ITEM7A_P3_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.

906709_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

906709_12_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P4_S3	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

906709_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across several therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology.
906709_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our research and development activities involve both small molecule and biologic drug candidates.
906709_13_ITEM1_P1_S2	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule when it is bonded with polymers.
906709_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs.
906709_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Our most-advanced proprietary drug candidate, naloxegol (formerly known as NKTR-118), is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, which has completed Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with non-cancer pain.
906709_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	OIC is a common side effect of prescription opioids when used for chronic pain management.
906709_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) for the global development and commercialization of naloxegol and naloxegol fixed-dose combination products.
906709_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	On November 12, 2012, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results for naloxegol from two Phase 3 clinical studies and one safety extension study.
906709_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	On February 26, 2013, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results from the long-term safety clinical study of naloxegol in patients with OIC.
906709_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	The naloxegol fixed-dose combination program, formerly known as the NKTR-119 program, is an early stage research and development program that is designed to combine various opioids with naloxegol.
906709_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	AstraZeneca is responsible for all clinical, regulatory and commercialization costs for both the naloxegol drug candidate and all drug candidates within the naloxegol fixed-dose combination program.
906709_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our second-most-advanced drug candidate, etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), is a next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor, currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical study as a single-agent therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), was initiated by us in December 2011.
906709_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	The BEACON study is designed to enroll approximately 840 women with metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	Patients in the BEACON study are randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either single-agent etirinotecan pegol or a single agent of physician s choice.
906709_13_ITEM1_P7_S4	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	In November 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated etirinotecan pegol as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer progressing after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	In the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed a Phase 2 clinical study of single-agent etirinotecan pegol in approximately 170 women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
906709_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Results from this study and communication with government health authorities in both the United States (U.S.) and European Union (E.U.) will guide our future development and regulatory strategy for etirinotecan pegol in ovarian cancer.
906709_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	A Phase 1 study to evaluate etirinotecan pegol in combination with 5-Fluorouracil/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers has also been completed, and a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating etirinotecan pegol as a single agent in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is enrolling patients.
906709_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma being conducted at the Stanford Cancer Institute.
906709_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	On February 5, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer being conducted at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
906709_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	Our third-most-advanced proprietary drug candidate, NKTR-181, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	Enrollment in this study is ongoing with a design to enroll approximately 200 patients in a randomized controlled study to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	NKTR-181 is designed to be a novel, orally-available mu-opioid agonist molecule with a long-acting profile.
906709_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	The molecule has been designed to have a slow rate of entry into the brain, which is expected to reduce the attractiveness of the molecule as a target of abuse and reduce other serious central nervous system (CNS)-related side effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, which are commonly associated with standard opioid therapies.
906709_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	As a new molecular structure, NKTR-181 s abuse deterrent property does not rely on a formulation approach, a common method used with opioid drugs to reduce their ease of conversion into abusable forms of an opioid.
906709_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	In May 2012, the development program for NKTR-181 for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.
906709_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	We also have additional proprietary preclinical and clinical drug candidates being developed for pain relief.
906709_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	NKTR-192 is designed to be a novel orally available mu-opioid analgesic molecule with a short-acting profile to treat acute pain.
906709_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	This molecule is designed to address the serious CNS-related side effects associated with standard short-acting opioid therapies.
906709_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	NKTR-192 is in Phase 1 clinical development.
906709_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	NKTR-171 is a novel, orally-available sodium channel blocker and is being developed as a treatment for neuropathic pain.
906709_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	NKTR-171 is designed to be peripherally-acting in order to avoid the serious CNS-related side effects associated with existing sodium channel blockers.
906709_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	The product candidate is currently undergoing investigational new drug application (IND)-enabling studies in preparation for clinical studies in healthy volunteers.
906709_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	We have a significant collaboration with Baxter Healthcare to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	Under the terms of this collaboration, we are providing our PEGylation technology and expertise and Baxter is responsible for all clinical development.
906709_13_ITEM1_P13_S5	The first drug candidate in this collaboration, BAX 855, is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein which has completed Phase 1 clinical development in patients with hemophilia A.
906709_13_ITEM1_P13_S6	In February 2013, Baxter initiated a Phase 3 multi-center, open-label clinical study called PROLONG-ATE that will enroll more than 100 previously treated adult patients with severe hemophilia A to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BAX 855 for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding.
906709_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	We also have a significant collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and NKTR-061 drug candidate and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer in August 2007 to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	The stability studies on the nebulizer device that needed to be completed prior to the start of the Phase 3 clinical study were successfully completed in February 2013.
906709_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	The Phase 3 clinical program is expected to be initiated by Bayer in March 2013.
906709_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	In 2011, Bayer achieved agreement with the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 3 clinical studies of BAY41-6551 under the Special Protocol Assessment process that is intended to support the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) if the planned Phase 3 clinical study is successful.
906709_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Affymax, Inc., Amgen Inc., MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck Co., Inc. (through its acquisition of Schering Plough), Pfizer Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche), and UCB Pharma.
906709_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	and are currently marketed by our collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies.
906709_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale and transfer of certain pulmonary technology rights, certain pulmonary collaboration agreements and approximately 140 of our dedicated pulmonary personnel and operations to Novartis Pharma AG.
906709_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	We retained all of our rights to BAY41-6551 and our right to receive royalties on net sales of the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG that we transferred to Novartis as part of the transaction.
906709_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	In August 2012, Bayer initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The two placebo-controlled trials, RESPIRE-1 and RESPIRE-2, are enrolling up to 600 patients and will evaluate Cipro DPI as a chronic, intermittent therapy over a period of 48 weeks.
906709_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	We were incorporated in California in 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998.
906709_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	We maintain our executive offices at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South, San Francisco, California 94158, and our main telephone number is (415) 482-5300.
906709_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Our website is located at www.nektar.com.
906709_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated in, this Annual Report.
906709_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	Our Technology Platform As a leader in the PEGylation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer conjugate chemistries and polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules including many classes of drugs targeting many disease areas.
906709_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Roche s PEGASYS (PEG-interferon alfa-2a).
906709_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body.
906709_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties.
906709_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics.
906709_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	These techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology.
906709_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in PEGylation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
906709_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	Both our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
906709_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates Our customized approaches for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	Two primary examples of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier are naloxegol, an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that is in late stage clinical development in collaboration with AstraZeneca, and NKTR-171, a novel peripherally-acting sodium channel blocker that is currently in IND-enabling studies for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
906709_13_ITEM1_P23_S4	An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile.
906709_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy.
906709_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	With our technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	We are using this approach with the oncolytic drug candidate in our pipeline, etirinotecan pegol, a next-generation topoisomerase I-inhibitor, currently in Phase 3 clinical development in metastatic breast cancer, and Phase 2 clinical development in ovarian and colorectal cancers.
906709_13_ITEM1_P24_S4	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_13_ITEM1_P24_S5	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity.
906709_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	rational drug design, a protein or peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	An example of this is BAX 855, a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical development in collaboration with Baxter for the treatment of hemophilia A. Antibody Fragment Polymer Conjugates This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_13_ITEM1_P25_S2	The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the Fc domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_13_ITEM1_P25_S3	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and E.U.
906709_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	To support this strategy, over the past five years we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of approved drugs as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S4	Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S5	We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S6	Enter into Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_13_ITEM1_P29_S7	For example, in December 2010, we decided that we would move etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) into Phase 3 clinical development in metastatic breast cancer prior to completing a collaboration partnership for this drug candidate.
906709_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.
906709_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	The following table summarizes our proprietary drug candidates that are being developed by us or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies.

906709_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	* In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA effective as of January 1, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	** Amgen Inc. prevailed in a patent lawsuit against F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and as a result of this legal ruling Roche is currently prevented from marketing MIRCERA in the U.S. until July 2014.
906709_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with Roche is terminated or expires.
906709_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	This drug candidate was developed using our proprietary pulmonary delivery technology that was transferred by us to Novartis in an asset sale transaction that closed on December 31, 2008.
906709_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	As part of the transaction, Novartis assumed our rights and obligations for Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale) under our agreements with Bayer Schering Pharma AG; however, we maintained the rights to receive royalties on commercial sales of Cipro DPI if the drug candidate is approved.
906709_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	With respect to all of our collaboration and license agreements with third parties, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell naloxegol and naloxegol fixed-dose combination products.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Under the terms of this agreement, AstraZeneca made an initial license payment to us of $125.0 million and AstraZeneca has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for naloxegol and naloxegol fixed-dose combination products.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	For naloxegol, we are also entitled to up to $235.0 million upon certain filings and commercial launch milestones, and $375.0 million in sales milestones if the product achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	With respect to the $235.0 million in milestone payments due upon certain filings and commercial launch milestones for naloxegol, when filing occurs in the U.S. and in the E.U., we will be entitled to receive $95.0 million of those milestones.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	The remaining milestone payments are due upon the commercial launches of naloxegol in those regions.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S5	For the naloxegol fixed-dose combination products, we are also eligible to receive significant development milestones as well as significant sales milestone payments if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S6	For both naloxegol and the fixed-dose combination products, we are also entitled to significant double-digit royalty payments, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales.
906709_13_ITEM1_P46_S7	Our right to receive royalties (subject to certain adjustments) in any particular country will expire upon the later of (a) specified period of time after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or (b) the expiration of patent rights in that particular country.
906709_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one naloxegol fixed-dose combination product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine naloxegol with other opioids.
906709_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Naloxegol is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist being investigated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications.
906709_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors.
906709_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur.
906709_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
906709_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Globally, approximately 40 50% (28-35 million) patients taking opioids for long-term pain develop constipation.
906709_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	It is estimated that approximately 40 50% (11-18 million) of those OIC sufferers achieve the desired treatment outcomes with current options that include over-the-counter and prescription laxatives.
906709_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	AstraZeneca has completed a Phase 3 clinical program for naloxegol AstraZeneca calls the KODIAC studies.
906709_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The KODIAC studies (KODIAC-04, KODIAC-05, KODIAC-07 and KODIAC-08) evaluated the efficacy and safety of naloxegol for treating OIC in patients with non-cancer pain.
906709_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	KODIAC-04 and KODIAC-05 were replicate, multicenter- randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials of 12 weeks duration that evaluated 12.5 mg and 25 mg naloxegol administered once-daily.
906709_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	The primary endpoint in both trials was percentage of OIC responders versus placebo over 12 weeks of treatment.
906709_13_ITEM1_P52_S4	The studies enrolled approximately 630 patients each.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	KODIAC-07 was a three-month safety extension of KODIAC-04.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	All three studies were conducted in patients with non-cancer pain and documented OIC, who required daily opioid therapy.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	On November 12, 2012, AstraZeneca reported top-line efficacy and safety results from KODIAC-04, -05 and -07.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	For both KODIAC-04 and -05, the 25 mg dose of naloxegol demonstrated statistically significant results for the primary endpoint.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S4	In KODIAC-04, the 12.5 mg dose of naloxegol demonstrated statistically significant results for the primary endpoint and in KODIAC-05 the 12.5 mg dose did not meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S5	The safety analyses also showed no clinically relevant imbalances in serious adverse events (SAEs), including externally adjudicated major cardiovascular events, across the three treatment arms in KODIAC-04, -05 and -07.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S6	The most common adverse events (AEs) in the naloxegol treatment arms in both trials were abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S7	In KODIAC-07, the safety extension of KODIAC-04, the occurrence of AEs and SAEs was lower than in KODIAC-04 and -05.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S8	All other common AEs were distributed similarly across the three treatment arms.
906709_13_ITEM1_P53_S9	In KODIAC-04 and -05 for either naloxegol dose, compared to placebo, there were no significant differences in change from baseline in mean daily pain scores or mean total daily opioid dose.
906709_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	KODIAC-08 was an open-label, randomized, 52-week, long-term safety trial of naloxegol versus usual care (UC) in patients with non-cancer related pain and OIC.
906709_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	This trial was designed to evaluate the long-term safety and adverse event profile of naloxegol in patients taking 25 mg of naloxegol once daily, as compared to UC.
906709_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	In the trial, a total of 534 patients received naloxegol once daily for up to 52 weeks, while 270 patients received UC for OIC during the same treatment period.
906709_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	UC was defined as the investigator s choice of an existing laxative treatment regimen for OIC.
906709_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	On February 26, 2013, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results from KODIAC-08.
906709_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	The trial reported no imbalances in SAEs.
906709_13_ITEM1_P55_S2	In addition, there were a low number of major adverse cardiovascular events, as adjudicated by an independent external committee, and there was no imbalance of these events across naloxegol and UC arms.
906709_13_ITEM1_P55_S3	There were no increases from baseline levels in mean daily pain scores or mean total daily opioid dose in either the naloxegol or the UC arm.
906709_13_ITEM1_P55_S4	Additionally, there were no reports of opioid withdrawal AEs which could be attributed to naloxegol.
906709_13_ITEM1_P55_S5	The most commonly reported AEs occurring more frequently on naloxegol than on UC included abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and headache.
906709_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	AstraZeneca has stated that it plans to submit an NDA filing in the U.S. and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) filing in the E.U. in the third quarter of 2013, pending AstraZeneca s final preparation of the registration package and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
906709_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	Naloxegol is currently considered a Schedule II controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) based on structural relatedness to noroxymorphone.
906709_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	AstraZeneca has conducted the studies necessary to evaluate the abuse potential and dependence-producing properties of naloxegol in support of obtaining decontrol.
906709_13_ITEM1_P57_S2	A petition for the decontrol of naloxegol was submitted to the DEA in March 2012 and subsequently accepted for review.
906709_13_ITEM1_P57_S3	Commercialization and launch in the U.S. will be subject to both FDA approval and DEA schedule determination.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Drug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	It will take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete clinical studies.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our and our partners financial constraints.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Drug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of clinical development.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The risk of failure increases for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to small molecules, including naloxegol, etirinotecan pegol, NKTR-181, NKTR-192, NKTR-171 and other drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S9	If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P2_S10	We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive FDA mandated or equivalent foreign government health authority review process for safety and efficacy.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The time required for obtaining regulatory decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The FDA and other U.S. and foreign health authorities have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Further, health authorities have the discretion to analyze data using their own methodologies that may differ from those used by us or our partners which could lead such authorities to arrive at different conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	For example, we understand that the FDA is exploring whether there is any evidence of a potential cardiovascular class effect related to opioid withdrawal associated with mu-opioid antagonists and naloxegol is a mu-opioid antagonist.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Although AstraZeneca has completed comprehensive safety studies for naloxegol as part of the KODIAC development program and the results from these studies are positive, the health authorities retain significant discretion over regulatory requirements which remain very uncertain and difficult to predict prior to obtaining approval.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Even with success in previously completed clinical trials, the risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	A number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in late stage clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy or safety, even after achieving positive results in earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing government health authorities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	While etirinotecan pegol, Amikacin Inhale, and BAX 855 have each demonstrated positive results from Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies, there is a substantial risk that Phase 3 clinical study outcomes for these drug candidates from larger patient populations will not demonstrate positive efficacy, safety or other clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory filings and achieve regulatory approval.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Phase 3 clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of these Phase 3 clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P4_S6	If one or more of these drug candidates fail in Phase 3 clinical studies, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We are a party to certain significant agreements including an asset purchase agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we sold a significant portion of our pulmonary business at the end of 2008, the worldwide exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca related to the further development and commercialization of naloxegol, and the purchase and sale agreement with RPI Finance Trust (RPI) related to the sale of our royalty interests in UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA that we completed in February 2012.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	could result in substantial future liability and harm our financial condition if we breach any of our agreements with Novartis, AstraZeneca, RPI or any third party agreements impacted by these complex transactions.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or third-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If we do not receive substantial milestone payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	As of December 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $302.2 million and indebtedness of approximately $149.0 million, including approximately $125.0 million in senior secured notes due July 2017, $14.6 million in capital lease obligations, and $9.4 million of other liabilities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	In addition, at December 31, 2012, we had a $131.3 million liability related to the sale of future royalties.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S6	While this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash, we may be required to make a payment of up to $7.0 million in 2014 if the worldwide net sales thresholds of MIRCERA in 2013 are not met.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P8_S7	While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	if and when we receive potential milestone payments and royalties from our existing collaborations if the drug candidates subject to those collaborations achieve clinical, regulatory or commercial success.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate sufficient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant up-front payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant up-front payments and we choose to continue our main research and development programs, we may need to pursue financing alternatives, including dilutive equity-based financings, such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock, which would dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of our research and development programs.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The results from the expanded Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer are unlikely to result in a review or an approval of a NDA by the FDA.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We expanded the etirinotecan pegol Phase 2 study by 110 patients in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer that had received prior Doxil therapy with the potential for us to consider an early NDA submission after we evaluate these expanded study results.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We are currently in the process of compiling and performing verification procedures on the data from this study.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Acceptance and approval of an NDA by the FDA almost always requires the sponsor to conduct comparative Phase 3 clinical studies prior to acceptance for review or approval of an NDA.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	As a result, acceptance for review or approval of an accelerated NDA submitted to the FDA based on overall response rate from our single-arm Phase 2 study in platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer would be unusual and is highly unlikely.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Therefore we do not expect the FDA to accept or approve a NDA based on this Phase 2 clinical study.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The FDA has significant discretion to determine what constitutes a high unmet medical need, what therapies should be considered available to patients regardless of which therapies are approved or typically prescribed in a particular setting, the relevance of certain efficacy end points (e.g. overall response rate, progression free survival, overall survival), and the number of patients required to be studied to demonstrate sufficient therapeutic benefit and safety profile.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	One or more of such judgments and determinations by the FDA could impair our ability to submit an NDA for platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer patients, and even if submitted, whether the FDA would accept it for review or approve the NDA.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Further, this expansion of our Phase 2 clinical study in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer will necessarily change the final efficacy (e.g., overall response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival) and safety (i.e., frequency and severity of serious adverse events) results, and, accordingly, the final results in this study remain subject to substantial change and could be materially and adversely different from previously announced results.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If the clinical studies for etirinotecan pegol ovarian cancer are not successful, it could significantly harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have not been able to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, there is a risk that in the future a technique could be discovered to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid which would significantly diminish the value of this drug candidate.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	An important objective of our NKTR-181 drug development program is to create a unique opioid molecule that does not rapidly enter a patient s central nervous system and therefore has the potential to be less susceptible to abuse than alternative opioid therapies.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	To date, we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have been unable to convert NKTR-181 into a rapidly-acting, more abusable form of opioid.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	or combination thereof, may be discovered to enable the conversion of NKTR-181 into a more abusable opioid which could significantly and negatively impact the potential of NKTR-181.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The timing of new collaboration partnerships is difficult to predict due to availability of clinical data, the outcomes from our clinical studies, the number of potential partners that need to complete due diligence and approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P16_S3	If we are unable to find suitable partners or to negotiate collaboration arrangements with favorable commercial terms with respect to our existing and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Preliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data becomes available.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	From time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For example, we have announced preliminary tumor response rate data from our expanded Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Preliminary data remains subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Interim data is also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data becomes available.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Delays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us or our partners could result in delay in regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S7	We or our partners may experience delays in clinical trials of drug candidates.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Etirinotecan pegol and BAX 855 are currently in Phase 3 clinical studies and Bayer plans to advance Amikacin Inhale into Phase 3 clinical development in March 2013.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S9	In addition, we are conducting a Phase 2 study for NKTR-181 that we estimate will be completed in mid-2013 and we also plan to start a human abuse liability study for NKTR-181 during the first half of 2013.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S10	These and other of our planned clinical studies may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Our clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	any change in health authorities policies or guidances applicable to our drug candidates.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If initiation or completion of any of the planned clinical studies are delayed for our drug candidates for any of the above reasons or otherwise, the approval process could be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of these drug candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	It is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our successful product candidates following approval by government health authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate or, if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P19_S4	We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In certain cases, we have existing licenses or cross-licenses with third parties, however the scope and adequacy of these licenses is very uncertain and can change substantially during long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P20_S5	If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be prevented from developing and selling the drug, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P20_S6	If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We own more than 150 U.S. and 500 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant and/or broad coverage).
906709_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of a products encompassed by our patent(s).
906709_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P22_S5	There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply would actually issue as a patents, or do so with commercially relevant and/or broad coverage.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S2	An adverse outcome in any judicial proceeding involving intellectual property, including patents, could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our ability to freely commercialize our technologies and/or products.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S4	We could be involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S5	From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S6	The third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, they could effectively prevent us, or our partners, from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Currently, the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) seeks to recover amounts it alleges it is owed pursuant to a technology licensing contract between SUNY and us.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	SUNY has filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	However, we cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any pending or future litigation.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Costs associated with such litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Third-party claims involving proprietary rights or other matters could also result in substantial settlement payments or substantial damages to be paid by us.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	For instance, a settlement might require us to enter a license agreement under which we would pay substantial royalties or other compensation to a third party, diminishing our future economic returns from the related drug.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P26_S6	In October 2011, we entered into a settlement related to a trade secret and breach of contract litigation where we agreed to make an upfront payment of $2.7 million and a future contingent payment of $3.0 million if a certain drug candidate receives FDA approval.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	pursuant to which we paid $11.0 million and agreed to pay an additional $10.0 million in equal $1.0 million installments over ten years ending with the last payment due on July 1, 2016.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	In addition, from time to time, we may in the future assert claims against third parties, based on infringement of our proprietary rights or otherwise.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Any such claims may not ultimately be successful, and we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in pursuing them.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to laws and other governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	We and our contract manufacturers are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and with laws and regulations governing manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and are subject to inspections by the FDA, DEA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers adherence to such cGMP and other laws and governmental regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S7	Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S8	The results of these inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S9	Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S10	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S11	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient drug quantities meeting applicable quality standards required to support large clinical studies or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner, we risk delaying our clinical studies or those of our collaboration partners, reducing drug sales by our collaboration partners or breaching contractual obligations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P27_S12	As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages, and reduce or even eliminate product or royalty revenue.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In some cases, we rely on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply drug product for our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturing involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstration of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process validation, and challenges in controlling for all of these variables.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party contract manufacturers required for drug supply to support our clinical studies and the clinical studies and products of our collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Failure by us or our contract manufacturers to supply drug product in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical studies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Failures in device manufacturing could have similar effects.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	For instance, we entered a service agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we subcontract to Novartis certain important services to be performed in relation to our partnered program for Amikacin Inhale with Bayer Healthcare LLC.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	If our subcontractors do not dedicate adequate resources to our programs, we risk breach of our obligations to our partners.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In the past we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We experienced repeated significant delays in starting the Phase 3 clinical development program for Amikacin Inhale as we sought to finalize and validate the device design with a demonstrated capability to be manufactured at commercial scale.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Drug/device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient and doctor use, maintenance of clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements from which we receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and manufacturing revenue.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from significant milestone payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch and the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	If our partners, on which we depend to obtain regulatory approvals for and to commercialize our partnered drug candidates, are not successful, or if such collaborations fail, the development or commercialization of our partnered drug candidates may be delayed or unsuccessful.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a drug candidate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company is generally expected to:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	market and sell the drugs when and if they are approved.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of risks to our business, including risks that:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Given these risks, the success of our current and future partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S2	We have entered into collaborations in the past that have been subsequently terminated, such as our collaboration with Pfizer for the development and commercialization of inhaled insulin that was terminated by Pfizer in November 2007.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If other collaborations are suspended or terminated, our ability to commercialize certain other proposed product candidates could also be negatively impacted.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S4	If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of product candidates could be delayed or cancelled, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S5	If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our products successfully.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S6	We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S7	To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must either develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S8	If we decide to market our products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P37_S9	Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or indirectly with our partners include:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	To the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially in our control.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunity or contract liability to third parties.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S6	For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations, and any interruption in supply or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs to the extent we cannot pass on increased costs to a manufacturing customer.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S7	We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S8	We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S9	No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S10	In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S11	Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S12	We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P39_S13	For the year ended December 31, 2012, we reported a net loss of $171.9 million.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Such third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	A government or third- party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S7	We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S9	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S10	Though we are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S11	For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trials, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S12	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S13	The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P41_S14	Significant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing PEGylation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	There are several competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in development.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	For Amikacin Inhale, the current standard of care includes several approved intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	For naloxegol, there are currently several alternative therapies used to address opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD), including subcutaneous Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) and oral and rectal over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, there are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Cubist Pharmaceuticals , Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	For etirinotecan pegol, there are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for breast and ovarian cancers including but not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Afinitor (everolimus), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Iniparib, Paraplatin (carboplatin), Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include, but are not limited to, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Eli Lilly Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Inc.and Sanofi Aventis.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	There are approved therapies for the treatment of colorectal cancer, including Eloxatin (oxaliplatin), Camptosar (irinotecan), Avastin (bevacizumab), Zaltrap (Ziv-afilbercept), Stivarga (regorafenib), Erbitux (cetuximab), Vectibix (panitumumab), Xeloda (capecitabine), Adrucil (fluorouracil) and Wellcovorin (leucovorin).
906709_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, there are a number of drugs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development from companies exploring cancer therapies or improved chemotherapeutic agents to potentially treat colorectal cancer, including, but not limited to, products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Antigenics, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm Inc., Meditech Research Ltd, Alchemia Limited, and Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P48_S3	As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P48_S4	These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P48_S5	If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Our decision to bear a majority or all of the clinical development costs of etirinotecan pegol substantially increases our future capital requirements.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S7	We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S9	The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S10	The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S11	We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S12	Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S13	We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S14	Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S15	We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, research, regulatory and finance, and may need to attract and retain marketing and distribution experts and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S16	We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S17	Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S18	Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S19	Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S20	Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S21	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S22	If earthquakes or other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S23	Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P50_S24	In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, political instability, or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply materials for drug candidates in development and our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Our collaborative partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P51_S5	We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Further, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S2	These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market prices.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S3	We also have a change of control severance benefit plan which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S4	This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S5	The price of our common stock is expected to remain volatile.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2012, based on closing bid prices on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our stock price ranged from $10.83 to $5.68 per share.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P52_S7	We expect our stock price to remain volatile.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The indenture governing the senior secured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The indenture governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to take various actions, such as:
906709_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	consummate a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination, or sell, assign, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, the indenture governing the senior secured notes contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring us to maintain a $25.0 million segregated cash reserve account until July 1, 2015 to be applied to interest payments on the notes in the event of a default, subject to certain conditions.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	This indenture also requires us not to permit, thereafter and through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, the aggregate balance of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Our ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Our failure to comply with our debt-related obligations could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness and the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes.
906709_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The restrictions contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.
906709_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	California We lease a 102,283 square foot facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility), under an operating lease which expires in 2020.
906709_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	In November 2010, we moved into the Mission Bay Facility relocating all of our functions from the San Carlos, California facility (San Carlos Facility), including our corporate headquarters and research and development for our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology operations.
906709_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	In December 2011, we expanded our lease of the Mission Bay Facility to include an additional 24,002 square feet of space.
906709_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	However, we retain the right to terminate the lease expansion on May 31, 2013.
906709_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	If we do not exercise the early termination right, the lease for the expanded space will expire in 2020, on the same date as the original lease agreement for the Mission Bay Facility.
906709_13_ITEM2_P0_S5	Our lease for approximately 100,000 square feet of the San Carlos Facility is under a capital lease which expires in 2016.
906709_13_ITEM2_P0_S6	We have subleased portions of the San Carlos Facility and are currently seeking one or more subtenants for the remaining space.
906709_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	Alabama We currently own three facilities consisting of approximately 160,000 square feet in Huntsville, Alabama, which house laboratories as well as administrative, clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities for our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology operations as well as manufacturing of APIs for early clinical studies.
906709_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	In July 2012, we consolidated our U.S.-based research activities into our Mission Bay Facility and ceased use of one of our buildings located in Huntsville that was dedicated to research activities.
906709_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are currently seeking a buyer for the land and building.
906709_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	India We own a research and development facility consisting of approximately 88,000 square feet, near Hyderabad, India.
906709_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease approximately 504 square feet of office space in Hyderabad, India, under a one-year operating lease that will expire in 2013.
906709_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	On November 18, 2009, the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) filed an action against Nektar in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
906709_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	SUNY seeks to recover amounts it alleges it is owed pursuant to a technology licensing contract between Nektar and SUNY.
906709_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	Discovery in the matter has closed and cross motions for summary judgment (including Nektar s motion for summary judgment dismissing the action) were filed in October 2012.
906709_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	The motions are fully briefed and are currently being considered by the court.
906709_13_ITEM3_P2_S2	In the event the action survives Nektar s motion, we expect that a trial would be scheduled in the first half of 2013.
906709_13_ITEM3_P2_S3	We believe that SUNY s claims are without merit.
906709_13_ITEM3_P2_S4	No reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can be made at this time and no liabilities have been recorded for this matter on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
906709_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NKTR.
906709_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The table below sets forth the high and low closing sales prices for our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the periods indicated.
906709_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	Holders of Record As of February 21, 2013, there were approximately 229 holders of record of our common stock.
906709_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock.

906709_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected consolidated financial data set forth below should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the other information contained herein.
906709_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on net sales of UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA .
906709_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests starting in the second quarter of 2012, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	(2) Operating costs and expenses includes the Gain on sale of pulmonary assets of $69.6 million in 2008.
906709_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	(3) Basic and diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
906709_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_13_ITEM6_P5_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_13_ITEM6_P5_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_13_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, and immunology.
906709_13_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other biologic drug candidates.
906709_13_ITEM7_P0_S3	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule when it is bonded with polymers.
906709_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our most advanced proprietary product candidate, naloxegol (formerly known as NKTR-118), is a peripheral opioid antagonist which has completed Phase 3 clinical studies for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC).
906709_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	We are a party to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with AstraZeneca for the global development and commercialization of naloxegol and naloxegol fixed-dose combination products (formerly known as NKTR-119).
906709_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The core Phase 3 clinical development program for naloxegol, which AstraZeneca calls the KODIAC program, is comprised of four clinical trials which are designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of naloxegol for the treatment of OIC in patients with non-cancer related pain.
906709_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	The outcome and timing of the naloxegol development program will have a substantial impact on our financial condition as we are entitled to up to $95 million in regulatory filing milestones and $140 million in commercial launch milestones.
906709_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	On November 12, 2012, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results from two Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trials and from a safety extension trial (KODIAC-04, -05, and -07).
906709_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	On February 26, 2013, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results from the long-term safety study (KODIAC-08) of naloxegol in patients with OIC.
906709_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	AstraZeneca has stated that it plans to submit an NDA filing in the U.S. and a marketing authorization application (MAA) filing in the E.U. in the third quarter of 2013, pending AstraZeneca s final preparation of the registration package and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
906709_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	In the event regulatory approval filings are submitted by AstraZeneca and accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), we would be entitled to receive $95.0 million in milestone payments.
906709_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	result, the outcome of AstraZeneca s determination to make regulatory filings for naloxegol with the FDA and EMA is critical to our financial position in 2013 as well as our future business prospects as a result of the significant economic stake that we have in success of the potential commercialization of naloxegol.
906709_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Our second most advanced proprietary drug candidate, etirinotecan pegol (formerly known as NKTR-102), is a next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor.
906709_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	Etirinotecan pegol is currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), is scheduled to enroll approximately 840 patients with metastatic breast cancer that have previously received treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	The BEACON study will require a substantial investment over the next two years.
906709_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	In November 2012, etirinotecan pegol was designated by the FDA as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer progressing after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We have completed an expanded Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
906709_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	We are currently in the process of finalizing the data in furtherance of planned meetings with health authorities in 2013 which will guide our future development and regulatory strategy for etirinotecan pegol in ovarian cancer.
906709_13_ITEM7_P8_S3	In addition, a Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is still open for enrollment.
906709_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	We have a significant collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, that has completed Phase 2 clinical development.
906709_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and Amikacin Inhale and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer in August 2007 to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	The stability studies on the nebulizer device that needed to be completed prior to the start of the Phase 3 clinical study were successfully completed in February 2013.
906709_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	The Phase 3 clinical program is expected to be initiated by Bayer in March 2013.
906709_13_ITEM7_P9_S4	In 2011, Bayer achieved agreement with the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 3 clinical studies of BAY41-6551 under the Special Protocol Assessment process that is intended to support the submission of a NDA if the planned Phase 3 clinical study is successful.
906709_13_ITEM7_P9_S5	We also have a significant collaboration with Baxter Healthcare to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_13_ITEM7_P9_S6	Under the terms of this collaboration, we are providing a license to our intellectual property and our PEGylation technology and expertise.
906709_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	Baxter is responsible for all clinical development.
906709_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	The first drug candidate in this collaboration, BAX 855, is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein which has completed Phase 1 clinical development in patients with hemophilia A.
906709_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	In February 2013, Baxter initiated a Phase 3 multi-center, open-label clinical study called PROLONG-ATE that will enroll more than 100 previously treated adult patients with severe hemophilia A to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BAX 855 for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding.
906709_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	If BAX 855 is approved by health authorities and is successfully commercialized by Baxter, this would represent a substantial royalty revenue opportunity for us, subject to significant risks and uncertainties relating to regulatory approval with health authorities and subsequent commercial success.
906709_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	While the late stage clinical development programs described above are key elements of the future success of our company, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier-stage drug candidate pipeline.
906709_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	For example, in April 2012 we advanced NKTR-192, our short-acting opioid drug candidate, into Phase 1 clinical studies and in July 2012 we advanced NKTR-181 into a Phase 2 clinical study and plan to conduct a human abuse liability study for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2013.
906709_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial prospects, financial condition, and market value.
906709_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary PEGylation reagents on a cost-plus or fixed price basis.
906709_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply PEGylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	As a result, whenever possible, we are renegotiating or not seeking renewal of legacy manufacturing supply arrangements that do not include a strategic development or commercialization component.
906709_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	For example, in October 2010, we entered into a supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement with Amgen, Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited, which has significantly amended economic and other terms in the non-exclusive supply and license agreement we previously entered into with Amgen in 1995.
906709_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	In addition, in December 2010, we entered into an amended manufacturing and supply agreement with Merck (through its acquisition of Schering-Plough Corporation) to provide for transfer to an alternative manufacturer and revised economics for an interim supply arrangement until that transition is completed.
906709_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $302.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities and $149.0 million in indebtedness.
906709_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017 which we issued during the three months ended September 30, 2012, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement with RPI Finance Trust (RPI).
906709_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	As is further described in Note 7, this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash, but we may be required to make a payment of up to $7.0 million in 2014 if the worldwide net sales thresholds of MIRCERA in 2013 are not met.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	During the year-ended December 31, 2012, we retired $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our previously outstanding convertible subordinated notes.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including etirinotecan pegol, Amikacin Inhale, NKTR-181, and NKTR-192 will require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	However, we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	In addition, while in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration agreements and other significant transactions, we do not currently anticipate completing new transactions with substantial upfront payments in the near -term.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	Our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S6	The availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on the success or failure of our drug development programs including naloxegol, etirinotecan pegol, BAX 855, Amikacin Inhale, NKTR-181, and NKTR-192.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S7	The availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations all depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies, whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining health authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S8	In particular, we are entitled to up to $235.0 million of regulatory and commercial launch milestones under our license agreement with AstraZeneca, $95.0 million of which is related to AstraZeneca submitting regulatory approval filings for naloxegol with the FDA and with the EMA.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S9	AstraZeneca has indicated that it plans to submit regulatory filings for naloxegol subject to subject to AstraZeneca s final preparation of the registration package and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
906709_13_ITEM7_P17_S10	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant up-front payments or do not receive the naloxegol regulatory milestone payments in 2013, we would likely be required to pursue financing alternatives.
906709_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	In the event we determine to explore financing alternatives, our objective would be to first pursue financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders.
906709_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	However, if non-dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we could be required to pursue dilutive equity-based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock.
906709_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, license fees, milestone payments or contract research payments.
906709_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	The amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations, such as manufacturing and supply commitments, are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue.
906709_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations.
906709_13_ITEM7_P19_S5	Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by us to determine the performance periods.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Product sales Product sales include fixed price and cost-plus manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Product sales increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 as a result of increased product demand from a number of our collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Product sales decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due in part to the transfer of manufacturing activities to certain collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	The timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	We expect product sales to increase in 2013 as compared to 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S6	Royalty revenues decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of the sale of the royalties we receive from UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA product sales as is further described below.
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S7	Royalty revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of the increase in royalties received from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_13_ITEM7_P20_S8	We expect royalties to decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $8.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively, in aggregate royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA effective for all periods from January 1, 2012 through the life of the royalty obligation.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized $13.5 million in aggregate royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , of which the $2.7 million recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2012 was retained by us as these amounts resulted from product sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the $10.8 million recognized in the nine months ended December 31, 2012 was remitted directly to the purchaser as these amounts resulted from product sales in the first three quarters of 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	We expect non cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA to increase in 2013 as compared to 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S6	License, collaboration and other revenue License, collaboration and other revenue includes amortization of upfront payments and milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S7	The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments, the achievement of milestones, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of reimbursed research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S8	License, collaboration and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the recognition in 2011 of a $5.0 million license fee from an agreement signed in September 2011.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S9	This decrease was partially offset by the recognition of the $5.0 million license fee noted above, $6.0 million in milestones earned under existing collaboration agreements, and increases in revenue recognized in 2011 from upfront payments received by us during 2010.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S10	We expect license, collaboration and other revenue in 2013 to increase as compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the recognition of milestones under existing collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S11	In the event regulatory approval filings for naloxegol are submitted by AstraZeneca and accepted by the FDA and by the EMA, we would be entitled to $95.0 million in milestone payments.
906709_13_ITEM7_P21_S12	If these filings occur in 2013, our license, collaboration and other revenue in 2013 will increase significantly from 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Revenue by geography Revenue by geographic area is based on locations of our partners.
906709_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands): The increase in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to increased product sales and royalty revenues from our existing European collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM7_P23_S2	The decrease in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to the revenue we recognized in 2010 from the AstraZeneca license agreement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Cost of goods sold increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the $10.5 million increase in product sales in 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	The increase in product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to the decreased cost per unit in 2012 resulting from increased manufacturing activity, resulting in improved overhead absorption.
906709_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	The decrease in cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the $2.5 million decrease in product sales in 2011 and an increase in overall commercial and proprietary manufacturing activity in 2011 compared to 2010 that resulted in decreased costs per unit.
906709_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	The increase in product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the different mix of products sold and the decreased costs per unit in 2011 resulting from increased manufacturing activity.
906709_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	We expect product gross margin to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level and mix of manufacturing orders from our customers due to the fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities.
906709_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation), clinical study costs, direct costs of outside research conducted by clinical research organizations, materials, supplies, licenses and fees.
906709_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	The increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the $15.2 million increase in direct research and development program costs, a substantial portion of which is attributable to the etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) Phase 3 BEACON clinical study initiated in December 2011 as well as the NKTR-181 Phase 2 clinical study initiated in July 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	In addition, research and development expense increased due to a $6.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits resulting from increased headcount to support our expanded clinical development activities.
906709_13_ITEM7_P25_S4	The increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to a $7.5 million increase in direct research and development program and materials costs, a $3.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, and a $6.3 million increase in support and facilities-related costs, which includes increased non-cash depreciation and non-cash rent expenses related to the move to our facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility) at the end of 2010.
906709_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The following table shows expenses incurred for preclinical study support, clinical supplies, clinical and regulatory services provided by third parties and direct materials costs for each of our drug candidates.
906709_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	(1) Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1.
906709_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we made $11.2 million of prepayments to certain vendors in our BEACON study.
906709_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	(3) We partnered this program with Bayer Healthcare LLC in August 2007.
906709_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale in 2008, we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate.
906709_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	(4) We partnered this program with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) in 2009.
906709_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	In general, all development costs incurred by us after partnering with AstraZeneca are reimbursed by AstraZeneca.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	We expect research and development expense to increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 and to continue at or above the 2012 level for the next several years.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	We plan to continue to advance etirinotecan pegol in the Phase 3 BEACON study for metastatic breast cancer for which we expect patient enrollment to continue throughout 2013 and the clinical study to continue through 2014.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S2	We are also finishing data analysis from the expanded Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in patients with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer in preparation for meetings with health authorities in 2013.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S3	At the same time, we continue to advance the Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in colorectal cancer patients.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S4	Our current plan is to fund all of the clinical development costs for etirinotecan pegol for the foreseeable future without reimbursement from a collaboration partner.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S5	The clinical development costs for the BEACON clinical study will continue to be significant.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S6	We estimate that the total third party and direct material costs over the life of the BEACON study will range from approximately $110.0 million to $120.0 million, of which $26.0 million was incurred through the end of 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S7	We are unable to estimate the timing or costs to complete the clinical development for etirinotecan pegol across all the potential oncology indications.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S8	In addition to our etirinotecan pegol development activities, in 2013, we plan to continue to enroll the ongoing Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-181 and also initiate and complete a human abuse liability study for NKTR-181.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S9	Further, if the Phase 2 clinical results are successful, we plan to begin preparations for the commencement of Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S10	We also plan to continue to advance the development of NKTR-192.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S11	We are also actively advancing the preclinical development work for NKTR-171 and NKTR-214 in preparation for entering clinical development in the 2013-2014 timeframe.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S12	In addition, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale-up for the nebulizer devices to supply Bayer for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S13	Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer, we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for this drug candidate.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S14	We do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with naloxegol or the naloxegol fixed-dose combination products as AstraZeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S15	In addition to our drug candidates that we plan to have in clinical development during 2013 and beyond, we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build the value of our drug candidate pipeline and our business.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S16	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our pegylation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S17	We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_13_ITEM7_P32_S18	Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
906709_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	In order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development, each drug candidate must be tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies.
906709_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete.
906709_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
906709_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.
906709_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Furthermore, our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for naloxegol and Amikacin Inhale.
906709_13_ITEM7_P34_S2	In these situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control.
906709_13_ITEM7_P34_S3	We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P34_S4	The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	General and administrative expense includes the cost of administrative staffing, business development, marketing, finance, human resources and legal activities.
906709_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	General and administrative expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of a $2.7 million payment obligation incurred in 2011 related to the settlement of a commercial litigation matter as well as a $2.1 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense in 2012 as compared to 2011.
906709_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, general and administrative expense increased by $2.7 million due to the payment obligation related to the settlement of a commercial litigation matter noted above.
906709_13_ITEM7_P36_S3	In addition, general and administrative expense increased due to personnel-related costs, support and facilities-related costs, and other administrative costs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P36_S4	In 2013, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase modestly compared to 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	In an effort to reduce ongoing operating costs and improve our organizational structure, efficiency and productivity, in March 2012, we announced a plan to consolidate our U.S.-based research activities at our existing San Francisco location and to cease the use of and offer for sale one of our buildings located in Huntsville, Alabama that was dedicated to research activities.
906709_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	As a result, we concluded that the combined carrying value of the land and building exceeded fair value and we recorded an impairment loss of $1.7 million in March 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	No further impairment losses were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2012, however, until we dispose of these assets, we will update our analysis of their fair value on a regular basis and such updates could result in further impairment charges in future periods.
906709_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	As of December 31, 2012, the remaining net book value of these assets is $2.8 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we relocated all of our operations previously located in San Carlos, California, including our corporate headquarters, to our Mission Bay Facility in San Francisco, California.
906709_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	We determined that the carrying value of the San Carlos facility exceeded its fair value based on a discounted cash flow model and an impairment charge of $12.6 million was recognized as a result.
906709_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the remaining net book value of these assets is $1.4 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2011.
906709_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is a result of higher average cash and investment balances partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is attributable to the interest expense recorded on the senior secured notes we issued in 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million of 12% senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2017.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	In connection with this transaction, we retired a principal amount of $42.5 million of our $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible subordinated notes in exchange for $42.5 million in principal amount of 12% senior secured notes.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	We repaid the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in full at maturity on September 28, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	The increase in non-cash interest expense on liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is attributable to the royalty sale transaction that we completed in 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	We impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate, which we currently estimated to be approximately 17%.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the estimated interest rate and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis.
906709_13_ITEM7_P40_S9	As a result, future interest rates could differ significantly and any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively.
906709_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	As a result of the timing of the royalty sale transaction and the issuance of the senior secured notes in 2012, we expect interest expense and non-cash interest expense to increase in 2013 as compared to 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 30, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily attributable to the complete amortization of deferred financing costs during 2010 relating to our 3.25% convertible subordinated notes that matured in September 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and research and development contracts, as well as public and private placements of debt and equity.
906709_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of $302.2 million and indebtedness of $149.0 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P41_S4	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties.
906709_13_ITEM7_P41_S5	As is further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash, but we may be required to make a payment of up to $7.0 million in 2014 if the worldwide net sales thresholds of MIRCERA in 2013 are not met.
906709_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes.
906709_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	In connection with this transaction, we retired a principal amount of $42.5 million of our $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible subordinated notes in exchange for $42.5 million in principal amount of senior secured notes.
906709_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	As a result of these transactions, we received cash of $82.5 million, less approximately $4.5 million in transaction costs, of which $25.0 million is required to be maintained in a restricted account until July 1, 2015.
906709_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	On September 28, 2012, we repaid the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount on the convertible subordinated notes.
906709_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	Additionally at December 31, 2012, we had letter of credit arrangements with certain financial institutions and vendors, including our landlord, totaling $2.4 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P42_S5	These letters of credit will expire during 2013 and are secured by investments of similar amounts.
906709_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	We have no material credit facility or other material committed sources of capital.
906709_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans.
906709_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102), Amikacin Inhale, NKTR-181, and NKTR-192 will require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_13_ITEM7_P43_S3	However, we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	, we do not currently anticipate completing new transactions with substantial upfront payments in the near -term.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	Our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S2	The availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on the success or failure of our drug development programs including naloxegol, BAX 855, Amikacin Inhale, etirinotecan pegol, NKTR-181, and NKTR-192.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S3	The availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations all depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies, whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining health authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S4	In particular, we are entitled to up to $235.0 million of regulatory and commercial launch milestones under our license agreement with AstraZeneca, $95.0 million of which is related to AstraZeneca submitting regulatory approval filings for naloxegol with the FDA and with the EMA.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S5	AstraZeneca has indicated that it plans to submit regulatory filings for naloxegol subject to AstraZeneca s preparation of the NDA submission package and a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S6	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant up-front payments or do not receive the naloxegol regulatory milestone payments in 2013, we would likely be required to pursue financing alternatives.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S7	In the event we determine to explore financing alternatives, our objective would be to first pursue financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders.
906709_13_ITEM7_P44_S8	However, if non-dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we could be required to pursue dilutive equity-based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock.
906709_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2013 and thereafter, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	These investments are generally held to maturity, which is less than two years.
906709_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	At December 31, 2012, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately four months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed two years.
906709_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but if such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_13_ITEM7_P45_S5	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $129.8 million, which includes $148.3 million of net operating cash uses, partially offset by the receipt of $18.5 million from collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	Net operating cash uses also include $6.7 million in interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes retired in full on September 28, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront and milestone payments received, if any, will increase in 2013 as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs, in particular, our BEACON study.
906709_13_ITEM7_P46_S3	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $113.7 million, which includes $7.0 million for semi-annual interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes, $11.2 million of prepayments to certain vendors in our BEACON study, and $125.0 million of other net operating cash uses, partially offset by the receipt of $29.5 million from collaboration agreements, of which $16.5 million was included in accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 resulting from an upfront payment obligation arising from an amendment to one of our manufacturing and supply agreements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	on our convertible subordinated notes, and was partially offset by a $50.0 million upfront payment received from Amgen under the supply, dedicated suite and manufacturing guarantee agreement that we entered into with Amgen in October 2010.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Cash flows from investing activities We purchased $10.6 million, $9.7 million, and $31.5 million of property and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Our capital expenditures were higher in 2010 as we constructed the leasehold improvements for the Mission Bay Facility and completed our research and development facility in Hyderabad, India.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	We expect our capital expenditures in 2013 to be consistent with 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S4	Cash flows used in financing activities On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S5	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S6	On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million of senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2017.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S7	As part of this transaction, we incurred approximately $4.5 million in issuance costs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S8	In connection with this transaction, we retired the principal amount of $42.5 million of our $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in exchange for $42.5 million in principal amount of the senior secured notes.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S9	In addition, $25.0 million of the proceeds from the senior secured notes issuance is required to be maintained in a restricted account until July 1, 2015.
906709_13_ITEM7_P47_S10	On September 28, 2012, we repaid the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes.
906709_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	On January 24, 2011, we completed a public offering of our common stock with gross proceeds of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P48_S1	As part of the public offering, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_13_ITEM7_P48_S2	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $4.1 million, $4.5 million, and $8.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
906709_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	(1) The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 8 of Item 8.
906709_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	In November 2010, we moved into our Mission Bay Facility, which includes our corporate headquarters and a research and development center.
906709_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	September 30, 2009 for the Mission Bay Facility, we will begin making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014.
906709_13_ITEM7_P51_S1	On December 28, 2011, we amended the sublease of the Mission Bay Facility to include an additional 24,002 square feet of space.
906709_13_ITEM7_P51_S2	Under the terms of the amendment, beginning January 1, 2012, we began making lease payments for this additional space of $40,000 per month until at least May 31, 2013.
906709_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	The sublease is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	(3) These amounts primarily result from capital lease obligations arising from our office space lease at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California.
906709_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	In November 2010, we ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of all of our California functions to our Mission Bay Facility.
906709_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	We have subleased a portion of the San Carlos Facility and are currently seeking one or more subtenants for the remaining space.
906709_13_ITEM7_P52_S3	This is further discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	(4) Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2012 that were issued under existing contracts.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S1	This amount does not represent any minimum contract termination liabilities for our existing contracts.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S2	Given our current cash requirements, we forecast that we will have sufficient cash to meet our net operating expense requirements and contractual obligations at least through December 31, 2013.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S3	We plan to continue to invest in the advancement of our research and development drug candidate pipeline and our future cash requirements will depend upon the timing and results of these investments.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S4	Our capital needs will depend on many factors, including continued progress in our research and development programs, progress with preclinical and clinical trials of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates, our ability to successfully enter into additional collaboration agreements for one or more of our proprietary drug candidates or intellectual property that we control, the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals, the costs of developing and scaling our clinical and commercial manufacturing operations, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims, the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S5	Our substantial debt, the market price of our securities, and the general economic climate, among other factors, could have material consequences for our financial condition and could affect our sources of short-term and long-term funding.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S6	Our ability to meet our ongoing operating expenses and repay our outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon our and our partners ability to successfully complete clinical development of, obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize new drugs.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S7	Even if we or our partners are successful, we may require additional capital to continue to fund our operations and repay our debt obligations as they become due.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S8	There can be no assurance that additional funds, if and when required, will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
906709_13_ITEM7_P53_S9	We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.
906709_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_13_ITEM7_P54_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
906709_13_ITEM7_P54_S2	Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
906709_13_ITEM7_P54_S3	We have determined that for the periods reported in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of our operations.
906709_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Revenue Recognition License, collaboration and other research revenue is recognized based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes amortization of upfront fees.
906709_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	We defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed.
906709_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	Upfront fees are recognized ratably over the expected performance period under each arrangement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, clinical development activities, or manufacturing activities through the completion of clinical development or the termination or expiration of the collaboration agreement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	Given the complexities and uncertainties of collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required by management to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had $25.8 million of deferred upfront fees related to two collaboration agreements that are being amortized over 11 to 14 years, or an average of 12.5 years.
906709_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	For our collaboration agreements, our performance obligations may span the life of the agreement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P59_S1	For these, the shortest reasonable period is the end of the development period (estimated to be 4 to 6 years) and the longest period is the contractual life of the agreement, which is generally 10-12 years from the first commercial sale.
906709_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Given the statistical probability of drug development success in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, drug development programs have only a 5% to 10% probability of reaching commercial success.
906709_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	If we had determined a longer or shorter amortization period was appropriate, our annual upfront fee amortization for these agreements could be as low as $2.4 million or as high as $11.0 million as compared to the $3.2 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7_P61_S1	As of December 31, 2012, we also had $90.4 million of deferred upfront fees related to seven license, manufacturing and supply agreements that are being amortized over periods from 5 to 10 years.
906709_13_ITEM7_P61_S2	Our performance obligations for these agreements may include technology transfer assistance and/or back-up manufacturing and supply services for a specified period of time; therefore, the time estimated to complete the performance obligations related to licenses is either specified or is much shorter than the collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P61_S3	We may experience delays in the execution of technology transfer plans, which may result in a longer amortization period for applicable agreements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P61_S4	Our original estimates are periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimates to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	On January 1, 2011, we adopted on a prospective basis Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, which amends the criteria to identify separate units of accounting within Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2012, we entered into our first arrangement that requires accounting under this guidance.
906709_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	Under this guidance, at the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_13_ITEM7_P62_S3	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_13_ITEM7_P62_S4	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P62_S5	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical study activities performed by third parties.
906709_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_13_ITEM7_P64_S1	If the actual timing of these phases varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual prospectively.
906709_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical studies based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably based on patient enrollment in the studies.
906709_13_ITEM7_P65_S1	In addition, certain time-based costs are expensed ratably over the treatment phase.
906709_13_ITEM7_P65_S2	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model for each respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	We expense the estimated fair value of each award, as adjusted by the estimated historical forfeiture rate, ratably over the expected service period of the award.
906709_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan.
906709_13_ITEM7_P67_S2	In addition, management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_13_ITEM7_P67_S3	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.
906709_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	In addition, for awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P69_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments from sales of the CIMZIA and MIRCERA drug products marketed by UCB and Roche, respectively.
906709_13_ITEM7_P69_S1	Although we are required to make payments to the purchaser only in certain situations, including the event of our breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in the Purchase and Sale Agreement that gives rise to a liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement, this royalty sale transaction was recorded as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that we will amortize using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_13_ITEM7_P69_S2	As a result, we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the estimated interest rate.
906709_13_ITEM7_P69_S3	Our estimate of the interest rate under the agreement is based on the amount of royalty payments to be received by RPI over the life of the arrangement and payments we may be required to make to RPI under the agreement, if any.
906709_13_ITEM7_P69_S4	We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche using a combination of historical results and forecasts from market data sources.
906709_13_ITEM7_P69_S5	To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_13_ITEM7_P70_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_13_ITEM7_P70_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_13_ITEM7_P70_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are higher than expected, non-cash royalty revenues and non-cash interest expense would also be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_13_ITEM7_P71_S0	current estimate of 17%, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2012 would have increased by $1.2 million.
906709_13_ITEM7_P72_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2012, we were required to adopt new accounting guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income that prohibits the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the statement of stockholders equity and instead, provides the option of presenting OCI in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate consecutive statements.
906709_13_ITEM7_P72_S1	We elected to present OCI in two separate consecutive statements.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $0.4 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P0_S5	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $1.7 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2011.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2013, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	These investments are generally held to maturity, which is less than two years.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we held $252.8 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of four months.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we currently do not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P2_S4	Accordingly, we believe there are no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities and have not recorded any provisions for impairment.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.
906709_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P0_S1	Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2).
906709_13_ITEM8_P0_S2	These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company s management.
906709_13_ITEM8_P0_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
906709_13_ITEM8_P0_S4	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_13_ITEM8_P0_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_13_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nektar Therapeutics at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_13_ITEM8_P1_S4	Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
906709_13_ITEM8_P1_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
906709_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Nektar Therapeutics management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
906709_13_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
906709_13_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_13_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
906709_13_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
906709_13_ITEM8_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_13_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Nektar Therapeutics maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.
906709_13_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Nektar Therapeutics and our report dated February 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	NEKTAR THERAPEUTICS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2012 Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Francisco, California and incorporated in Delaware.
906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S1	We are developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms with the objective to improve the benefits of drugs for patients.
906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our research and development activities have required significant resources to date and are expected to continue to require significant resources.
906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future.
906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S4	We have financed our operations primarily through cash from licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreements as well as financing transactions.
906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S5	At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $302.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities, of which $25.0 million was restricted, and $149.0 million in indebtedness.
906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S6	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017 which we issued during the year ended December 31, 2012, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties.
906709_13_ITEM8_P9_S7	As is further described in Note 7, this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash, but we may be required to make a payment of up to $7.0 million to the royalty purchaser in 2014 if certain worldwide net sales thresholds of MIRCERA in 2013 are not met.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we retired $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of all of our previously outstanding convertible subordinated notes.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Nektar Therapeutics (India) Private Limited, Nektar Therapeutics UK, Ltd. (Nektar UK) and Aerogen, Inc.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S2	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S3	In December 2010, we completed the dissolution of Aerogen, Inc. and all remaining assets were transferred to Nektar Therapeutics.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S4	Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S5	Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S6	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S7	To date, such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position.
906709_13_ITEM8_P10_S8	Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recorded in operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 were not material.
906709_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
906709_13_ITEM8_P11_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to deferred revenue recognition periods, inventories, the impairment of investments, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, contingencies, estimated interest expense from our liability related to our sale of future royalties, stock-based compensation, and ongoing litigation, amongst other estimates.
906709_13_ITEM8_P11_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
906709_13_ITEM8_P11_S4	These estimates also form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily apparent from other sources.
906709_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	Reclassifications Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P12_S1	Such reclassifications do not impact previously reported total revenue, operating loss or net loss or total assets, liabilities or stockholders equity.
906709_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	We consider all investments in marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
906709_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Investments in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year, or where our intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations, are classified as short-term investments.
906709_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	Investments are designated as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
906709_13_ITEM8_P13_S3	The disclosed fair value related to our cash equivalents and investments is based primarily on the reported fair values in our period-end brokerage statements, which are based on market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers and generally represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data.
906709_13_ITEM8_P13_S4	We independently validate these fair values using available market quotes and other information.
906709_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale, as well as amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, are included in interest income.
906709_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are included in other income (expense).
906709_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Accounts Receivable and Significant Customer Concentrations Our customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are located in the U.S. and Europe.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	Our accounts receivable balance contains billed and unbilled trade receivables from product sales and royalties, as well as time and materials based billings from collaborative research and development agreements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	When appropriate, we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S3	We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S4	We perform a regular review of our customers payment histories and associated credit risk.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S5	We have not experienced significant credit losses from our accounts receivable.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S6	At December 31, 2012, four different customers represented 38%, 27%, 14% and 11%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S7	At December 31, 2011, four different customers represented 26%, 20%, 19% and 17%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S8	Inventory and Significant Supplier Concentrations Inventory is generally manufactured upon receipt of firm purchase orders from our collaboration partners.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S9	Inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead and cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S10	Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and is net of reserves determined using specific identification plus an estimated reserve for defective or excess inventory based on historical experience or projected usage.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S11	Inventory related to research and development activities are expensed when purchased.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S12	We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide raw materials, drugs and devices of appropriate quality and reliability and to meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S13	In certain cases, we rely on single sources of supply of one or more critical materials.
906709_13_ITEM8_P16_S14	Consequently, in the event that supplies are delayed or interrupted for any reason, our ability to develop and produce our drug candidates or our ability to meet our supply obligations could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
906709_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
906709_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Manufacturing, laboratory and other equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over estimated useful lives of three to seven years.
906709_13_ITEM8_P17_S3	Leasehold improvements and buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
906709_13_ITEM8_P17_S4	We periodically review our property and equipment for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
906709_13_ITEM8_P17_S5	Generally, an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset (See Note 11).
906709_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for another entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
906709_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	We test for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year using an October 1 measurement date, as well as at other times when impairment indicators exist or when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
906709_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	We are organized in one reporting unit and have evaluated the goodwill for the Company as a whole.
906709_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	In order to test for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and, if so, we perform a two-step goodwill impairment test.
906709_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount.
906709_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be performed; otherwise, no.
906709_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	The second step compares the book value of our assigned goodwill to the implied fair value of our goodwill.
906709_13_ITEM8_P21_S3	We did not recognize any goodwill-related impairment charges during 2012, 2011, or 2010.
906709_13_ITEM8_P21_S4	We enter into arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaboration partners that may involve multiple deliverables.
906709_13_ITEM8_P21_S5	Our arrangements may contain one or more of the following elements: upfront fees, contract research and development, milestone payments, manufacturing and supply payments, royalties, and license fees.
906709_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Each deliverable in the arrangement is evaluated to determine whether it meets the criteria to be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting or whether it should be combined with other deliverables.
906709_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Revenue is recognized separately for each element.
906709_13_ITEM8_P22_S2	On January 1, 2011, we adopted on a prospective basis Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2009-13, which amends the criteria to identify separate units of accounting within Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P22_S3	Under this guidance, at the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate all consideration received under multiple-element arrangements to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_13_ITEM8_P22_S4	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_13_ITEM8_P22_S5	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P22_S6	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material change in our estimates would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	We have not experienced any significant returns from our customers.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	Generally, we are entitled to royalties from our partners based on the net sales of their approved drugs that are marketed and sold in one or more countries where we hold royalty rights.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S3	We recognize royalty revenue when the cash is received or when the royalty amount to be received is estimable and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S4	With respect to the non-cash royalties related to sale of future royalties described at Note 7, revenues are recognized during the period in which the related royalty report is received, which generally occurs in the quarter after the applicable product sales are made.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S5	License, collaboration and other Upfront fees received by us in license and collaboration arrangements that include future obligations, such as manufacturing and supply obligations, are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each respective arrangement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S6	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research activities, clinical development activities, and manufacturing activities from development through the commercialization of the product.
906709_13_ITEM8_P23_S7	Given the uncertainties of these collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	On January 1, 2011, we elected to prospectively adopt ASU 2010-17, Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition .
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	Under the milestone method, contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved, which we believe is consistent with the substance of our performance under our various license and collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	A milestone is defined as an event (i) that can only be achieved based in whole or in part either on the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due to the entity.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S3	A milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent with our performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance, relates solely to our past performance, and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S4	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners provide for payments to us upon the achievement of development milestones, such as the completion of clinical trials or regulatory submissions, approvals by health authorities, and commercial launches of drugs.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S5	Given the challenges inherent in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for drug products and in achieving commercial launches, there was substantial uncertainty whether any such milestones would be achieved at the time of execution of these licensing and collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S6	In addition, we evaluated whether the development milestones meet the remaining criteria to be considered substantive.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S7	As a result of our analysis, we consider our remaining development milestones under all of our license and collaboration agreements to be substantive and, accordingly, we expect to recognize as revenue future payments received from such milestones only if and as each milestone is achieved.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S8	Our license and collaboration agreements with certain partners also provide for contingent payments to us based solely upon the performance of the respective partner.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S9	For such contingent amounts we expect to recognize the payments as revenue when earned under the applicable contract, which is generally upon completion of performance by the respective partner, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S10	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners also provide for payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales volumes of approved drugs.
906709_13_ITEM8_P24_S11	We consider these payments to be similar to royalty payments and we will recognize such sales-based payments upon achievement of such sales volumes, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs We recognize costs related to shipping and handling of product to customers in cost of goods sold.
906709_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock option grants and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), in which employees may purchase our common stock at a discount to the market price.
906709_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of the option on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and the estimated fair value of common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination.
906709_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	We expense the value of the portion of the option or award that is ultimately expected to vest based on the historical forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	For awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP are recognized based on the estimated fair value of the common stock during each offering period and the percentage of the purchase discount.
906709_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	Expense amounts are allocated among inventory, cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense based on the function of the applicable employee.
906709_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Stock-based compensation charges are non-cash charges and as such have no impact on our reported cash flows.
906709_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Research and Development Expense Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits and other operating costs such as outside services, supplies and allocated overhead costs.
906709_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	We perform research and development for our proprietary drug candidates and technology development and for certain third parties under collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	For our proprietary drug candidates and our internal technology development programs, we invest our own funds without reimbursement from a third party.
906709_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical trial activities performed by third parties.
906709_13_ITEM8_P33_S3	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical trials ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_13_ITEM8_P33_S4	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical trials based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the trials.
906709_13_ITEM8_P33_S5	In addition, certain time-based costs are expensed ratably over the treatment phase.
906709_13_ITEM8_P33_S6	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
906709_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	available to common stockholders is equal to the reported net loss.
906709_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same due to our historical net losses and the requirement to exclude potentially dilutive securities which would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.
906709_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	The weighted average of these potentially dilutive securities has been excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation and is as follows (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method.
906709_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
906709_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
906709_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.
906709_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	We utilize a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions.
906709_13_ITEM8_P38_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
906709_13_ITEM8_P38_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Comprehensive loss Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.
906709_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Our other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net loss, gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of the assets and liabilities of our India and UK subsidiaries, and unrealized gains and losses on investments.
906709_13_ITEM8_P39_S2	Recent Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2012, we were required to adopt new accounting guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income that prohibits the presentation of other comprehensive income (OCI) in the statement of stockholders equity and instead, provides the option of presenting OCI in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate consecutive statements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P39_S3	We elected to present OCI in two separate consecutive statements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P39_S4	Note 2 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Available-For-Sale Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments are as follows (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Included in our restricted cash balance on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012 is $25.0 million of restricted cash required to be maintained until July 1, 2017 under the terms of our senior secured notes issued in July 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had letter of credit arrangements in favor of a landlord and certain vendors totaling $2.4 million.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	These letters of credit are secured by investments of similar amounts.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	Our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments includes (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S3	The following table summarizes our portfolio of available-for-sale investments reported as short-term and long-term investments by contractual maturity (in thousands): We invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S4	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S5	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in securities with maturities of two years or less and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S6	Gross unrealized gains and losses were not significant at December 31, 2012 and 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S7	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, we sold available-for-sale securities totaling $5.4 million, $210.1 million and $15.5 million, respectively, and realized gains and losses were not significant in any of those periods.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S8	All of our investments are categorized as Level 1 or Level 2, as explained in the table below.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S9	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
906709_13_ITEM8_P41_S10	The following table represents the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P42_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P42_S3	Note 3 Inventory Inventory consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	Note 4 Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	Building and leasehold improvements include our manufacturing, research and development and administrative facilities and the related improvements to these facilities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	Laboratory and manufacturing equipment include assets that support both our manufacturing and research and development efforts.
906709_13_ITEM8_P44_S2	Construction-in-progress includes assets being built to enhance our manufacturing and research and development efforts.
906709_13_ITEM8_P44_S3	Property and equipment includes certain assets acquired through capital leases (See Note 6).
906709_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	In July 2012, we consolidated our U.S.-based research activities into our existing San Francisco facility and ceased use of one of our buildings located in Huntsville, Alabama that was dedicated to research activities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P45_S1	The announcement of this consolidation plan in March 2012 triggered the recognition of a $1.7 million impairment charge relating to these assets (see Note 11).
906709_13_ITEM8_P45_S2	Depreciation expense, including depreciation of assets acquired through capital leases, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $13.8 million, $15.0 million, and $14.8 million, respectively.
906709_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	The outstanding balances of our senior secured notes and our convertible subordinated notes are as follows (in thousands): On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (Senior Notes) with the entire principal amount due on July 15, 2017.
906709_13_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Senior Notes bear interest at 12.0% per annum payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2013.
906709_13_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Senior Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets.
906709_13_ITEM8_P46_S3	In connection with this transaction, we retired $42.5 million of principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in exchange for the same principal amount of Senior Notes and received the remaining proceeds in cash, less approximately $4.5 million in transaction costs.
906709_13_ITEM8_P46_S4	Given that the Senior Notes were recently issued in July 2012, we believe the carrying amount of the Senior Notes is consistent with its fair value at December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Senior Notes contain customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, and make certain restricted payments, but do not contain covenants related to future financial performance.
906709_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	In particular, $25.0 million of the proceeds is required to be maintained in a restricted account until July 1, 2015 and which is included in restricted cash.
906709_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Senior Notes are callable by us at any time, subject to certain prepayment premiums and conditions.
906709_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	If we experience certain change of control events, the holders of the Senior Notes will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	In addition, upon certain asset sales, we may be required to offer to use the net proceeds thereof to purchase some of the Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	We used the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes and our existing cash to repay the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in full at maturity on September 28, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	We lease office space and certain office equipment under capital lease arrangements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The gross carrying value by major asset class and accumulated depreciation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	We lease office space at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California under capital lease arrangements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	Under the terms of the lease, rent increases up to 3% annually and the lease termination date is October 5, 2016.
906709_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	As of November 29, 2010, we ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of our San Carlos operations and corporate headquarters to San Francisco, California.
906709_13_ITEM8_P50_S3	We have subleased portions of the San Carlos facility and are currently seeking one or more subtenants for the remaining space, but have not been relieved of any obligations under the terms of this lease.
906709_13_ITEM8_P50_S4	As a result of our relocation, an impairment test was performed for the building and related leasehold improvements located in San Carlos.
906709_13_ITEM8_P50_S5	As a result of this impairment test, we recorded an impairment charge of $12.6 million in November 2010 (see Note 11).
906709_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Future minimum payments for our capital leases at December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands): Operating Lease On September 30, 2009, we entered into an operating sublease (Sublease) with Pfizer, Inc. for a 102,283 square foot facility located in San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility).
906709_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	Upon completion of construction of the Mission Bay Facility, we moved in on November 29, 2010.
906709_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Mission Bay Facility includes a research and development center with biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical development capabilities, as well as all of the functions previously located in San Carlos, California, including our corporate headquarters.
906709_13_ITEM8_P51_S3	Under the terms of the Sublease, we will begin making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014, after the expiration of our free rent period on August 1, 2014.
906709_13_ITEM8_P51_S4	The Sublease term is 114 months, commencing in August 2010 and terminating on January 31, 2020.
906709_13_ITEM8_P51_S5	Monthly base rent will start at $2.95 per square foot and will escalate over the term of the sublease at various intervals to $3.42 per square foot in the final period of the Sublease term.
906709_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Rent expense is being recognized ratably from April 2010, the inception of our tenant improvement construction period, through the end of the Sublease term.
906709_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	In addition, throughout the term of the Sublease, we are responsible for paying certain costs and expenses specified in the Sublease, including insurance costs and a pro rata share of operating expenses and applicable taxes for the Mission Bay Facility.
906709_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	On December 28, 2011, we amended the Sublease to include an additional 24,002 square feet of space.
906709_13_ITEM8_P52_S3	The amendment term commenced on December 28, 2011 and ends on January 31, 2020.
906709_13_ITEM8_P52_S4	However, we retain the right to terminate the amendment on or prior to May 31, 2013.
906709_13_ITEM8_P52_S5	Under the terms of the amendment, beginning January 1, 2012, we began making lease payments of $40,000 per month which will continue until the termination option expires.
906709_13_ITEM8_P52_S6	Our future minimum lease payments for our operating lease at December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
906709_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, rent expense for all our operating leases, including our Mission Bay Facility, was approximately $2.8 million, $2.4 million, and $2.2 million, respectively.
906709_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Note 7 Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties On February 24, 2012, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with RPI Finance Trust (RPI), an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, pursuant to which we sold, and RPI purchased, our right to receive royalty payments (the Royalty Entitlement) arising from the worldwide net sales, from and after January 1, 2012, of (a) CIMZIA , under Nektar s license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB), and (b) MIRCERA , under Nektar s license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together referred to as Roche).
906709_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	We received aggregate cash proceeds for the Royalty Entitlement of $124.0 million.
906709_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs, which will be amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P54_S3	As a result of our ongoing manufacturing and supply obligations related to the generation of these royalties, although we sold all of our rights to receive royalties from the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, we will continue to account for these royalties as revenue and recorded the $124.0 million in proceeds from this transaction as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that will be amortized using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P54_S4	The following table shows the activity within the liability account during the year ended December 31, 2012 (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to RPI which started in the second quarter of 2012 for royalties arising from product sales in the first quarter of 2012, we will continue to recognize revenue for these royalties.
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	We recognize royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA upon notification of the actual royalty amount, which occurs in the quarter after such sales are made.
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized $13.5 million in aggregate royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , of which the $2.7 million recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2012 was retained by us as these amounts resulted from royalties on product sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the $10.8 million recognized in the nine month period ended December 31, 2012 was remitted by UCB and Roche directly to RPI as these amounts resulted from product sales in the first three quarters of 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	As royalties are remitted to RPI from Roche and UCB, the balance of the Royalty Obligation will be effectively repaid over the life of the agreement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S4	In order to determine the amortization of the Royalty Obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by RPI and payments we are required to make to RPI as noted below, if any, over the life of the agreement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S5	The sum of these amounts less the $124.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S6	Since inception, our estimate of this total interest expense resulted in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 17%.
906709_13_ITEM8_P55_S7	We will periodically assess the estimated royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche and to the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates, or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P56_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are more than expected, the non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense recorded by us would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we are required to pay to RPI (a) $3.0 million if certain worldwide net sales thresholds of MIRCERA for the 12 month period ending on December 31, 2012 are not achieved and (b) up to an additional $7.0 million if certain worldwide net sales thresholds of MIRCERA for the 12 month period ending on December 31, 2013 are not achieved.
906709_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Purchase and Sale Agreement grants RPI the right to receive certain reports and other information relating to the Royalty Entitlement and contains other representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations that are customary for a transaction of this nature.
906709_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	In particular, if we breach our obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we could be required to pay damages to RPI that are not limited to the purchase price we received in the sale transaction.
906709_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we have concluded that it is probable that the minimum 2012 MIRCERA net sales threshold will not be met and, therefore, we expect to make the $3.0 million payment to RPI described above in the first quarter of 2013.
906709_13_ITEM8_P57_S4	The liability for this expected $3.0 million payment is included in other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	We have third party licenses that require us to pay royalties based on our shipment of certain products and/or on our receipt of royalty payments under certain of our collaboration agreements.
906709_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Royalty expense, which is reflected in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was approximately $2.9 million, $1.8 million, and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.
906709_13_ITEM8_P58_S2	The overall maximum amount of these obligations is based upon sales of the applicable products by our collaboration partners and cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Purchase Commitments In the normal course of business we enter into various firm purchase commitments related to contract manufacturing, clinical development and certain other items.
906709_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2012, these commitments were approximately $14.6 million, all of which are expected to be paid in 2013.
906709_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
906709_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
906709_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	Such provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
906709_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	If any unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or on our cash flows and liquidity.
906709_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	On November 18, 2009, the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) filed an action against Nektar in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
906709_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	SUNY seeks to recover amounts it alleges it is owed pursuant to a technology licensing contract between Nektar and SUNY.
906709_13_ITEM8_P63_S2	Discovery in the matter has closed and cross motions for summary judgment (including Nektar s motion for summary judgment dismissing the action) were filed in October 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P63_S3	The motions are fully briefed and are currently being considered by the court.
906709_13_ITEM8_P63_S4	In the event the action survives Nektar s motion, we expect that a trial would be scheduled in the first half of 2013.
906709_13_ITEM8_P63_S5	We believe that SUNY s claims are without merit.
906709_13_ITEM8_P63_S6	No reasonable estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can be made at this time and no liabilities have been recorded for this matter on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Indemnifications in Connection with Commercial Agreements As part of our collaboration agreements with our partners related to the license, development, manufacture and supply of drugs based on our proprietary technologies, we generally agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our partners from and against third party liabilities arising out of the agreement, including product liability (with respect to our activities) and infringement of intellectual property to the extent the intellectual property is developed by us and licensed to our partners.
906709_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	The term of these indemnification obligations is generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement.
906709_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	There is generally no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	As part of the sale of our royalty interest in the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, we and RPI made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by indemnity obligations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	Additionally, as part of our pulmonary asset sale to Novartis, we and Novartis made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by an indemnity obligation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	In the event it is determined that we breached certain of the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements made by us in any such agreements, we could incur substantial indemnification liabilities depending on the timing, nature, and amount of any such claims.
906709_13_ITEM8_P65_S3	To date we have not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification obligations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P65_S4	If any of our indemnification obligations is triggered, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Because the aggregate amount of any potential indemnification obligation is not a stated amount, the overall maximum amount of any such obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	No liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	Indemnification of Underwriters and Initial Purchasers of our Securities In connection with our sale of equity and senior secured debt securities, we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our underwriters or initial purchasers, as applicable, as well as certain related parties from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
906709_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	The term of these indemnification obligations is generally perpetual.
906709_13_ITEM8_P67_S2	There is no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P67_S3	We have never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification obligations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P67_S4	If any of our indemnification obligations are triggered, however, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Because the obligated amount of this agreement is not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Historically, we have not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Director and Officer Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, we indemnify our directors, executive officers, other officers, employees, and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity.
906709_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, we have insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
906709_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $500,000 per incident for securities related claims and $150,000 per incident for non-securities related claims retention deductible per our insurance policy.
906709_13_ITEM8_P69_S3	However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Because the obligated amount of this agreement is not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Historically, we have not been obligated to make significant payments for these obligations, and no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 or 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	We have authorized 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with each share having a par value of $0.0001.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S3	In 2011, 3,100,000 shares were previously designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) in connection with our Share Purchase Rights Plan (Rights Plan) that expired on June 1, 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S4	On March 30, 2012, we filed a certificate of elimination of the Series A Preferred Stock.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S5	As of December 31, 2012, no shares are designated, issued or outstanding.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S6	On January 24, 2011, we completed the issuance and sale of 19,000,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_13_ITEM8_P70_S7	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had 29,915,641 reserved shares of common stock, all of which are reserved for issuance in our equity compensation plans as summarized in the following table (share number in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	(1) Includes shares of common stock available for future issuance under our ESPP as of December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	Our 2012 Performance Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 4, 2012 and was approved by our stockholders on June 28, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	On the date of approval, any shares of the company s common stock that were available for issuance under all other previously existing stock plans (the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2000 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan) became available for issuance under the 2012 Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P73_S2	In addition, 5,300,000 new shares were made available for award grants under the 2012 Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P73_S3	No new awards were granted under any of the previous stock plans after June 28, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P73_S4	Any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the previous stock plans that expire, are cancelled, or otherwise terminate at any time after December 31, 2011 will also be available for award grant purposes under the 2012 Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	The purpose of the 2012 Plan and our other incentive plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward directors, officers, employees, and other eligible persons through the grant of awards and incentives for high levels of individual performance and increasing the value of our business, as well as to further align the interests of award recipients and our stockholders.
906709_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	The 2012 Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, stock bonuses, dividend equivalents, other similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the company s common stock or units of the company s common stock, as well as cash bonus awards.
906709_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	Directors, officers, or employees, and certain consultants and advisors may receive awards under the 2012 Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	In 2012, the requisite service period for stock options granted to our employees under the 2012 Plan as well as all other previously existing stock plans was generally four years; the requisite service period for stock options granted to our directors was generally one year.
906709_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2012 Plan is 10,347,140 shares, plus any shares subject to outstanding awards under the previous stock plans that expire, are cancelled, or otherwise terminate for any reason.
906709_13_ITEM8_P76_S2	Generally, shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason (except for shares exchanged by a participant or withheld to pay the exercise price of an award granted and related tax withholding obligations) are not paid or delivered under the 2012 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2012 Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P76_S3	Shares issued in respect of any award, other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, granted under the 2012 Plan will be counted against the plan s share limit as 1.5 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award.
906709_13_ITEM8_P76_S4	The 2012 Plan will terminate on April 3, 2022, unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors.
906709_13_ITEM8_P76_S5	The maximum term of a stock option or stock appreciation right under the 2012 Plan is eight years from the date of grant.
906709_13_ITEM8_P76_S6	The per share exercise price of an option generally may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the company s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.
906709_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	2008 Equity Incentive Plan Our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (2008 Plan) was adopted by the Board of Directors on March 20, 2008 and was approved by our stockholders on June 6, 2008.
906709_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	However, with the approval of the 2012 Plan, no new awards will be granted under the 2008 Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	Pursuant to the 2008 Plan, we granted or issued incentive stock options to employees and officers and non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock bonuses to consultants, employees, officers and non-employee directors.
906709_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	The 2008 Plan will terminate on March 20, 2018, unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors.
906709_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	The maximum term of a stock option under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan is eight years.
906709_13_ITEM8_P78_S3	The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2008 Plan must be at least equal to 100% (or 110% with respect to holders of more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option as determined by the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.
906709_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	2000 Equity Incentive Plan On April 19, 2000, our Board of Directors adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) by amending and restating our 1994 Equity Incentive Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	On February 9, 2010, the 2000 Plan expired.
906709_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	As a result, no new options may be granted, but existing options granted remain outstanding.
906709_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Pursuant to the 2000 Plan, we granted or issued incentive stock options to employees and officers and non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock bonuses to consultants, employees, officers and non-employee directors.
906709_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	The maximum term of a stock option under the 2000 Plan is eight years.
906709_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	The exercise price of incentive stock options granted under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan must be at least equal to 100% (or 110% with respect to holders of more than 10% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock) of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option as determined by the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.
906709_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	The 1998 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan was adopted by our Board of Directors on August 18, 1998, and was amended and restated in its entirety and renamed the 2000 Non-officer Equity Incentive Plan on June 6, 2000 (2000 Non-Officer Plan).
906709_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	However, with the approval of the 2012 Plan, no new awards will be granted under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan.
906709_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	Pursuant to the 2000 Non-Officer Plan, we granted or issued non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock and stock bonuses to employees and consultants who are neither officers nor directors of Nektar.
906709_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	The maximum term of a stock option under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan is eight years.
906709_13_ITEM8_P83_S2	The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2000 Non-Officer Plan was determined by our Board of Directors by reference to the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.
906709_13_ITEM8_P83_S3	Restricted Stock Units RSU awards have been granted under the 2008 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the 2000 Non-Officer Plan and are settled by delivery of shares of our common stock on or shortly after the date the awards vest.
906709_13_ITEM8_P83_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2010, we granted RSU awards to certain officers, non-employee directors, employees and consultants.
906709_13_ITEM8_P83_S5	We did not grant any RSU awards during the years ended December 31, 2012 or 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	RSU awards are similar to restricted stock in that they are issued for no consideration; however, the holder generally is not entitled to the underlying shares of common stock until the RSU award vests.
906709_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	Also, because the RSU awards are granted for $0.01 per share, the grant-date fair value of the award is equal to the intrinsic value of our common stock on the date of grant.
906709_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	Beginning with shares granted during 2005, each RSU award depletes the pool of options available for grant under our equity incentive plans by a ratio of 1:1.5.
906709_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	In February 1994 , our Board of Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) pursuant to section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
906709_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	Under the ESPP, 1,500,000 shares of our common stock have been authorized for issuance.
906709_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	The terms of the ESPP provide eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in Nektar through participation in a program of periodic payroll deductions for the purchase of our common stock.
906709_13_ITEM8_P86_S3	Employees may elect to enroll or re-enroll in the ESPP on a semi-annual basis.
906709_13_ITEM8_P86_S4	Stock is purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price on the first day of the enrollment period or the last day of the enrollment period.
906709_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	401(k) Retirement Plan We sponsor a 401(k) retirement plan whereby eligible employees may elect to contribute up to the lesser of 60% of their annual compensation or the statutorily prescribed annual limit allowable under Internal Revenue Service regulations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	The 401(k) plan permits us to make matching contributions on behalf of all participants, up to a maximum of $3,000 per participant.

906709_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
906709_13_ITEM8_P125_S1	The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
906709_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	We have federal research credits of approximately $23.7 million, which will begin to expire in 2019 and state research credits of approximately $14.7 million which have no expiration date.
906709_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	We have federal orphan drug credits of $14.0 million which will begin to expire in 2026.
906709_13_ITEM8_P126_S2	These tax credits are subject to the same limitations discussed above.
906709_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law on January 2, 2013.
906709_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	The act retroactively reinstated various expired tax extenders for the 2012 year.
906709_13_ITEM8_P127_S2	None of the extenders included in the Act are material to our financial statements and the impact of the tax law change will be accounted for in 2013 as this is the period of enactment.
906709_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	A change in California law occurred in November 2012 with the enactment of RTC Sec.
906709_13_ITEM8_P128_S1	25128.7 related to apportionment of income.
906709_13_ITEM8_P128_S2	The new law is effective beginning in 2013.
906709_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	All California deferred tax assets have been adjusted using the rates that will be in effect when the deferred tax assets are expected to be utilized.
906709_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits We have incurred net operating losses since inception.
906709_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
906709_13_ITEM8_P130_S2	If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our effective tax rate would be reduced.
906709_13_ITEM8_P130_S3	We currently have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
906709_13_ITEM8_P130_S4	Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.
906709_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Alabama, India and the U.K.
906709_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	The 2009 and 2010 tax years were previously under audit by the IRS.
906709_13_ITEM8_P132_S1	These audits were completed and we received no change letters.
906709_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	The 2005 through 2010 tax years were previously under audit in Alabama.
906709_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	These audits were completed with no changes to the tax liability.
906709_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	Because of net operating losses and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our domestic tax years remain open and subject to examination.
906709_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	We are currently under examination in India for the fiscal years ending 2009 through 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P134_S2	We have the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
906709_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, no interest or penalties were required to be recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	We operate in one business segment which focuses on applying our technology platforms to improve the performance of established and novel medicines.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	We operate in one segment because our business offerings have similar economics and other characteristics, including the nature of products and manufacturing processes, types of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S2	We are comprehensively managed as one business segment by our Chief Executive Officer and his management team.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S3	Within our one business segment we have two components, PEGylation technology and pulmonary technology.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S4	Our revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S5	UCB, Roche, and Affymax represented 30%, 23%, and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S6	Revenue from UCB and Roche represented 27% and 16% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S7	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S8	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_13_ITEM8_P136_S9	At December 31, 2012, $62.5 million, or approximately 87%, of the net book value of our property and equipment was located in the United States and $9.7 million, or approximately 13%, was located in India.

906709_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data.
906709_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	In our opinion, the unaudited information set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth herein.
906709_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results and expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
906709_13_ITEM8_P138_S1	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
906709_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_13_ITEM8_P139_S1	Such reclassifications have not impacted previously reported total revenues, operating loss or net loss.
906709_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	All data is in thousands except per share information.

906709_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_13_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

906709_13_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2012, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P3_S4	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

906709_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology.
906709_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other biologic drug candidates.
906709_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs.
906709_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Our most-advanced proprietary drug candidate, naloxegol (formerly known as NKTR-118), is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, in patients with non-cancer pain, the most common side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines.
906709_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Naloxegol has been specifically designed as a once-daily tablet to block the binding of opioids to the opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract while not crossing the blood brain barrier and impacting the analgesic activity of opioids binding to opioid receptors in the brain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	In November 2013, we reported that our collaboration partner AstraZeneca PLC announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, accepted the New Drug Application, or NDA, for naloxegol, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date of September 16, 2014.
906709_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	The NDA filing was based on comprehensive data from a Phase 3 clinical development program comprised of four clinical trials designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of naloxegol for the treatment of OIC.
906709_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	AstraZeneca has also filed marketing applications for naloxegol with health authorities in the European Union (E.U.) and Canada.
906709_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	The FDA is currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to review the cardiovascular safety and potential additional safety study requirements for peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonist class of drugs, including naloxegol.
906709_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	The FDA advisory committee meeting, which had been originally scheduled for March 10-11, 2014, is being rescheduled due to scheduling conflicts.
906709_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Our second-most-advanced drug candidate, etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), is a next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor, currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical study as a single-agent therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), was initiated by us in December 2011 and enrollment completed in July 2013.
906709_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	The BEACON study enrolled approximately 850 women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	Patients in the BEACON study were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either single-agent etirinotecan pegol or a single agent of physician s choice.
906709_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_14_ITEM1_P5_S5	On January 14, 2014, we announced that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or the DMC, created to provide safety oversight for the BEACON study recommended continuation of the Phase 3 BEACON study following an interim data analysis which was performed after reaching 50% of the events needed to achieve the primary endpoint of overall survival.
906709_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	In November 2012, the FDA designated etirinotecan pegol as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer progressing after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	We have also studied or provided support for ongoing studies being conducted for etirinotecan pegol in bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma, colorectal cancer, metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	Our third most advanced proprietary drug candidate, NKTR-181, is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions.
906709_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	The molecule has been designed to have a slow rate of entry into the brain, which is expected to reduce the attractiveness of the molecule as a target of abuse and reduce other serious central nervous system-related side effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, which are commonly associated with standard opioid therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	Its potential differentiating properties are inherent to the design of the new molecule and, as a new molecular structure, NKTR-181 s abuse deterrent property does not rely on a formulation approach, a common method used with opioid drugs to reduce their ease of conversion into abusable forms of an opioid.
906709_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	In May 2012, the FDA designated NKTR-181 as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	On June 19, 2013, we announced results from that HAL study demonstrated that NKTR-181 was rated similar to placebo in drug liking and feeling high scores and had highly statistically significant lower drug liking scores and reduced feeling high scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_14_ITEM1_P9_S2	On September 26, 2013, we announced preliminary topline results from a Phase 2 clinical study of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_14_ITEM1_P9_S3	In this study, NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P9_S4	However, patients who were randomized to the placebo arm following a drug titration phase did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P9_S5	This lack of a placebo rebound in the maintenance phase of the trial caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint, which was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	In December 2013, we met with the FDA to discuss the results of the Phase 2 clinical study and certain preliminary considerations for the Phase 3 clinical study design.
906709_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	We are currently evaluating the appropriate Phase 3 clinical study design for NKTR-181 and expect to start a Phase 3 clinical study in mid-2014, following the completion of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA planned to occur in the first half of 2014.
906709_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	We also have additional proprietary preclinical and clinical drug candidates being developed for pain relief.
906709_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	On January 14, 2014, we announced that the first subjects were dosed in a Phase 1 clinical study for NKTR-171, a new sodium channel blocker being developed as an oral therapy for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P10_S4	This single-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical study of NKTR-171 will assess its pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety in up to 75 healthy subjects.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	NKTR-171 is a new molecular entity that is specifically designed to treat neuropathic pain by blocking hyperactive neuronal sodium channels associated with damaged nerves in the peripheral nervous system.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	NKTR-171 is designed to be a peripherally-restricted molecule, with the aim of not causing central nervous system (CNS) side effects that limit usage of existing therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	In addition, we are also developing NKTR-192, a novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule with a short-acting profile designed to treat acute pain while addressing the serious CNS-related side effects associated with standard short-acting opioid therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	In January 2014, we announced that we observed elevated liver enzymes in some patients at the highest dose in a Phase 1 clinical study for NKTR-192.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S4	As a result, NKTR-192 will no longer be developed as an oral formulation and has returned to preclinical development where we are exploring its potential as an injectable therapy to treat migraine and acute cancer pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S5	In addition, we are also advancing other acute pain drug candidates in preclinical development.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S6	We have a significant collaboration with Baxter Healthcare (Baxter), to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S7	Under the terms of this collaboration, we are providing our PEGylation technology and expertise and Baxter is responsible for all clinical development.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S8	The first drug candidate in this collaboration, BAX 855, is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein which has completed Phase 1 clinical development in patients with hemophilia A.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S9	In February 2013, Baxter initiated a Phase 3 multi-center, open-label clinical study called PROLONG-ATE in previously treated adult patients with severe hemophilia A to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BAX 855 for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding.
906709_14_ITEM1_P11_S10	On November 13, 2013, Baxter announced that it had completed enrollment of 146 patients in the PROLONG-ATE clinical study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	We also have a significant collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer), to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and the NKTR-061 drug candidate and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer in August 2007 to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	Bayer is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical study for Amikacin Inhale that commenced in April 2013.
906709_14_ITEM1_P12_S3	Bayer is conducting this study under a Special Protocol Assessment process that was agreed to with the FDA in 2011.
906709_14_ITEM1_P12_S4	We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen Inc., MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck Co., Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Pfizer, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche), Regado Biosciences, Inc., and UCB Pharma.
906709_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	A total of eight products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or E.U.
906709_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale and transfer of certain pulmonary technology rights, certain pulmonary collaboration agreements and approximately 140 dedicated pulmonary personnel and operations to Novartis Pharma AG.
906709_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	We retained all of our rights to Amikacin Inhale and our right to receive royalties on net sales of the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG that we transferred to Novartis as part of the transaction.
906709_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	In August 2012, Bayer initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	The two placebo-controlled trials, RESPIRE-1 and RESPIRE-2, are enrolling up to 600 patients and will evaluate Cipro DPI as a chronic, intermittent therapy over a period of 48 weeks.

906709_14_ITEM1_P15_S4	Our Technology Platform As a leader in the PEGylation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer conjugate chemistries and polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules including many classes of drugs targeting numerous disease areas.
906709_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Roche s PEGASYS (PEG-interferon alfa-2a).
906709_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body.
906709_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties.
906709_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics.
906709_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	These techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology.
906709_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in PEGylation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
906709_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	Both our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
906709_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates Our customized approach for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	Two primary examples of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier are naloxegol, an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that AstraZeneca has filed applications for marketing authorizations, and NKTR-171, a novel peripherally-acting sodium channel blocker that is currently in a Phase 1 clinical study for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P21_S4	An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that we plan to initiate Phase 3 clinical studies starting in mid-2014, following the completion of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the first half of 2014.
906709_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	We are using this approach with our lead oncolytic drug candidate, etirinotecan pegol, a next-generation topoisomerase I-inhibitor currently in the Phase 3 BEACON clinical study for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S5	An example of this is BAX 855, a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical development in collaboration with Baxter for the treatment of hemophilia A. Antibody Fragment Polymer Conjugates This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S6	The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_14_ITEM1_P23_S7	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and E.U.
906709_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	To support this strategy, we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of approved drugs as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_14_ITEM1_P27_S5	We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Enter into Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	For example, in December 2010, we decided that we would move etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102) into Phase 3 clinical development in metastatic breast cancer prior to completing a collaboration partnership for this drug candidate.
906709_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P28_S3	The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.

906709_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	* In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA effective as of January 1, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	** Amgen Inc. prevailed in a patent lawsuit against F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) and as a result of this legal ruling Roche is currently prevented from marketing MIRCERA in the U.S. until July 2014.
906709_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with Roche is terminated or expires.
906709_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	This drug candidate was developed using our proprietary pulmonary delivery technology that was transferred by us to Novartis in an asset sale transaction that closed on December 31, 2008.
906709_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	As part of the transaction, Novartis assumed our rights and obligations for Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale) under our agreements with Bayer Schering Pharma AG; however, we maintained the rights to receive royalties on commercial sales of Cipro DPI if the drug candidate is approved.
906709_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	With respect to all of our collaboration and license agreements with third parties, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell naloxegol and naloxegol fixed-dose combination products.
906709_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Naloxegol is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist being investigated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications.
906709_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors.
906709_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur.
906709_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
906709_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Globally, approximately 40 50% (28-35 million) of patients taking opioids for long-term pain develop constipation.
906709_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	It is estimated that approximately 40 50% (11-18 million) of those OIC sufferers achieve the desired treatment outcomes with current options that include over-the-counter and prescription laxatives.
906709_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	AstraZeneca has completed a Phase 3 clinical development program for naloxegol, which AstraZeneca calls the KODIAC studies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	The KODIAC studies (KODIAC-04, KODIAC-05, KODIAC-07 and KODIAC-08) evaluated the efficacy and safety of naloxegol for treating OIC in patients with non-cancer pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	KODIAC-04 and KODIAC-05 were replicate, multicenter- randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials of 12 weeks duration that evaluated 12.5 mg and 25 mg naloxegol administered once-daily.
906709_14_ITEM1_P47_S3	The primary endpoint in both trials was percentage of OIC responders versus placebo over 12 weeks of treatment.
906709_14_ITEM1_P47_S4	The studies enrolled approximately 630 patients each.
906709_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	KODIAC-07 was a three-month safety extension of KODIAC-04.
906709_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	All three studies were conducted in patients with non-cancer pain and documented OIC, who required daily opioid therapy.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	On November 12, 2012, AstraZeneca reported top-line efficacy and safety results from KODIAC-04, -05 and -07.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	For both KODIAC-04 and -05, the 25 mg dose of naloxegol demonstrated statistically significant results for the primary endpoint.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S2	In KODIAC-04, the 12.5 mg dose of naloxegol demonstrated statistically significant results for the primary endpoint and in KODIAC-05 the 12.5 mg dose did not meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	The safety analyses also showed no clinically relevant imbalances in serious adverse events (SAEs), including externally adjudicated major cardiovascular events, across the three treatment arms in KODIAC-04, -05 and -07.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	The most common adverse events (AEs) in the naloxegol treatment arms in both trials were abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S5	In KODIAC-07, the safety extension of KODIAC-04, the occurrence of AEs and SAEs was lower than in KODIAC-04 and -05.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S6	All other common AEs were distributed similarly across the three treatment arms.
906709_14_ITEM1_P49_S7	In KODIAC-04 and -05 for either naloxegol dose, compared to placebo, there were no significant differences in change from baseline in mean daily pain scores or mean total daily opioid dose.
906709_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	KODIAC-08 was an open-label, randomized, 52-week, long-term safety trial of naloxegol versus usual care (UC) in patients with non-cancer related pain and OIC.
906709_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	This trial was designed to evaluate the long-term safety and adverse event profile of naloxegol in patients taking 25 mg of naloxegol once daily, as compared to UC.
906709_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	In the trial, a total of 534 patients received naloxegol once daily for up to 52 weeks, while 270 patients received UC for OIC during the same treatment period.
906709_14_ITEM1_P50_S3	UC was defined as the investigator s choice of an existing laxative treatment regimen for OIC.
906709_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	On February 26, 2013, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results from KODIAC-08.
906709_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	The trial reported no imbalances in SAEs.
906709_14_ITEM1_P51_S2	In addition, there were a low number of major adverse cardiovascular events, as adjudicated by an independent external committee, and there was no imbalance of these events across naloxegol and UC arms.
906709_14_ITEM1_P51_S3	There were no increases from baseline levels in mean daily pain scores or mean total daily opioid dose in either the naloxegol or the UC arm.
906709_14_ITEM1_P51_S4	Additionally, there were no reports of opioid withdrawal AEs which could be attributed to naloxegol.
906709_14_ITEM1_P51_S5	The most commonly reported AEs occurring more frequently on naloxegol than on UC included abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and headache.
906709_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	AstraZeneca submitted an NDA filing in the U.S. on September 25, 2013 and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) filing in the E.U. in August 2013.
906709_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	The PDUFA date for the naloxegol NDA in the US is September 16, 2014.
906709_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	The FDA is currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the cardiovascular safety and potential additional safety study requirements for the peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonist class of drugs, including naloxegol.
906709_14_ITEM1_P52_S3	The advisory committee meeting, which had been originally scheduled for March 10-11, 2014, is being rescheduled due to scheduling conflicts.
906709_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	Naloxegol is currently considered a Schedule II controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) based on structural relatedness to noroxymorphone.
906709_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	AstraZeneca has conducted the studies necessary to evaluate the abuse potential and dependence-producing properties of naloxegol in support of obtaining decontrol.
906709_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	A petition for the decontrol of naloxegol was submitted to the DEA in March 2012 and subsequently accepted for review.
906709_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	Commercialization and launch in the U.S. will be subject to both FDA approval and DEA schedule determination.
906709_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	Under the terms of our license agreement, AstraZeneca made an initial license payment to us of $125.0 million and AstraZeneca has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for naloxegol and naloxegol fixed-dose combination products.
906709_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	For naloxegol, we have received $70.0 million and $25.0 million upon the acceptance for review of naloxegol regulatory approval applications filed by AstraZeneca with the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively, in 2013 and are also entitled to up to an additional $175.0 million upon certain regulatory approval and commercial launch milestones, and $375.0 million in sales milestones if the product achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	If the FDA does not require a future clinical trial or other significant studies to assess the cardiovascular safety (CV Safety Study) of naloxegol prior to an approval decision, AstraZeneca is required to pay us a $35.0 million milestone.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	If the FDA does require a CV Safety Study, AstraZeneca may terminate the license agreement with us in its entirety or only with respect to its rights in the United States.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	If AstraZeneca elects to terminate the license agreement in its entirety due to a CV Safety Study, we would be required to repay them the $70.0 million payment noted above plus accrued interest at 4.5% compounded annually in four installments in accordance with the following payment schedule: $10.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2015, $10.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2016, $20.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2017 and $30.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2018.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	If AstraZeneca elects to terminate the license agreement only with respect to its rights in the U.S., then such repayment amount would be funded through a 50% reduction of non-U.S. royalty amounts otherwise payable to us until the aggregate amount of such royalty reduction equals the total principal amount of $70.0 million plus accumulated interest at 4.5% compounded annually.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S4	If the FDA requires a post-approval cardiovascular safety study as a condition to approval of the naloxegol NDA, then the royalty rate payable to us from net sales of naloxegol in the U.S. by AstraZeneca would be reduced by two percentage points until the aggregate accumulated amount of such royalty payment reduction is equal to a maximum of $35.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S5	The remaining $140.0 million of milestone payments are due upon the commercial launches of naloxegol in the U.S. and in the E.U. For the naloxegol fixed-dose combination products, we are also eligible to receive significant development milestones as well as significant sales milestone payments if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S6	For both naloxegol and the fixed-dose combination products, we are also entitled to significant double-digit royalty payments, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales.
906709_14_ITEM1_P56_S7	Our right to receive royalties (subject to certain adjustments) in any particular country will expire upon the later of (a) a specified period of time after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or (b) the expiration of patent rights in that particular country.
906709_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one naloxegol fixed-dose combination product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine naloxegol with other opioids.
906709_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	We are developing etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), a next generation topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor which was designed using our PEGylation technology.
906709_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Etirinotecan pegol is a novel macromolecular chemotherapeutic designed to enhance the anti-cancer effects of topo I inhibition while minimizing its toxicities.
906709_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Unlike irinotecan, which is a first generation topo I inhibitor that exhibits a high initial peak concentration and short half-life, etirinotecan pegol s pro-drug design results in a lower initial peak concentration of active topo I inhibitor in the blood.
906709_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	The large etirinotecan pegol molecule is inactive when administered.
906709_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	Over time, the body s natural enzymatic processes slowly metabolize the linkers within the molecule, continuously freeing active drug that then can work to stop tumor cell division through topo I inhibition.
906709_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	In preclinical models, etirinotecan pegol achieved a 300-fold increase in tumor concentration as compared to irinotecan.
906709_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	Because etirinotecan pegol is a large molecule, based on preclinical studies we believe that it may penetrate the leaky vasculature within the tumor environment more readily than normal vasculature, concentrating and trapping etirinotecan pegol in tumor tissue.
906709_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	Clinical studies have shown that etirinotecan pegol has an extended pharmacokinetic profile and remains in circulation throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle, providing sustained exposure to topo I inhibition.
906709_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	Etirinotecan pegol is currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy (145 mg/m2 every 21 days) in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), was initiated in December 2011.
906709_14_ITEM1_P62_S2	The BEACON study enrolled approximately 850 patients with metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_14_ITEM1_P62_S3	We completed enrollment in the BEACON study in late July 2013.
906709_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	The physician s choice single agents include the following: ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, eribulin, or a taxane.
906709_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	Randomization was stratified by geographic region, prior treatment with eribulin and whether or not the patient has triple negative breast cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	Secondary endpoints and objectives also include clinical benefit rate, duration of response, pharmacokinetic data, safety profiles, quality-of-life measurements, and pharmacoeconomic implications.
906709_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	Exploratory objectives of the study include collecting specific biomarker data to correlate with objective tumor response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and selected toxicities.
906709_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	In November 2012, the FDA designated etirinotecan pegol as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer progressing after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	On January 14, 2014, we announced that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or the DMC, created to provide safety oversight for the BEACON study recommended continuation of the Phase 3 BEACON study following an interim data analysis which was performed after reaching 50% of the events needed to achieve the primary endpoint of overall survival.
906709_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year.
906709_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman s life is a little less than one in eight (12%).
906709_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	In 2014, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be 235,030 new cases of breast cancer in the United States.
906709_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	Metastatic breast cancer refers to cancer that has spread from the breast to distant sites in the body.
906709_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease.
906709_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	There are currently no FDA-approved topoisomerase I inhibitors to treat breast cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P69_S1	Etirinotecan pegol has also completed a Phase 2 clinical study in approximately 170 patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P69_S2	The Phase 2 clinical study included two phases.
906709_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	The first phase was an open-label, randomized, study evaluating two treatment schedules of single-agent etirinotecan pegol (145 mg/m2 every 14 days or every 21 days).
906709_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	Each schedule originally followed a two-stage Simon design and a total of 71 patients were initially included in the study that was completed in the first half of 2010.
906709_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	The second phase was an expansion of patients in the every 21 day dosing schedule in women with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer who had previously received Doxil therapy.
906709_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	In September 2013, the FDA advised us that a Phase 3 clinical study would be required in order to support an NDA filing for etirinotecan pegol in ovarian cancer; however the FDA also indicated that a positive interim over-all survival analysis in a Phase 3 clinical study could potentially support an accelerated NDA filing prior to completing a Phase 3 clinical study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	In December 2013, we also received scientific advice and protocol assistance from the EMA indicating that a Phase 3 clinical study would be required to support a marketing application for etirinotecan pegol in ovarian cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	The EMA also indicated that a positive interim over-all survival analysis in a Phase 3 clinical study could potentially support a conditional approval of etirinotecan pegol for ovarian cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P71_S4	We do not plan to make a decision on future development for etirinotecan pegol in ovarian cancer until we review the top-line data from the BEACON study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Ovarian cancer is a significant health problem for women worldwide.
906709_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	According to the American Cancer Society, in 2014, there will be an estimated 21,980 new cases of ovarian cancer diagnosed and an estimated 14,270 deaths from ovarian cancer in the United States.
906709_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	Ovarian cancer is the ninth most common cancer among women, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers.
906709_14_ITEM1_P72_S3	It ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
906709_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Historically, less than 40% of women with ovarian cancer are cured.
906709_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	According to the World Health Organization, about 230,000 women globally are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer.
906709_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	An etirinotecan pegol Phase 2 clinical study was initiated in June 2008 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etirinotecan pegol monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	In February 2014, we decided to close enrollment in this study after 80 patients were randomized due to challenges in recruiting new patients because the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the U.S. or E.U. Based on preliminary data we have collected to date from this study, etirinotecan pegol resulted in numerically improved overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response rate, and duration of response compared to that observed in the irinotecan comparator arm.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	However, due to the low number of patients enrolled in this study, we do not expect the results from this study to be statistically significant.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S2	Further, there are currently patients continuing in the study either on drug or in follow-up.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S3	Therefore, the data may change based on future additional data as well as verification and audit procedures that will be performed on the final completed study data.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S4	Following the conclusion of the study and completion of data verification and audit procedures, we currently plan to publish the results from this study at a scientific meeting.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S5	We also conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study which enrolled 26 patients to evaluate etirinotecan pegol in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S6	The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S7	On January 18, 2014, we presented data from this study at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, California.
906709_14_ITEM1_P75_S8	Results from this Phase 1 clinical study include establishing a dose of 75 mg/m2 of etirinotecan pegol in combination with a standard dose of 5-FU/leucovorin and demonstrating clinical activity of etirinotecan pegol in combination with a standard dose of 5-FU/leucovorin clinical activity.
906709_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.
906709_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 137,000 new cases of colon and rectal cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2014, and about 51,000 people will die annually of the disease.
906709_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Worldwide, over 1.2 million people are diagnosed annually with colorectal cancer and, according to the World Health Organization, there are 690,000 deaths annually from colorectal cancers.
906709_14_ITEM1_P76_S3	Most metastatic colorectal cancer patients have recurrence within two years and require retreatment with chemotherapy regimens.
906709_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	In addition to the clinical studies being conducted by us, there are also three investigator-initiated Phase 2 studies being conducted for etirinotecan pegol.
906709_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	On August 7, 2012, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma being conducted at the Stanford Cancer Institute.
906709_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	In May 2013, the study completed enrollment of 20 patients with high-grade glioma who had received a median of three prior lines of therapy before enrolling in the study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	On February 5, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer being conducted at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
906709_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	On October 24, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
906709_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop a specially-formulated Amikacin (BAY41-6551, Amikacin Inhale, formerly called NKTR-061) for the treatment of gram negative pneumonias.
906709_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer is responsible for most future clinical development and commercialization costs, all activities to support worldwide regulatory filings, approvals and related activities, further development of formulated Amikacin and final product packaging for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_14_ITEM1_P79_S2	We are responsible for all future development, manufacturing and supply of the nebulizer device for clinical and commercial use.
906709_14_ITEM1_P79_S3	We have engaged third party contract manufacturers to perform our device manufacturing obligations for this program.
906709_14_ITEM1_P79_S4	We are entitled to up to $50.0 million in development milestone payments as well as sales milestone payments upon achievement of certain annual sales targets.
906709_14_ITEM1_P79_S5	We are also entitled to royalties based on annual worldwide net sales of Amikacin Inhale.
906709_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	product in that country or the expiration of certain patent rights in that particular country, subject to certain exceptions.
906709_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	We share a portion of these royalties with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York under a license agreement.
906709_14_ITEM1_P80_S2	The agreement expires in relation to a particular country upon the expiration of all royalty and payment obligations between the parties related to such country.
906709_14_ITEM1_P80_S3	Subject to termination fee payment obligations in certain circumstances, Bayer also has the right to terminate the agreement for convenience.
906709_14_ITEM1_P80_S4	In addition, the agreement may also be terminated by either party for certain product safety concerns, the product s failure to meet certain minimum commercial profile requirements or uncured material breaches by the other party.
906709_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Gram-negative pneumonias are often the result of complications of other patient conditions or surgeries.
906709_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	Gram-negative pneumonias carry a mortality risk that can exceed 50% in mechanically-ventilated patients and accounts for a substantial proportion of the pneumonias in intensive care units today.
906709_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Amikacin Inhale is designed to be an adjunctive therapy to the current antibiotic therapies administered intravenously as standard of care.
906709_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	The aerosol generator within the nebulizer for Amikacin Inhale delivers a fine aerosol of the antimicrobial agent directly to the site of infection in the lungs.
906709_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	This drug candidate can be integrated with conventional mechanical ventilators or used as a hand-held off-vent device for patients no longer requiring breathing assistance.
906709_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	In April 2013, Bayer initiated enrollment in a global Phase 3 clinical study, which it calls INHALE, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Amikacin Inhale versus aerosolized placebo in the treatment of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia receiving standard of care intravenous antibiotics.
906709_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	The global INHALE development program is comprised of two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, large multi-center global programs involving centers in North America, South America, Europe, Japan, Australia and Asia.
906709_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	The INHALE development program is being conducted by Bayer under a Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the FDA that is intended to support the submission of an NDA if the INHALE clinical studies are successful.
906709_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	NKTR-181 is an orally-available mu-opioid drug candidate in development as a long-acting analgesic to treat chronic pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	NKTR-181 is designed with the objective to address the abuse liability and serious central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with current opioid therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule created using Nektar s proprietary polymer conjugate technology, which provides it with a long-acting profile and slows its entry into the CNS.
906709_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Its potential differentiating properties are inherent to the design of the new molecule and as a new molecular structure.
906709_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	NKTR-181 s abuse deterrent property does not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid.
906709_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	In May 2012, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the NKTR-181 development program.
906709_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	In 2011, we completed two separate Phase 1 clinical studies of NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	The first study, a single-ascending dose study of NKTR-181 evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a 50-fold range of single oral doses of NKTR-181 in 84 healthy subjects at up to 500 mg dose levels.
906709_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	The second study, a multiple-ascending dose study of NKTR-181 evaluated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of four separate dose cohorts of NKTR-181 (100 mg 400 mg) administered orally twice- daily.
906709_14_ITEM1_P88_S3	The study enrolled a total of 60 healthy subjects over an eight-day treatment period, and included a placebo arm (n=3) for each dose cohort.
906709_14_ITEM1_P88_S4	Measurements in the study included plasma concentrations-time profiles, reductions in pupil diameter, and a cold pressor test, a model of pain used in healthy subjects to measure central analgesic activity.
906709_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	In this multiple dose Phase 1 clinical study, NKTR-181 exhibited a sustained analgesic response.
906709_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	Pupillometry data from the study demonstrated that NKTR-181 s centrally-mediated opioid effects are dose-dependent and indicates that the molecule enters the brain slowly, which has the potential to reduce the euphoria and other CNS side effects that are associated with current opioids.
906709_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	NKTR-181 was also well-tolerated at all doses evaluated in both studies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	In June 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Phase 2 clinical study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, enriched enrollment study design.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	enrolled 213 opioid-na ve patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were not getting adequate pain relief from their current non-opioid pain medication.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	Patients who qualified during the baseline period entered a titration phase, during which they were titrated on NKTR-181 tablets administered orally twice-daily until a dose was reached that provided a reduction of at least 20% in the patient s pain score as compared to the patient s own baseline.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S2	Patients that achieved this level of analgesia were then randomized on a 1:1 basis to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive placebo for up to 25 days.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S3	The primary endpoint of the study was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S4	Secondary endpoints of the study included quality-of-life assessment, sleep and motor activity scoring, as well as tolerability endpoints.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S5	On September 26, 2013, we announced results from this Phase 2 efficacy study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S6	Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only 9 (3%) patients were unable to achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S7	During the titration phase, 53 patients (18%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events, most of which are those commonly associated with opioids.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S8	A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S9	Following the titration period, patients were randomized 1:1 to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive placebo for 21 days.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S10	NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study with patients continuing to show a reduction in pain scores throughout the randomized phase of the study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S11	However, patients who were randomized to placebo did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P91_S12	This unusual lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint in the study, which was based upon the average change in a patient s pain score from pre-randomization baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period of the study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	In December 2013, we met with the FDA to discuss the results of the Phase 2 clinical study and certain preliminary considerations for the Phase 3 study design.
906709_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	We are currently evaluating the appropriate Phase 3 clinical trial design for NKTR-181 and plan to start a Phase 3 clinical study in mid-2014, following the completion of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA planned to occur in the first half of 2014.
906709_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	The HAL study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 5-way crossover trial, that compared the effects of three doses of NKTR-181 oral solution (100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg), to the effects of 40 mg of oxycodone oral solution and placebo.
906709_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	Study participants were 42 healthy adults who were not currently physically opioid-dependent but had used opioids to attain non-medical effects on at least 10 occasions during the past year and at least once in the 12 weeks before the study.
906709_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	The study participants sequentially received the five treatments, administered in a randomized, double-blinded fashion, with each treatment separated by a washout period.
906709_14_ITEM1_P93_S4	The study also utilized a Williams Square cross-over design, which uses a series of randomized sequences for each individual subject.
906709_14_ITEM1_P93_S5	The HAL study compared drug liking between each treatment group (oxycodone 40 mg, placebo, and NKTR-181 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg).
906709_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	On the bipolar VAS scale (0-100), a score of 50 indicates that the subject neither likes nor dislikes the drug.
906709_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	In the study, 40 mg of oxycodone oral solution resulted in a maximum mean drug liking score of 85, indicating a strong liking for the effects of oxycodone.
906709_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	The oxycodone liking score was significantly different from placebo as early as 15 minutes after dosing and peaked at 60 minutes.
906709_14_ITEM1_P94_S3	In the placebo arm, the maximum mean drug liking score was 50, indicating that the subjects neither liked nor disliked the effects.
906709_14_ITEM1_P94_S4	In this study, NKTR-181 was rated similar to placebo in drug liking and feeling high scores and had highly statistically significant lower drug liking scores and reduced feeling high scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	On June 19, 2013, we presented data from the HAL study at the 2013 Annual Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence in San Diego, California.
906709_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	According to a 2011 report from the National Academy of Sciences, chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis, back pain and cancer pain, affect at least 100 million adults in the U.S. annually and contribute to over $300 billion a year in lost productivity.
906709_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	The FDA has cited prescription opioid analgesics as being at the center of a major public health crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death.
906709_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	A 2010 report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention notes that emergency room visits tied to the abuse of prescription painkillers was at an all-time high at that point, having increased 111 percent over the preceding five-year period.
906709_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	NKTR-171 (neuropathic pain) NKTR-171 is a novel, orally-available sodium channel blocker and is being developed as a treatment for neuropathic pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	NKTR-171 is a new molecular entity that is designed to treat neuropathic pain by blocking hyperactive neuronal sodium channels associated with damaged nerves in the peripheral nervous system.
906709_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Chronic neuropathic pain arises from nerves injured or damaged by systemic disease, infection, toxins, or physical trauma that are in a continuous state of hyper-excitability, often due to aberrant sodium channel firing.
906709_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	This hyper-excitability results in transmission of abnormal pain signals from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS).
906709_14_ITEM1_P100_S2	Existing therapies that block sodium channels have been shown to provide effective pain relief but are typically associated with significant unwanted CNS side effects, including dizziness, ataxia and somnolence.
906709_14_ITEM1_P100_S3	NKTR-171 is designed to be a peripherally-restricted molecule which selectively blocks hyper-excitable sodium channels without causing the CNS side effects that limit usage of existing therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P100_S4	In January 2014, a single-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical study of NKTR-171 was initiated to assess its pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety in up to 75 healthy subjects.
906709_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	NKTR-192 is a mu-opioid analgesic molecule in preclinical development that is intended to be a short-acting analgesic to treat acute pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	NKTR-192 is also designed to address the abuse liability and serious CNS side effects associated with current opioid therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	NKTR-192 is also designed to have slow entry into the CNS.
906709_14_ITEM1_P101_S3	Its differentiating properties are inherent to the design of the new molecule and as a new molecular structure, NKTR-192 does not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid.
906709_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	NKTR-192 entered Phase 1 clinical development in 2012.
906709_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	In January 2014, we announced data from the multiple ascending dose study for an oral formulation of NKTR-192.
906709_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	NKTR-192 demonstrated low CNS side effects and achieved the target profile for the treatment of acute pain.
906709_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	However, at the highest doses tested in the study, there were several subjects who had elevated liver enzymes.
906709_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	As a result of these data, NKTR-192 will no longer be developed as an oral formulation.
906709_14_ITEM1_P103_S3	We are currently exploring an injectable formulation of NKTR-192 in preclinical development for the treatment of migraine and cancer pain.

906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Drug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S3	It will take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete clinical studies.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S4	The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our and our partners financial constraints.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Drug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of preclinical and clinical development.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S7	The risk of failure increases for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to small molecules, including naloxegol, etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), NKTR-181, NKTR-192, NKTR-171 and other drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S8	The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S9	If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P1_S10	We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive review process for safety and efficacy by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and equivalent foreign government health authorities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The time required for obtaining regulatory decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	The FDA and other U.S. and foreign health authorities have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Further, health authorities have the discretion to analyze data using their own methodologies that may differ from those used by us or our partners which could lead such authorities to arrive at different conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Our partnered drugs that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P3_S4	If the FDA requires a cardiovascular safety study for naloxegol, it could have a material adverse impact on the naloxegol program and our business prospects and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P3_S5	The FDA is exploring whether there is any evidence of potential elevated cardiovascular risk possibly related to the class of mu-opioid antagonist drugs and naloxegol is a mu-opioid antagonist.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	AstraZeneca completed a 52-week, long-term controlled safety trial of naloxegol as part of the Phase 3 naloxegol development program.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	The FDA s general safety concern is based on data from other mu-opioid antagonist programs that may indicate increased cardiovascular risk associated with opioid withdrawal or the antagonism of the delta subtype of the opioid receptor, for which the FDA has not yet made a causal connection between these mechanisms and elevated cardiovascular risk.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	The FDA is currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting for the purposes of reviewing the cardiovascular safety study requirements for peripheral mu-opioid receptor antagonists including naloxegol.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	The advisory committee meeting, which had been originally scheduled for March 10-11, 2014, is being rescheduled due to scheduling conflicts.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We amended our license agreement with AstraZeneca to enter into a risk sharing arrangement in the event that pre-approval or post-approval cardiovascular safety studies are required by the FDA for naloxegol.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	The amendment provides that if the FDA requires a cardiovascular safety study as a condition to approval of naloxegol and, as a result, AstraZeneca terminates its agreement with us in its entirety, we would be required to repay AstraZeneca the $70.0 million we received upon the FDA s acceptance for review of the naloxegol NDA plus accrued interest at 4.5% compounded annually.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If AstraZeneca elects to terminate the agreement only with respect to its license agreement rights in the U.S. due to a pre-approval cardiovascular safety study, then such amount would be paid through a 50% reduction of non-U.S. royalty amounts otherwise payable to us until the aggregate amount of such royalty reduction equals the total principal amount of $70.0 million plus accumulated interest at 4.5% compounded annually.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	On the other hand, if the FDA determines a pre-approval cardiovascular safety study of naloxegol is not required, AstraZeneca is obligated to pay us an additional $35.0 million milestone payment.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	However, if the FDA requires a post-approval cardiovascular safety study as a condition to regulatory approval, then the royalty rate payable to us from net sales of naloxegol in the U.S. by AstraZeneca would be reduced by two percentage points until the aggregate amount of such royalty payment reduction is equal to a maximum of $35.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Even with success in previously completed clinical trials, the risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	A number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in late stage clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy or safety, even after achieving positive results in earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing government health authorities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S7	While etirinotecan pegol, Amikacin Inhale, and BAX 855 have each demonstrated positive results from earlier clinical studies, there is a substantial risk that Phase 3 clinical study outcomes for these drug candidates from larger patient populations will not demonstrate positive efficacy, safety or other clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory filings and achieve regulatory approval.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Phase 3 clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of these Phase 3 clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P5_S9	If one or more of these drug candidates fail in Phase 3 clinical studies, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We are a party to certain significant agreements, including an asset purchase agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we sold a significant portion of our pulmonary business at the end of 2008, the worldwide exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca related to the further development and commercialization of naloxegol, and the purchase and sale agreement with RPI Finance Trust (RPI) related to the sale of our royalty interests in UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA that we completed in February 2012.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Each of these agreements contains complex representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If we breach any of our agreements with Novartis, AstraZeneca, RPI or any third party agreements impacted by these complex transactions, such a breach could result in substantial future liability and harm our financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or third-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If we do not receive substantial milestone payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we had cash and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $262.0 million, of which $25.0 million was restricted in relation to our 12.0% senior secured notes, and indebtedness of approximately $160.8 million.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The indebtedness includes approximately $125.0 million in senior secured notes due July 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	While this royalty obligation liability will not generally be settled in cash, we expect to be required to make a cash payment of $7.0 million in 2014, as a certain performance target is not expected to be met.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	A significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate sufficient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments and we choose to continue our later stage research and development programs, we may need to pursue financing alternatives, including dilutive equity-based financings, such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock, which would dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of our research and development programs.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P10_S4	If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	While we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have not been able to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, there is a risk that in the future a technique could be discovered to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, which would significantly diminish the value of this drug candidate.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	An important objective of our NKTR-181 drug development program is to create a unique opioid molecule that does not rapidly enter a patient s central nervous system and therefore has the potential to be less susceptible to abuse than alternative opioid therapies.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	To date, we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have been unable to convert NKTR-181 into a rapidly-acting, more abusable form of opioid.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	In the future, an alternative chemistry technique, process or method of administration, or combination thereof, may be discovered to enable the conversion of NKTR-181 into a more abusable opioid, which could significantly and negatively impact the potential of NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	If we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The timing of new collaboration partnerships is difficult to predict due to availability of clinical data, the outcomes from our clinical studies, the number of potential partners that need to complete due diligence and approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we are unable to find suitable partners or to negotiate collaboration arrangements with favorable commercial terms with respect to our existing and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Preliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data becomes available.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	From time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For example, we have announced preliminary topline data from our Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Preliminary data remains subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Interim data is also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data becomes available.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S6	Delays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us or our partners could result in delay in regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We or our partners may experience delays in clinical trials of drug candidates.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic breast cancer and BAX 855 are currently in Phase 3 clinical studies, and Bayer has initiated Phase 3 clinical development of BAY41-6551 with the first patient enrolled in April 2013.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S9	A Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is still open for enrollment.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S10	We are currently evaluating the recently announced results from our Phase 2 efficacy clinical study for NKTR-181 and are in the planning stage for a Phase 3 clinical study for NKTR-181 including continuing consultations with leaders in the pain clinical trial field and interactions with the FDA.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Because it is unlikely that we will be able to identify a single cause for the NKTR-181 Phase 2 study not meeting its primary efficacy endpoint, there is increased risk in effectively designing a Phase 3 clinical study to demonstrate the efficacy of NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	and other of our planned clinical studies may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Our clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	changes in health authorities policies or guidance applicable to our drug candidates.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If initiation or completion of any of the planned clinical studies are delayed for our drug candidates for any of the above reasons or otherwise, the approval process could be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of these drug candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	It is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, drug scheduling status, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our successful product candidates following approval by government health authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate or, if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be prevented from developing and selling the drug, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We own more than 175 U.S. and 500 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant and/or broad coverage).
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patents.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S8	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P21_S9	There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply would actually issue as patents, or do so with commercially relevant and/or broad coverage.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	An adverse outcome in any judicial proceeding involving intellectual property, including patents, could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our ability to freely commercialize our technologies or products.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	We are involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S5	From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S6	The third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Costs associated with litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Third-party claims involving proprietary rights or other matters could also result in substantial settlement payments or substantial damages to be paid by us.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	For instance, a settlement might require us to enter a license agreement under which we would pay substantial royalties or other compensation to a third party, diminishing our future economic returns from the related drug.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In December 2013, we entered into a litigation settlement with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) pursuant to which we agree to the payment of a total of $12 million in future installments and certain other terms and conditions in exchange for the full release of certain breach of contract claims by SUNY.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	In October 2011, we entered into a settlement related to trade secret and breach of contract litigation where we agreed to make an upfront payment of $2.7 million and a future contingent payment of $3.0 million if a certain drug candidate receives FDA approval.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S6	In 2006, we entered into a litigation settlement related to an intellectual property dispute with the University of Alabama in Huntsville pursuant to which we paid $11.0 million and agreed to pay an additional $10.0 million in equal $1.0 million installments over ten years ending with the last payment due on July 1, 2016.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S7	In addition, from time to time, we may in the future assert claims against third parties, based on infringement of our proprietary rights or otherwise.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Any such claims may not ultimately be successful, and we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in pursuing them.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to laws and other governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S10	We and our contract manufacturers are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and with laws and regulations governing manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and are subject to inspections by the FDA, DEA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S11	We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S12	Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers adherence to such cGMP and other laws and governmental regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S13	Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S14	The results of these inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S15	Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P25_S16	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	timely manner, we risk delaying our clinical studies or those of our collaboration partners, reducing drug sales by our collaboration partners or breaching contractual obligations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages, and reduce or even eliminate product or royalty revenue.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In some cases, we rely on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply drug product for our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturing of drugs and devices involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstration of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process and analytical methods validations, device performance and challenges in controlling for all of these variables.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party contract manufacturers required for drug and device supply to support our clinical studies and the clinical studies and products of our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Failure by us or our contract manufacturers to supply drug product or devices in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical studies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	In the past we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	We experienced repeated significant delays in starting the Phase 3 clinical development program for Amikacin Inhale as we sought to finalize and validate the device design with a demonstrated capability to be manufactured at commercial scale.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Drug/device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient and doctor use, maintenance of clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, from which we receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and manufacturing revenue.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from significant milestone payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch and the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Our past revenue generated from collaboration agreements is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	If any of our existing or future collaboration partners fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture or ultimately commercialize any product candidate under our collaboration agreement, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospectus could be materially and adversely affected.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	If our partners, on which we depend to obtain regulatory approvals for and to commercialize our partnered drug candidates, are not successful, or if such collaborations fail, the development or commercialization of our partnered drug candidates may be delayed or unsuccessful.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a drug candidate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company is generally expected to:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	market and sell the drugs when and if they are approved.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of risks to our business, including risks that:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Given these risks, the success of our current and future partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We have entered into collaboration agreements in the past that have been subsequently terminated, such as our collaboration agreement with Pfizer, Inc. for the development and commercialization of inhaled insulin that was terminated by Pfizer, Inc. in November 2007.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P36_S3	If other collaboration agreements are suspended or terminated, our ability to commercialize certain other proposed product candidates could also be negatively impacted.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P36_S4	If our collaborations fail, our product development or commercialization of product candidates could be delayed or cancelled, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our products successfully.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must either develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	If we decide to market our products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or indirectly with our partners include:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	To the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially in our control.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S6	We often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunity or contract liability to third parties.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S7	For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S8	Any interruption in supply or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S9	We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S10	We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P38_S11	No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013, we reported a net loss of $162.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	If government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Such third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S6	A government or third- party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S7	We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S8	We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P41_S9	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trials, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Significant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Competitors of our PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technologies include Biogen Idec Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd., Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S (formerly assets held by Neose Technologies, Inc.), and NOF Corporation.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing PEGylation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	There are several competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in development.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	For Amikacin Inhale, the current standard of care includes several approved intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P45_S1	For naloxegol, there are currently several alternative therapies used to address opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD), including subcutaneous Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide), oral Amitizia (lubiprostone), and oral and rectal over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P45_S2	In addition, there are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Develco Pharma, Alkermes, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Theravance, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	For etirinotecan pegol, there are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for breast and ovarian cancers, including, but not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Afinitor (everolimus), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Iniparib, Paraplatin (carboplatin), Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include, but are not limited to, Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Inc.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Eisai, Inc., and Sanofi Aventis S.A.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	There are approved therapies for the treatment of colorectal cancer, including Eloxatin (oxaliplatin), Camptosar (irinotecan), Avastin (bevacizumab), Zaltrap (Ziv-afilbercept), Stivarga (regorafenib), Erbitux (cetuximab), Vectibix (panitumumab), Xeloda (capecitabine), Adrucil (fluorouracil) and Wellcovorin (leucovorin).
906709_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, there are a number of drugs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development from companies exploring cancer therapies or improved chemotherapeutic agents to potentially treat colorectal cancer, including, but not limited to, products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Antigenics, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm Inc., Meditech Research Ltd, Alchemia Limited, and Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P48_S4	These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P48_S5	If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Our decision to bear a majority or all of the clinical development costs of etirinotecan pegol substantially increases our future capital requirements.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S8	If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S9	If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S11	We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S12	Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S13	The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S14	The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S15	We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S16	Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P49_S17	We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, research, regulatory and finance, and may need to attract and retain marketing and distribution experts and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S2	We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S3	Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S5	Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S6	Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S7	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S8	If earthquakes or other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S10	In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S11	There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S12	In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, political instability, or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply materials for drug candidates in development and our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S13	Our collaborative partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S14	We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S15	In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S16	We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P50_S17	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Further, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then-current market prices.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S2	We also have a change of control severance benefit plan, which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S3	This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S4	The price of our common stock is expected to remain volatile.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2013, based on closing prices on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our stock price ranged from $13.96 to $7.54 per share.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S6	We expect our stock price to remain volatile.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P52_S7	A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The indenture governing the senior secured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The indenture governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to take various actions, such as:
906709_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	consummate a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination, or sell, assign, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In addition, the indenture governing the senior secured notes contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring us to maintain a $25.0 million segregated cash reserve account until July 1, 2015 to be applied to interest payments on the notes in the event of a default, subject to certain conditions.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P54_S2	This indenture also requires us not to permit, thereafter and through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, the aggregate balance of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Our ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Our failure to comply with our debt-related obligations could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness and the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes.
906709_14_ITEM1A_P54_S5	The restrictions contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.
906709_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	California We lease a 102,283 square foot facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility), under an operating lease which expires in 2020.

906709_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_14_ITEM6_P4_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_14_ITEM6_P4_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, and immunology.
906709_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other biologic drug candidates.
906709_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule when it is bonded with polymers.
906709_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs.
906709_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our most advanced proprietary product candidate, naloxegol (formerly known as NKTR-118), is an oral peripheral opioid antagonist which has completed Phase 3 clinical studies and has been filed for regulatory approvals in the US, E.U. and Canada for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with non-cancer pain.
906709_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We are a party to an exclusive worldwide license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) for the global development and commercialization of naloxegol and naloxegol fixed-dose combination products (formerly known as NKTR-119).
906709_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The core Phase 3 clinical development program for naloxegol, which AstraZeneca calls the KODIAC program, is comprised of four clinical trials which are designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of naloxegol for the treatment of OIC in patients with non-cancer related pain.
906709_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	The outcome and timing of the naloxegol regulatory review events will have a substantial impact on our financial condition as we are entitled to up to $35.0 million in regulatory milestones and $140.0 million in commercial launch milestones, as well as up to $75 million of payments related to the naloxegol fixed-dose combination program.
906709_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The naloxegol fixed-dose combination program is an early stage research and development program that is designed to combine various opioids with naloxegol AstraZeneca is responsible for all clinical, regulatory and commercialization costs for both the naloxegol drug candidate and all drug candidates within the naloxegol fixed-dose combination program.
906709_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	On November 12, 2012, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results for naloxegol from two Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trials and from a safety extension trial (KODIAC-04, -05, and -07).
906709_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	On February 26, 2013, AstraZeneca announced positive top-line results from the long-term safety study (KODIAC-08) of naloxegol in patients with OIC.
906709_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	On September 25, 2013, the EMA notified AstraZeneca that it had accepted for review the naloxegol regulatory approval application filed by AstraZeneca in August 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	entitled to a $25.0 million payment from AstraZeneca, which was received on September 30, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	On September 16, 2013, AstraZeneca filed an NDA with the FDA for naloxegol, which was accepted for review by the FDA on November 16, 2013, resulting in a $70.0 million milestone payment to Nektar from AstraZeneca in November 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	If the FDA does not require a future clinical trial or other significant studies to assess the cardiovascular safety ( CV Safety Study ) of naloxegol prior to an approval decision, AstraZeneca is obligated to pay us an additional $35.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	If the FDA does require a CV Safety Study, AstraZeneca may terminate the license agreement with us in its entirety or only with respect to its rights in the United States.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	If AstraZeneca elects to terminate the license agreement in its entirety due to a CV Safety Study, we will be required to repay them the $70.0 million we received plus accrued interest at 4.5% compounded annually in four installments in accordance with the following payment schedule: $10.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2015, $10.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2016, $20.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2017 and $30.0 million plus accrued interest on January 15, 2018.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	If AstraZeneca elects to terminate the license agreement only with respect to its rights in the U.S., then such repayment amount would be funded through a 50% reduction of non-U.S. royalty amounts otherwise payable to us until the aggregate amount of such royalty reduction equals the total principal amount of $70.0 million plus accumulated interest at 4.5% compounded annually.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S6	If the FDA requires a post-approval cardiovascular safety study as a condition to approval of the naloxegol NDA, then the royalty rate payable to us from net sales of naloxegol in the U.S. by AstraZeneca would be reduced by two percentage points until the aggregate accumulated amount of such royalty payment reduction is equal to a maximum of $35.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P7_S7	We will be entitled to $140.0 million in commercial launch milestone payments if naloxegol is approved by the FDA and EMA and commercial launch is achieved in the U.S. and one major country in the E.U. As a result, the FDA s determination as to whether to require a CV Safety Study prior to an approval determination and the decisions of both the FDA and E.U. with regard to the marketing applications currently filed for naloxegol is critical to our financial position as well as our future business prospects.
906709_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Our second most advanced proprietary drug candidate, etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), is a next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor.
906709_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Etirinotecan pegol is currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), enrolled approximately 850 patients with metastatic breast cancer that have previously received treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	We completed enrollment in the BEACON study in late July 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P8_S4	On January 14, 2014, we announced that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or the DMC, created to provide safety oversight for the BEACON study recommended continuation of the Phase 3 BEACON study following an interim data analysis which was performed after reaching 50% of the events needed to achieve the primary endpoint of overall survival.
906709_14_ITEM7_P8_S5	The BEACON study will require a substantial investment over the next two years.
906709_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Our third most advanced proprietary drug candidate, NKTR-181, is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions.
906709_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	The molecule has been designed to have a slow rate of entry into the brain, which is expected to reduce the attractiveness of the molecule as a target of abuse and reduce other serious central nervous system-related side effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, which are commonly associated with standard opioid therapies.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	In May 2012, the development program for NKTR-181 for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	On June 19, 2013, we announced positive data from a human abuse liability study of NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	On September 26, 2013, we announced preliminary topline results from a Phase 2 clinical study of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	The Phase 2 study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study design to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only 9 (3%) patients did not achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	During the titration period, 53 (18%) patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events, most of which are those commonly associated with opioids.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S6	A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S7	In this study, NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study.
906709_14_ITEM7_P10_S8	However, patients who were randomized to the placebo arm did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint, which was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	In December 2013, we met with the FDA to discuss the results of the Phase 2 clinical study and certain preliminary considerations for the Phase 3 clinical study design.
906709_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	We are currently evaluating the appropriate Phase 3 clinical study design for NKTR-181 and expect to start a Phase 3 clinical study in mid-2014.
906709_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	We have a significant collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Bayer has initiated a Phase 3 clinical development of BAY41-6551 with the first patient enrolled in April 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and Amikacin Inhale and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer in August 2007 to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	In 2011, Bayer achieved agreement with the FDA on the design of the planned Phase 3 clinical studies of BAY41-6551 under the Special Protocol Assessment process that is intended to support the submission of an NDA if the ongoing Phase 3 clinical study is successful.
906709_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	We also have a significant collaboration with Baxter Healthcare to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	Under the terms of this collaboration, we are providing a license to our PEGylation intellectual property, technology and expertise.
906709_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Baxter is responsible for all clinical development.
906709_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The first drug candidate in this collaboration, BAX 855, is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein which has completed Phase 1 clinical development in patients with Hemophilia A.
906709_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	In February 2013, Baxter initiated a Phase 3 multi-center, open-label clinical study called PROLONG-ATE in previously treated adult patients with severe hemophilia A to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BAX 855 for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding.
906709_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	On November 13, 2013, Baxter announced that it had completed enrollment of 146 patients in the PROLONG-ATE clinical study.
906709_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	If BAX 855 is approved by health authorities and is successfully commercialized by Baxter, this will represent a substantial royalty revenue opportunity for us, subject to significant risks and uncertainties relating to the outcome of the ongoing Phase 3 clinical study, the health authority regulatory review process, and if approved, subsequent commercial success.
906709_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	While the late stage clinical development programs described above are key elements of the future success of our company, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier-stage drug candidate pipeline.
906709_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	In January 2014, we initiated a single-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical study of NKTR-171.
906709_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Further, we have several drug candidates in research that we are preparing to advance into the clinic in future years.
906709_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	While we believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrate positive clinical results and receive regulatory approval in one or more major markets, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results are extremely difficult to predict.
906709_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial prospects, financial condition, and market value.
906709_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary PEGylation reagents on a cost-plus or fixed price basis.
906709_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply PEGylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third-party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2013, we estimated that we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement with RPI Finance Trust.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	As is further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty obligation liability will generally not be settled in cash, but we expect to make a cash payment of $7.0 million in 2014 as a specified worldwide 2013 net sales threshold of MIRCERA is not expected to be met.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S2	On January 28, 2014, we completed the issuance and sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock with gross proceeds of approximately $117.2 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S3	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S4	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, license fees, milestone payments or contract research payments.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S5	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S6	The amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations, such as manufacturing and supply commitments, are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S7	As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S8	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations.
906709_14_ITEM7_P19_S9	Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by us to determine the performance periods.
906709_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Product sales Product sales include fixed price and cost-plus manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	The timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Product sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of an $9.0 million increase in product sales to one of our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Product sales increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 as a result of increased product demand from a number of our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	We currently expect product sales to decrease substantially in 2014 as compared to 2013 due to decreased product demand from our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Royalty revenue received in cash decreased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 and decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of the sale of our rights to receive the royalties from product sales of UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA as is further described below.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Royalties from CIMZIA and MIRCERA recognized after the royalty sale transaction took effect are presented on a separate revenue line item entitled Non-cash royalty revenue related to sale of future royalties.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	We expect royalty revenue received in cash to decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S5	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S6	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S7	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $22.1 million and $13.5 million, respectively, in aggregate royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , of which the $2.7 million recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2012 was retained by us as these amounts resulted from product sales in the fourth quarter of 2011.
906709_14_ITEM7_P22_S9	We expect non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA to decrease slightly in 2014 as compared to 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	License, collaboration and other revenue License, collaboration and other revenue includes the recognition of upfront payments and milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses.
906709_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments, the achievement of milestones, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of reimbursed research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.
906709_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the recognition of a $25.0 million payment from AstraZeneca achieved in September 2013 on the acceptance for review by the EMA of the naloxegol regulatory approval application filed by AstraZeneca, the recognition of a $10.0 million milestone achieved upon the start of the Amikacin Inhale Phase 3 clinical trial by Bayer in April 2013, the recognition of $7.9 million related to the delivery of additional quantities of our proprietary PEGylation reagent to Roche in the fourth quarter of 2013, and the recognition of the remaining $6.7 million deferred revenue balance related to our agreement with Affymax as a result of the termination of that agreement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	License, collaboration and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the recognition in 2011 of a $5.0 million license fee from an agreement signed in September 2011.
906709_14_ITEM7_P23_S4	We expect license, collaboration and other revenue in 2014 will be significantly impacted by the outcome and timing of the naloxegol regulatory review events.
906709_14_ITEM7_P23_S5	In particular, in the event naloxegol is approved by the FDA, we would expect to recognize as revenue the $70.0 million payment received from AstraZeneca in November 2013 and we would be entitled to a $35.0 million milestone payment.
906709_14_ITEM7_P23_S6	If these activities occur in 2014, our license, collaboration and other revenue in 2014 will increase significantly from 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenue by geography Revenue by geographic area is based on locations of our partners.
906709_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The increase in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to increased milestone and royalty revenues from our existing European collaboration partners, including the $25.0 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca described above.
906709_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The increase in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to increased product sales and royalty revenues from our existing European collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	Cost of goods sold and product gross profit increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to the $9.4 million increase in product sales in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	Product gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2013 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	Cost of goods sold increased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to the $10.5 million increase in product sales in 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	The increase in product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to the decreased cost per unit in 2012 resulting from increased manufacturing activity and improved overhead absorption.
906709_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	We expect product gross margin to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level and mix of manufacturing orders from our customers due to the predominantly fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities.
906709_14_ITEM7_P27_S5	We currently expect product gross margin to decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 as a result of the anticipated reduction in product sales.
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of clinical study costs, direct costs of outside research, materials, supplies, licenses and fees as well as personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation).
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of support and facilities-related costs.
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S2	Research and development expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to the etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) Phase 3 BEACON clinical study initiated in December 2011 as well as the NKTR-181 Phase 2 clinical study initiated in July 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S3	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a charge of $11.3 million resulting from the settlement of a dispute with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York related to our collaboration with Bayer to develop inhaled amikacin (see Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S4	The increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily attributable to the $15.2 million increase in direct research and development program costs, a substantial portion of which is attributable to our etirinotecan pegol Phase 3 BEACON study as well as the NKTR-181 Phase 2 clinical study.
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S5	In addition, research and development expense increased due to a $6.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits resulting from increased headcount to support our expanded clinical development activities.
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S6	We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs.
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S7	The following table shows expenses incurred for clinical and regulatory services, clinical supplies, and preclinical study support provided by third parties as well as direct materials costs for each of our drug candidates.
906709_14_ITEM7_P28_S8	The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	(1) Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1.
906709_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we made $11.2 million of prepayments to certain vendors in our BEACON study.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	(3) We partnered this program with Bayer Healthcare LLC in August 2007.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale in 2008, we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	We expect research and development expense to decrease in 2014 as compared to 2013 and to continue at or above the 2012 level.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	We plan to continue to advance etirinotecan pegol in the Phase 3 BEACON study for metastatic breast cancer for which we expect the clinical study to continue through early 2015.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S4	The clinical development costs for the BEACON clinical study will continue to be significant.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S5	We estimate that the total third party and direct material costs over the life of the BEACON study will be approximately $100.0 million, of which $64.7 million was incurred through the end of 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S6	We have also studied or have ongoing studies being conducted for etirinotecan pegol, including investigator-initiated clinical studies, in bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma, colorectal cancer, metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S7	We are unable to estimate the timing or costs to complete the clinical development for etirinotecan pegol across all the potential oncology indications.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S8	In addition to our etirinotecan pegol development activities, in 2014, we plan to commence Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181 and we also plan to continue to advance the development of NKTR-171.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S9	In addition, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale-up for the nebulizer devices to supply Bayer for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S10	Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer, we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for this drug candidate.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S11	We do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with naloxegol or the naloxegol fixed-dose combination products as AstraZeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S12	In addition to our drug candidates that we plan to have in clinical development during 2014 and beyond, we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build the value of our drug candidate pipeline and our business.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S13	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our PEGylation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S14	We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_14_ITEM7_P31_S15	Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
906709_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	In order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development, each drug candidate must be tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies.
906709_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete.
906709_14_ITEM7_P32_S2	The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
906709_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.
906709_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	Furthermore, our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for naloxegol and Amikacin Inhale.
906709_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	In these situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control.
906709_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	General and administrative expense includes the cost of administrative staffing, business development, marketing, finance, and legal activities.
906709_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	General and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	General and administrative expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily as a result of a $2.7 million payment obligation incurred in 2011 related to the settlement of a commercial litigation matter as well as a $2.1 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense in 2012 as compared to 2011.
906709_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	In 2014, we expect general and administrative expenses to be consistent with 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Interest income (in thousands except percentages) Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of lower average cash and investment balances as well as the impact of lower interest rates earned on our investment balances.
906709_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2011.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 is attributable to the interest expense recorded on the senior secured notes we issued in 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million of 12% senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2017.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	In connection with this transaction, we retired a principal amount of $42.5 million of our $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible subordinated notes in exchange for $42.5 million in principal amount of 12% senior secured notes.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S3	We repaid the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in full at maturity on September 28, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S4	The increase in non-cash interest expense on liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011 is attributable to the royalty sale transaction that we completed in 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S5	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S6	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S7	We impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate, which we currently estimate to be approximately 17%.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S8	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the estimated interest rate and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis.
906709_14_ITEM7_P37_S9	As a result, future interest rates could differ significantly and any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively.
906709_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	We expect interest expense and non-cash interest expense in 2014 to be consistent with 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and collaboration agreements, as well as public and private placements of debt and equity.
906709_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $262.0 million in cash and investments in marketable securities, of which $25.0 million was restricted in relation to our 12.0% senior secured notes, and $160.8 million in indebtedness.
906709_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties.
906709_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	As is further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty obligation liability will not generally be settled in cash, but we expect to make a payment of $7.0 million in 2014 as a specified worldwide 2013 net sales threshold of MIRCERA is not expected to be met.
906709_14_ITEM7_P39_S4	On January 28, 2014, we completed the issuance and sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $117.2 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P39_S5	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_14_ITEM7_P39_S6	As of December 31, 2013, we estimated that we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	However, we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S2	In addition, while in the past we have received a number of significant payments from license and collaboration agreements and other significant transactions, we do not currently anticipate completing new transactions with substantial upfront payments in the near-term.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S3	Our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities, including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S4	The availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on the success or failure of our drug development programs, including naloxegol, etirinotecan pegol, BAX 855, Amikacin Inhale, NKTR-181, and NKTR-171.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S5	The availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations all depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies, whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining health authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S6	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments or do not receive the naloxegol milestone payments as discussed above, we would likely be required to pursue financing alternatives.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S7	In the event we determine to pursue financing alternatives, our objective would be to first explore financing alternatives that are not dilutive to the ownership of our common stock security holders.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S8	However, if non-dilutive financing alternatives are not available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we could be required to pursue dilutive equity-based financing alternatives such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S9	If we do not receive substantial milestone payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high-value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S10	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2014 and thereafter, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S11	These investments are generally held to maturity, which, in accordance with our investment policy, is less than two years.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S12	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S13	At December 31, 2013, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately five months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed one year.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S14	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but if such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_14_ITEM7_P40_S15	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $38.5 million, which includes $158.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $15.2 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $135.0 million for milestones from collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront and milestone payments received, if any, will increase in 2014 as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs.
906709_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $129.8 million, which includes $148.3 million of net operating cash uses, partially offset by the receipt of $18.5 million from collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P41_S3	Net operating cash uses also include $6.7 million in interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes retired in full on September 28, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	partially offset by the receipt of $29.5 million from collaboration agreements, of which $16.5 million was included in accounts receivable at December 31, 2010 resulting from an upfront payment obligation arising from an amendment to one of our manufacturing and supply agreements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	Cash flows from investing activities We paid $4.1 million, $10.6 million, and $9.7 million to purchase property and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	We expect our capital expenditures in 2014 to increase significantly as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of our plan to build commercial manufacturing capability for the devices for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S3	Cash flows used in financing activities On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S4	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we made a $3.0 million payment to the purchaser of these royalties because the minimum 2012 MIRCERA net sales threshold was not met.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S6	On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million of senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2017.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S7	As part of this transaction, we incurred approximately $4.5 million in issuance costs.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S8	In connection with this transaction, we retired the principal amount of $42.5 million of our $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in exchange for $42.5 million in principal amount of the senior secured notes.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S9	In addition, $25.0 million of the proceeds from the senior secured notes issuance is required to be maintained in a restricted account until July 1, 2015.
906709_14_ITEM7_P42_S10	On September 28, 2012, we repaid the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes.
906709_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	On January 24, 2011, we completed a public offering of our common stock with gross proceeds of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	As part of the public offering, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_14_ITEM7_P43_S2	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $8.2 million, $4.1 million, and $4.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM7_P43_S3	On January 28, 2014, we completed the issuance and sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $117.2 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P43_S4	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	(1) The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 8 of Item 8.
906709_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	In November 2010, we moved into our Mission Bay Facility, which includes our corporate headquarters and a research and development center.
906709_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	Under the terms of the sublease we entered into with Pfizer Inc. on September 30, 2009 for the Mission Bay Facility, we will begin making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014.
906709_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	On December 28, 2011, we amended the lease of the Mission Bay Facility to include an additional 24,002 square feet of space.
906709_14_ITEM7_P45_S3	Under the terms of the amendment, beginning January 1, 2012, we began making lease payments for this additional space.
906709_14_ITEM7_P45_S4	The sublease is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	(3) These amounts primarily result from capital lease obligations arising from our office space lease at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California.
906709_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	In November 2010, we ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of all of our California functions to our Mission Bay Facility.
906709_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	We have subleased all of the San Carlos Facility.
906709_14_ITEM7_P46_S3	This is further discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	(4) Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2013 that were issued under existing contracts.
906709_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	This amount does not represent any minimum contract termination liabilities for our existing contracts.
906709_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.
906709_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
906709_14_ITEM7_P49_S2	Actual results may differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
906709_14_ITEM7_P49_S3	We have determined that for the periods in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of our operations.
906709_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	Revenue Recognition License, collaboration and other research revenue is recognized based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes amortization of upfront fees.
906709_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	We defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed.
906709_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	Upfront fees are recognized ratably over the expected performance period under each arrangement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, clinical development activities, or manufacturing activities through the completion of clinical development or the termination or expiration of the collaboration agreement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	Given the complexities and uncertainties of collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required by management to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we had $23.5 million of deferred upfront fees related to two collaboration agreements that are being amortized over 11 to 19 years, or an average of 15.2 years.
906709_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	For our collaboration agreements, our performance obligations may span the life of the agreement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	For these, the shortest reasonable period is the end of the development period (estimated to be 4 to 8 years) and the longest period is the contractual life of the agreement, which is generally 10-12 years from the first commercial sale.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	only a 5% to 10% probability of reaching commercial success.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	If we had determined a longer or shorter amortization period was appropriate, our annual upfront fee amortization for these agreements could be as low as $2.2 million or as high as $11.0 million as compared to the $2.4 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we also had $80.7 million of deferred upfront fees related to seven license, manufacturing and supply agreements that are being amortized over periods from 3 to 10 years.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S3	Our performance obligations for these agreements may include technology transfer assistance and/or back-up manufacturing and supply services for a specified period of time; therefore, the time estimated to complete the performance obligations related to licenses is either specified or is much shorter than the collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S4	We may experience delays in the execution of technology transfer plans, which may result in a longer amortization period for applicable agreements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S5	Our original estimates are periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimates to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S6	In addition, at the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S7	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S8	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_14_ITEM7_P55_S9	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical study activities performed by third parties.
906709_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical studies ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_14_ITEM7_P56_S2	If the actual timing of these phases varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual prospectively.
906709_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical studies based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably based on patient enrollment in the studies.
906709_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model for each respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and common stock purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).
906709_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	We expense the estimated fair value of each award, as adjusted by the estimated historical forfeiture rate, ratably over the expected service period of the award.
906709_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under our ESPP.
906709_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	In addition, management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.
906709_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	In addition, for awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments from sales of the CIMZIA and MIRCERA drug products marketed by UCB and Roche, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM7_P62_S1	Although we are required to make payments to the purchaser only in certain situations, including the event of our breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in the Purchase and Sale Agreement that gives rise to a liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement, this royalty sale transaction was recorded as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that we will amortize using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P62_S2	As a result, we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the estimated interest rate.
906709_14_ITEM7_P62_S3	Our estimate of the interest rate under the agreement is based on the amount of royalty payments to be received by RPI over the life of the arrangement and payments we may be required to make to RPI under the agreement.
906709_14_ITEM7_P62_S4	We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche using a combination of historical results and forecasts from market data sources.
906709_14_ITEM7_P62_S5	To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_14_ITEM7_P63_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are higher than expected, non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense would also be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_14_ITEM7_P63_S3	If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2013 should have been one percentage point higher than our current estimate of 17%, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2013 would have increased by $1.5 million.
906709_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that will require the presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to deferred tax assets rather than as a liability when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
906709_14_ITEM7_P64_S1	This guidance is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2014.
906709_14_ITEM7_P64_S2	We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $0.5 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P0_S5	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $0.4 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Due to the potential for continued uncertainty in the credit markets in 2014, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	These investments are generally held to maturity, which is less than two years.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2013, we held $198.0 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of five months.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we currently do not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P3_S4	Accordingly, we believe there are no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities and have not recorded any provisions for impairment.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.
906709_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
906709_14_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
906709_14_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_14_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nektar Therapeutics at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_14_ITEM8_P1_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria).
906709_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	Nektar Therapeutics management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
906709_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
906709_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_14_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
906709_14_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
906709_14_ITEM8_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_14_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Nektar Therapeutics maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.
906709_14_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Nektar Therapeutics and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	NEKTAR THERAPEUTICS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2013 Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Francisco, California and incorporated in Delaware.
906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	We are developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms with the objective to improve the benefits of drugs for patients.
906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our research and development activities have required significant resources to date and are expected to continue to require significant resources.
906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future.
906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S4	We have financed our operations primarily through cash from licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreements as well as financing transactions.
906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S5	At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $262.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities, of which $25.0 million was restricted, and $160.8 million in indebtedness.
906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S6	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties.
906709_14_ITEM8_P9_S7	As is further described in Note 7, this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash, but we expect to make a payment of $7.0 million to the royalty purchaser in 2014 as a certain specified worldwide net sales threshold of MIRCERA is not expected to be met.
906709_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Nektar Therapeutics (India) Private Limited and Nektar Therapeutics UK, Ltd. (Nektar UK).
906709_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
906709_14_ITEM8_P10_S3	Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
906709_14_ITEM8_P10_S4	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity (deficit) section of the balance sheet.
906709_14_ITEM8_P10_S5	To date, such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position.
906709_14_ITEM8_P10_S6	Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recorded in operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 were not material.
906709_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_14_ITEM8_P11_S1	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
906709_14_ITEM8_P11_S2	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to deferred revenue recognition periods, inventories, the impairment of investments, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, contingencies, estimated interest expense from our liability related to our sale of future royalties, stock-based compensation, and ongoing litigation, amongst other estimates.
906709_14_ITEM8_P11_S3	We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
906709_14_ITEM8_P11_S4	These estimates also form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily apparent from other sources.
906709_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	Such reclassifications do not materially impact previously reported total revenue, operating loss or net loss or total assets, liabilities or stockholders equity (deficit).
906709_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	We consider all investments in marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
906709_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	Investments in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year, or where our intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations, are classified as short-term investments.
906709_14_ITEM8_P13_S2	Investments are designated as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity (deficit) as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
906709_14_ITEM8_P13_S3	The disclosed fair value related to our cash equivalents and investments is based primarily on the reported fair values in our period-end brokerage statements, which are based on market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers and generally represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data.
906709_14_ITEM8_P13_S4	We independently validate these fair values using available market quotes and other information.
906709_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale, as well as amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, are included in interest income.
906709_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are included in other income (expense).
906709_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Accounts Receivable and Significant Customer Concentrations Our customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are located in the U.S. and Europe.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	Our accounts receivable balance contains billed and unbilled trade receivables from product sales and royalties, as well as time and materials based billings from collaborative research and development agreements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	When appropriate, we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S3	We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S4	We perform a regular review of our customers payment histories and associated credit risk.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S5	We have not experienced significant credit losses from our accounts receivable.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S6	At December 31, 2013, three different customers represented 30%, 28%, and 28%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S7	At December 31, 2012, four different customers represented 38%, 27%, 14% and 11%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S8	Inventory and Significant Supplier Concentrations Inventory is generally manufactured upon receipt of firm purchase orders from our collaboration partners.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S9	Inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead and cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S10	Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and defective or excess inventory is written down to net realizable value based on historical experience or projected usage.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S11	Inventory related to research and development activities is expensed when purchased.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S12	We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide raw materials, drugs and devices of appropriate quality and reliability and to meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S13	In certain cases, we rely on single sources of supply of one or more critical materials.
906709_14_ITEM8_P16_S14	Consequently, in the event that supplies are delayed or interrupted for any reason, our ability to develop and produce our drug candidates or our ability to meet our supply obligations could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
906709_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
906709_14_ITEM8_P17_S2	Manufacturing, laboratory and other equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over estimated useful lives of three to seven years.
906709_14_ITEM8_P17_S3	Leasehold improvements and buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
906709_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	We periodically review our property and equipment for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
906709_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Generally, an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset.
906709_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for another entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
906709_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	We test for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year using an October 1 measurement date, as well as at other times when impairment indicators exist or when events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
906709_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	We are organized in one reporting unit and have evaluated the goodwill for the Company as a whole.
906709_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	In order to test for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and, if so, we perform a two-step goodwill impairment test.
906709_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount.
906709_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the book value of our assigned goodwill to its implied fair value.
906709_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	We did not recognize any goodwill-related impairment charges during 2013, 2012, or 2011.
906709_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	We enter into arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaboration partners that may involve multiple deliverables.
906709_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	Our arrangements may contain one or more of the following elements: upfront fees, contract research and development, milestone payments, manufacturing and supply payments, royalties, and license fees.
906709_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Each deliverable in the arrangement is evaluated to determine whether it meets the criteria to be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting or whether it should be combined with other deliverables.
906709_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	Revenue is recognized separately for each element.
906709_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	At the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate all consideration received under multiple-element arrangements to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_14_ITEM8_P26_S2	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P26_S3	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material change in our estimates would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Product sales Product sales are primarily derived from cost-plus and fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	We have not experienced any significant returns from our customers.
906709_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	Generally, we are entitled to royalties from our partners based on the net sales of their approved drugs that are marketed and sold in one or more countries where we hold royalty rights.
906709_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	We recognize royalty revenue when the cash is received or when the royalty amount to be received is estimable and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_14_ITEM8_P27_S4	With respect to the non-cash royalties related to sale of future royalties described at Note 7, revenue is recognized when estimable, otherwise, revenue is recognized during the period in which the related royalty report is received, which generally occurs in the quarter after the applicable product sales are made.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	License, collaboration and other Upfront fees received by us in license and collaboration arrangements that include future obligations, such as manufacturing and supply obligations, are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each respective arrangement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research activities, clinical development activities, and manufacturing activities from development through the commercialization of the product.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	Given the uncertainties of these collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S3	Contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved, which we believe is consistent with the substance of our performance under our various license and collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S4	A milestone is defined as an event (i) that can only be achieved based in whole or in part either on the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due to the entity.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S5	A milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent with our performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance, relates solely to our past performance, and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S6	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners provide for payments to us upon the achievement of development milestones, such as the completion of clinical trials or regulatory submissions, approvals by health authorities, and commercial launches of drugs.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S7	Given the challenges inherent in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for drug products and in achieving commercial launches, there was substantial uncertainty whether any such milestones would be achieved at the time of execution of these licensing and collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S8	In addition, we evaluated whether the development milestones meet the remaining criteria to be considered substantive.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S9	As a result of our analysis, we consider our remaining development milestones under all of our license and collaboration agreements to be substantive and, accordingly, we expect to recognize as revenue future payments received from such milestones only if and as each milestone is achieved.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S10	Our license and collaboration agreements with certain partners also provide for contingent payments to us based solely upon the performance of the respective partner.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S11	For such contingent amounts we expect to recognize the payments as revenue when earned under the applicable contract, which is generally upon completion of performance by the respective partner, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S12	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners also provide for payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales volumes of approved drugs.
906709_14_ITEM8_P28_S13	We consider these payments to be similar to royalty payments and we will recognize such sales-based payments upon achievement of such sales volumes, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs We recognize costs related to shipping and handling of product to customers in cost of goods sold.
906709_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock option grants and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), through which employees may purchase our common stock at a discount to the market price.
906709_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_14_ITEM8_P31_S2	Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P31_S3	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination.
906709_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	We expense the value of the portion of the option or award that is ultimately expected to vest based on the historical forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	For awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP is recognized over the respective six-month purchase period.
906709_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	Expense amounts are allocated among inventory, cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense based on the function of the applicable employee.
906709_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Stock-based compensation charges are non-cash charges and as such have no impact on our reported cash flows.
906709_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Research and Development Expense Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits and other operating costs such as outside services, supplies and allocated overhead costs.
906709_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	We perform research and development for our proprietary drug candidates and technology development and for certain third parties under collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	For our proprietary drug candidates and our internal technology development programs, we invest our own funds without reimbursement from a third party.
906709_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical trial activities performed by third parties.
906709_14_ITEM8_P37_S3	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical trials ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_14_ITEM8_P37_S4	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical trials based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the trials.
906709_14_ITEM8_P37_S5	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
906709_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	For all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the net loss available to common stockholders is equal to the reported net loss.
906709_14_ITEM8_P39_S2	Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same due to our historical net losses and the requirement to exclude potentially dilutive securities which would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.
906709_14_ITEM8_P39_S3	The weighted average of these potentially dilutive securities has been excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation and is as follows (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method.
906709_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
906709_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
906709_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.
906709_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	We utilize a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions.
906709_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
906709_14_ITEM8_P42_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	Comprehensive loss Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity (deficit) from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.
906709_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	Our other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net loss, gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of the assets and liabilities of our India and UK subsidiaries, and unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that will require the presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to deferred tax assets rather than as a liability when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists.
906709_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	This guidance is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2014.
906709_14_ITEM8_P44_S2	We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Note 2 Cash and Investments in Marketable Securities Cash and investments in marketable securities, including cash equivalents and restricted cash, are as follows (in thousands): We invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P45_S1	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_14_ITEM8_P45_S2	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in securities with maturities of two years or less and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_14_ITEM8_P45_S3	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, all of our investments had contractual maturities of one year or less and were classified as short-term.
906709_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	Gross unrealized gains and losses were not significant at either December 31, 2013 or 2012.
906709_14_ITEM8_P46_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we sold available-for-sale securities totaling $2.9 million, $5.4 million and $210.1 million respectively, and realized gains and losses were not significant in any of those periods.
906709_14_ITEM8_P46_S2	Restricted cash of $25.0 million is required to be maintained in a separate account until July 1, 2015 under the terms of our 12% Senior Secured Notes due July 2017 (see Note 5).
906709_14_ITEM8_P46_S3	Our portfolio of cash and investments in marketable securities includes (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	All of our investments are categorized as Level 1 or Level 2, as explained in the table above.
906709_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	We use a market approach to value our Level 2 investments.
906709_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
906709_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had letter of credit arrangements in favor of a landlord and certain vendors totaling $2.4 million.
906709_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	These letters of credit are secured by investments of similar amounts.
906709_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	Note 3 Inventory Inventory consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Note 4 Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Building and leasehold improvements include our manufacturing, research and development and administrative facilities and the related improvements to these facilities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Laboratory and manufacturing equipment include assets that support both our manufacturing and research and development efforts.
906709_14_ITEM8_P52_S2	Construction-in-progress includes assets being built to enhance our manufacturing and research and development efforts.
906709_14_ITEM8_P52_S3	Property and equipment includes certain assets acquired through capital leases (see Note 6).
906709_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	In July 2012, we consolidated our U.S.-based research activities into our existing San Francisco facility and ceased use of and plan to sell one of our buildings located in Huntsville, Alabama that was dedicated to research activities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The announcement of this consolidation plan in March 2012 triggered the recognition of a $1.7 million impairment charge relating to these assets in the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	Depreciation expense, including depreciation of assets acquired through capital leases, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $13.0 million, $13.8 million, and $15.0 million, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Note 5 Senior Secured Notes On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes (Senior Notes) with the entire principal amount due on July 15, 2017.
906709_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	The Senior Notes bear interest at 12.0% per annum payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning January 15, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Senior Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets.
906709_14_ITEM8_P54_S3	In connection with this transaction, we retired $42.5 million of principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due September 2012 in exchange for the same principal amount of Senior Notes and received the remaining proceeds in cash, less approximately $4.5 million in transaction costs.
906709_14_ITEM8_P54_S4	We used the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes and our existing cash to repay the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in full at maturity on September 28, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Senior Notes contain customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, and make certain restricted payments, but do not contain covenants related to future financial performance.
906709_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	In particular, $25.0 million of the proceeds is required to be maintained in a restricted account until July 1, 2015 and is classified as restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
906709_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	From July 1, 2015 through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, the aggregate balance of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters is required to be at least $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions.
906709_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	The Senior Notes are callable by us at any time, subject to certain prepayment premiums and conditions.
906709_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	In addition, upon certain asset sales, we may be required to offer to use the net proceeds thereof to purchase some of the Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	As of December 31, 2013, based on a discounted cash flow analysis using Level 3 inputs including financial discount rates, we believe the $125.0 million carrying amount of our 12% Senior Secured Notes due July 2017 is consistent with its fair value.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	We lease office space at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California under a capital lease arrangement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Under the terms of the lease, rent increases up to 3% annually and the lease termination date is October 5, 2016.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	As of November 29, 2010, we ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of our San Carlos operations and corporate headquarters to San Francisco, California.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S3	As a result of our relocation, an impairment test was performed for the building and related leasehold improvements located in San Carlos.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S4	As a result of this impairment test, we recorded an impairment charge of $12.6 million in 2010.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S5	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the gross amount of assets recorded under capital leases was $2.3 million and the recorded value of these assets, net of depreciation, was $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S6	We have subleased all of the San Carlos facility, but have not been relieved of any obligations under the terms of this lease.
906709_14_ITEM8_P58_S7	Our future minimum rental receipts under the San Carlos facility subleases total $7.4 million as of December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	Future minimum payments for our capital leases at December 31, 2013 are as follows (in thousands): Operating Lease On September 30, 2009, we entered into an operating sublease (Sublease) with Pfizer, Inc. for a 102,283 square foot facility located in San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility).
906709_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	Upon completion of construction of the Mission Bay Facility, we moved in on November 29, 2010.
906709_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Mission Bay Facility includes a research and development center with biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and clinical development capabilities, as well as all of the functions previously located in San Carlos, California, including our corporate headquarters.
906709_14_ITEM8_P59_S3	Under the terms of the Sublease, we will begin making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014, after the expiration of our free rent period on August 1, 2014.
906709_14_ITEM8_P59_S4	The Sublease term is 114 months, commencing in August 2010 and terminating on January 31, 2020.
906709_14_ITEM8_P59_S5	Monthly base rent will escalate over the term of the sublease at various intervals.
906709_14_ITEM8_P59_S6	In addition, throughout the term of the Sublease, we are responsible for paying certain costs and expenses specified in the Sublease, including insurance costs and a pro rata share of operating expenses and applicable taxes for the Mission Bay Facility.
906709_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	On December 28, 2011, we expanded our lease of the Mission Bay Facility to include an additional 24,002 square feet of space.
906709_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	The lease term commenced on December 28, 2011 and ends on January 31, 2020.
906709_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	Monthly base rent will escalate over the term of the lease at various intervals.
906709_14_ITEM8_P60_S3	Our future minimum lease payments for our operating leases at December 31, 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
906709_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, rent expense for all our operating leases, including our Mission Bay Facility, was approximately $2.9 million, $2.8 million, and $2.4 million, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Note 7 Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties On February 24, 2012, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with RPI Finance Trust (RPI), an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, pursuant to which we sold, and RPI purchased, our right to receive royalty payments (the Royalty Entitlement) arising from the worldwide net sales, from and after January 1, 2012, of (a) CIMZIA , under Nektar s license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB), and (b) MIRCERA , under Nektar s license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together referred to as Roche).
906709_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	We received aggregate cash proceeds for the Royalty Entitlement of $124.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM8_P62_S2	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs, which will be amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P62_S3	Although we sold all of our rights to receive royalties from the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, as a result of our ongoing manufacturing and supply obligations related to the generation of these royalties, we will continue to account for these royalties as revenue and recorded the $124.0 million in proceeds from this transaction as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that will be amortized using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P62_S4	The following table shows the activity within the liability account during the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the period from the inception of the royalty transaction on February 24, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2013 (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to RPI starting with royalties arising from product sales in the first quarter of 2012, we will continue to recognize revenue for these royalties.
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA upon notification of the actual royalty amount, which occurs in the quarter after such sales are made.
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013, we began to recognize royalties based on estimates of the net sales made in each period, which resulted in an increase in non-cash royalty revenue of $4.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $22.1 and $10.8 million, respectively, in non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S4	As royalties are remitted to RPI from Roche and UCB, the balance of the Royalty Obligation will be effectively repaid over the life of the agreement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S5	In order to determine the amortization of the Royalty Obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by RPI and payments we are required to make to RPI as noted below, if any, over the life of the agreement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S6	The sum of these amounts less the $124.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S7	Since inception, our estimate of this total interest expense resulted in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 17%.
906709_14_ITEM8_P63_S8	We periodically assess the estimated royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche and to the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates, or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are more than expected, the non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense recorded by us would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S3	Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in March 2013, we were required to pay RPI $3.0 million because worldwide net sales of MIRCERA for the 12 month period ended December 31, 2012 did not reach a required threshold.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S4	Furthermore, we are required to make an additional payment of up to $7.0 million if the specified worldwide net sales threshold of MIRCERA for the 12 month period ended December 31, 2013 is not achieved.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S5	We have concluded that it is probable that the minimum 2013 MIRCERA net sales threshold will not be met and, therefore, we expect to make the $7.0 million payment to RPI described above in early 2014.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S6	The liability for this expected $7.0 million payment is included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S7	In addition, the Purchase and Sale Agreement grants RPI the right to receive certain reports and other information relating to the Royalty Entitlement and contains other representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations that are customary for a transaction of this nature.
906709_14_ITEM8_P64_S8	In particular, if we breach our obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we could be required to pay damages to RPI that are not limited to the purchase price we received in the sale transaction.
906709_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	We have third party licenses that require us to pay royalties based on our sales of certain products and/or on our recognition of royalty revenue under certain of our collaboration agreements.
906709_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Royalty expense, which is reflected in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was approximately $4.1 million, $2.9 million, and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	The overall maximum amount of these obligations is based upon sales of the applicable products by our collaboration partners and cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Purchase Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various firm purchase commitments related to contract manufacturing, clinical development and certain other items.
906709_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	As of December 31, 2013, these commitments were approximately $12.6 million, all of which are expected to be paid in 2014.
906709_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
906709_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
906709_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	Such provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
906709_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	If any unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or on our cash flows and liquidity.
906709_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	On November 18, 2009, the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) filed an action against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.
906709_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	SUNY sought to recover amounts it alleged it was owed pursuant to a technology licensing contract between us and SUNY.
906709_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	On December 20, 2013, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release (Settlement) with SUNY.
906709_14_ITEM8_P70_S3	Under the terms of the Settlement, SUNY agreed to dismiss the action with prejudice and relinquish all rights it may have had to a portion of future development and regulatory milestone payments payable to us under the Co-Development, License and Co-Promotion Agreement, dated August 1, 2007, between us (and our subsidiaries) and Bayer Healthcare LLC, as amended, related to the inhaled amikacin program in exchange for (i) a $5.0 million payment due on April 1, 2014; (ii) a $5.0 million payment due on January 1, 2015, (iii) a series of four $500,000 payments each due on April 1, 2014, January 1, 2015, January 1, 2016, and January 1, 2017, respectively; and (iv) certain other terms and conditions.
906709_14_ITEM8_P70_S4	As a result of the Settlement, we recorded a charge of $11.3 million to research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 which reflects the estimated net present value of the $12.0 million settlement payments using an 8% annual discount rate.
906709_14_ITEM8_P70_S5	As of December 31, 2013, the $5.5 million current portion of the $11.3 million settlement liability is included in other current liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
906709_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	During the course of our normal operating activities, we have agreed to certain contingent indemnification obligations as further described below.
906709_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	The term of our indemnification obligations is generally perpetual.
906709_14_ITEM8_P71_S2	There is generally no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P71_S3	To date, we have not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims based on our indemnification obligations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P71_S4	If any of our indemnification obligations is triggered, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Because the aggregate amount of any potential indemnification obligation is not a stated amount, the overall maximum amount of any such obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	No liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013 or 2012.
906709_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	Indemnifications in Connection with Commercial Agreements As part of our collaboration agreements with our partners related to the license, development, manufacture and supply of drugs based on our proprietary technologies and drug candidates, we generally agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our partners from and against third party liabilities arising out of the agreement, including product liability (with respect to our activities) and infringement of intellectual property to the extent the intellectual property is developed by us and licensed to our partners.
906709_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	As part of the sale of our royalty interest in the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, we and RPI made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by indemnity obligations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	Additionally, as part of our pulmonary asset sale to Novartis in 2008, we and Novartis made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by an indemnity obligation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	In the event it is determined that we breached certain of the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements made by us in any such agreements, we could incur substantial indemnification liabilities depending on the timing, nature, and amount of any such claims.
906709_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	Indemnification of Underwriters and Initial Purchasers of our Securities In connection with our sale of equity and senior secured debt securities, we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our underwriters or initial purchasers, as applicable, as well as certain related parties from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
906709_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	Director and Officer Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, we indemnify our directors, executive officers, other officers, employees, and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity.
906709_14_ITEM8_P75_S2	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, we have insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
906709_14_ITEM8_P75_S3	Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1,000,000 per incident for securities related claims and $500,000 per incident for non-securities related claims retention deductible per our insurance policy.
906709_14_ITEM8_P75_S4	However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	We have authorized 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with each share having a par value of $0.0001.
906709_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	In 2011, 3,100,000 shares were previously designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) in connection with our Share Purchase Rights Plan (Rights Plan) that expired on June 1, 2011.
906709_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	On March 30, 2012, we filed a certificate of elimination of the Series A Preferred Stock.
906709_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, no preferred shares are designated, issued or outstanding.
906709_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	On January 24, 2011, we completed the issuance and sale of 19,000,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $220.4 million.
906709_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	On January 28, 2014, we completed the issuance and sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $117.2 million.
906709_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	At December 31, 2013, we had 28,609,480 reserved shares of common stock, all of which are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans as summarized in the following table (share number in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	(1) Includes shares of common stock available for future issuance under our ESPP as of December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Our 2012 Performance Incentive Plan (2012 Plan) was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 4, 2012 and was approved by our stockholders on June 28, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	On the date of approval, any shares of our common stock that were available for issuance under all other previously existing stock plans (the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2000 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan) became available for issuance under the 2012 Plan.
906709_14_ITEM8_P80_S2	In addition, 5,300,000 new shares were made available for award grants under the 2012 Plan.
906709_14_ITEM8_P80_S3	No new awards were granted under any of the previous stock plans after June 28, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM8_P80_S4	Any shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards under the previous stock plans that expire, are cancelled, or otherwise terminate at any time after December 31, 2011 are also available for award grant purposes under the 2012 Plan.
906709_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	The purpose of the 2012 Plan and our other incentive plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward directors, officers, employees, and other eligible persons through the grant of awards and incentives for high levels of individual performance and increasing the value of our business, as well as to further align the interests of award recipients and our stockholders.
906709_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	The 2012 Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, stock bonuses, dividend equivalents, other similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, and other forms of awards granted or denominated in our common stock or units of the company s common stock, as well as cash bonus awards.
906709_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	Directors, officers, or employees, and certain consultants and advisors may receive awards under the 2012 Plan.
906709_14_ITEM8_P81_S3	In 2012 and 2013, the requisite service period for stock options granted to our employees under the 2012 Plan as well as all other previously existing stock plans was generally four years; the requisite service period for stock options granted to our directors was generally one year.
906709_14_ITEM8_P81_S4	The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2012 Plan is 10,347,140 shares, plus any shares subject to outstanding awards under the previous stock plans that expire, are cancelled, or otherwise terminate for any reason.
906709_14_ITEM8_P81_S5	Generally, shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason (except for shares exchanged by a participant or withheld to pay the exercise price of an award granted and related tax withholding obligations) are not paid or delivered under the 2012 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2012 Plan.
906709_14_ITEM8_P81_S6	Shares issued in respect of any award, other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, granted under the 2012 Plan will be counted against the plan s share limit as 1.5 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award.
906709_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	The 2012 Plan will terminate on April 3, 2022, unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors.
906709_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	The maximum term of a stock option or stock appreciation right under the 2012 Plan is eight years from the date of grant.
906709_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	The per share exercise price of an option generally may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the company s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant.
906709_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	In addition to the 2012 Plan, we have other equity incentive plans under which options granted remain outstanding but no new options may be granted either as a result of the approval of the 2012 Plan or plan expiration.
906709_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	These plans include: (i) the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (2008 Plan) which was adopted by the Board of Directors on March 20, 2008 and approved by our stockholders on June 6, 2008; (ii) the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) which was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 19, 2000 by amending and restating our 1994 Equity Incentive Plan, and which expired on February 9, 2010; and (iii) the 1998 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan which was adopted by our Board of Directors on August 18, 1998, and which was amended and restated in its entirety and renamed the 2000 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan on June 6, 2000 (2000 Non-Officer Plan).
906709_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	Pursuant to the 2008 Plan and the 2000 Plan, we previously granted or issued incentive stock options to employees and officers and non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock bonuses to employees, officers, non-employee directors, and consultants.
906709_14_ITEM8_P83_S3	Pursuant to the 2000 Non-Officer Plan, we previously granted or issued non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock and stock bonuses to employees and consultants who are neither officers nor directors of Nektar.
906709_14_ITEM8_P83_S4	The maximum term of a stock option under all of these plans is eight years.
906709_14_ITEM8_P83_S5	Restricted Stock Units RSU awards have been granted under the 2008 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the 2000 Non-Officer Plan and are settled by delivery of shares of our common stock on or shortly after the date the awards vest.
906709_14_ITEM8_P83_S6	We did not grant any RSU awards during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 or 2011 and no RSUs are outstanding at December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	RSU awards are similar to restricted stock in that they are issued for no consideration; however, the holder generally is not entitled to the underlying shares of common stock until the RSU award vests.
906709_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	Also, because the RSU awards are granted for $0.01 per share, the grant-date fair value of the award is equal to the intrinsic value of our common stock on the date of grant.
906709_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	Beginning with shares granted during 2005, each RSU award depletes the pool of options available for grant under our equity incentive plans by a ratio of 1:1.5.
906709_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	In February 1994 , our Board of Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) pursuant to section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
906709_14_ITEM8_P85_S1	Under the ESPP, 1,500,000 shares of our common stock have been authorized for issuance.
906709_14_ITEM8_P85_S2	The terms of the ESPP provide eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in Nektar through participation in a program of periodic payroll deductions for the purchase of our common stock.
906709_14_ITEM8_P85_S3	Employees may elect to enroll or re-enroll in the ESPP on a semi-annual basis.
906709_14_ITEM8_P85_S4	Stock is purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price on the first day of the enrollment period or the last day of the enrollment period.
906709_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	401(k) Retirement Plan We sponsor a 401(k) retirement plan whereby eligible employees may elect to contribute up to the lesser of 60% of their annual compensation or the statutorily prescribed annual limit allowable under Internal Revenue Service regulations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	to a maximum of $3,000 per participant.
906709_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, we recognized $1.0 million, $0.9 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, of compensation expense in connection with our 401(k) retirement plan.
906709_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Change in Control Severance Plan On December 6, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a Change of Control Severance Benefit Plan (CIC Plan).
906709_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	This CIC Plan has subsequently been amended a number of times by our Board of Directors with the most recent amendment occurring on April 5, 2011.
906709_14_ITEM8_P89_S2	The CIC Plan is designed to make certain benefits available to our eligible employees in the event of a change of control of Nektar and, following such change of control, an employee s employment with us or a successor company is terminated in certain specified circumstances.
906709_14_ITEM8_P89_S3	We adopted the CIC Plan to support the continuity of the business in the context of a change of control transaction.
906709_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	The CIC Plan was not adopted in contemplation of any specific change of control transaction.

906709_14_ITEM8_P96_S2	If AstraZeneca elects to terminate the license agreement only with respect to its rights in the U.S., then such repayment amount would be funded through a 50% reduction of non-U.S. royalty amounts otherwise payable to us until the aggregate amount of such royalty reduction equals the total principal amount of $70.0 million plus accumulated interest at 4.5% compounded annually.
906709_14_ITEM8_P96_S3	If the FDA requires a post-approval cardiovascular safety study as a condition to approval of the naloxegol NDA, then the royalty rate payable to us from net sales of naloxegol in the U.S. by AstraZeneca would be reduced by two percentage points until the aggregate accumulated amount of such royalty payment reduction is equal to a maximum of $35.0 million.
906709_14_ITEM8_P96_S4	We will be entitled to the remaining $140.0 million of contingent payments if naloxegol is approved by the FDA and EMA and commercial launch is achieved in the U.S. and one major country in the European Union.

906709_14_ITEM8_P98_S8	As of December 31, 2013, we have deferred revenue of approximately $16.1 million, which we expect to recognize through December 2016, the estimated end of our obligations under this agreement.
906709_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	We determined that these incremental activities should be considered a material modification of the existing PEGASYS and MIRCERA -related arrangements described above.
906709_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	As a result, we allocated the $18.6 million consideration to each of these arrangements and determined the amounts to be recognized or deferred based on the estimated selling prices of the undelivered obligations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P99_S2	As of December 31, 2013, we have deferred revenue of approximately $6.9 million related to these activities, which we expect to recognize through December 2016, the estimated end of our obligations under the modified arrangements.

906709_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	We have never paid dividends, nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, we used a dividend yield of 0.0%.
906709_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	Our estimate of expected volatility is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock at the time of grant over a historical period commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_14_ITEM8_P115_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, we estimated the weighted-average expected life based on the contractual and vesting terms of the stock options, as well as historic cancellation and exercise data.

906709_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	Income tax provision related to continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax loss as follows (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P122_S0	Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
906709_14_ITEM8_P122_S1	Significant components of our deferred tax assets for federal and state income taxes are as follows (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_14_ITEM8_P123_S1	Because of our lack of U.S. earnings history, the net U.S. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
906709_14_ITEM8_P123_S2	The valuation allowance increased by $51.8 million and $43.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
906709_14_ITEM8_P123_S3	The valuation allowance includes approximately $35.6 million of income tax benefit at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 related to stock-based compensation and exercises prior to the implementation of the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation that will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized.
906709_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in India are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly, no deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
906709_14_ITEM8_P124_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income tax.
906709_14_ITEM8_P124_S2	As of December 31, 2013, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $1.7 million of such earnings.
906709_14_ITEM8_P124_S3	At the present time it is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. income taxes that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated.
906709_14_ITEM8_P124_S4	As of December 31, 2013, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,029.7 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2018.
906709_14_ITEM8_P124_S5	We had a total state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $614.6 million, which will begin to expire in 2014.
906709_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
906709_14_ITEM8_P125_S1	The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.
906709_14_ITEM8_P125_S2	We have federal research credits of approximately $36.5 million, which will begin to expire in 2019 and state research credits of approximately $20.9 million which have no expiration date.

906709_14_ITEM8_P125_S4	These tax credits are subject to the same limitations discussed above.
906709_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits We have incurred net operating losses since inception.
906709_14_ITEM8_P126_S1	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
906709_14_ITEM8_P126_S2	If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our effective tax rate would be reduced.
906709_14_ITEM8_P126_S3	We currently have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
906709_14_ITEM8_P126_S4	Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.
906709_14_ITEM8_P127_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Alabama, India and the U.K.
906709_14_ITEM8_P128_S0	The 2009 and 2010 tax years were previously under audit by the IRS.

906709_14_ITEM8_P130_S0	Because of net operating losses and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our domestic tax years remain open and subject to examination.
906709_14_ITEM8_P130_S1	We are currently under examination in India for the fiscal years ending 2009 through 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P130_S2	We have the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
906709_14_ITEM8_P130_S3	Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
906709_14_ITEM8_P130_S4	During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, no significant interest or penalties were recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	We operate in one business segment which focuses on applying our technology platforms to improve the performance of established and novel medicines.
906709_14_ITEM8_P131_S1	We operate in one segment because our business offerings have similar economics and other characteristics, including the nature of products and manufacturing processes, types of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment.
906709_14_ITEM8_P131_S2	We are comprehensively managed as one business segment by our Chief Executive Officer and his management team.
906709_14_ITEM8_P131_S3	Within our one business segment we have two components, PEGylation technology and pulmonary technology.
906709_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	Our revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
906709_14_ITEM8_P132_S1	Roche, UCB, AstraZeneca, and Bayer represented 28%, 21%, 17% and 10% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM8_P132_S2	Revenue from UCB, Roche and Affymax represented 30%, 23%, and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_14_ITEM8_P132_S3	Revenue from UCB and Roche represented 27% and 16% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2011.

906709_14_ITEM8_P133_S3	Additionally, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other offering expenses.
906709_14_ITEM8_P134_S0	The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data.
906709_14_ITEM8_P134_S1	In our opinion, the unaudited information set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth herein.
906709_14_ITEM8_P135_S0	We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results and expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
906709_14_ITEM8_P135_S1	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
906709_14_ITEM8_P136_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_14_ITEM8_P136_S1	Such reclassifications have not materially impacted previously reported total revenues, operating loss or net loss.
906709_14_ITEM8_P137_S0	All data is in thousands except per share information.
906709_14_ITEM8_P138_S0	(1) Quarterly loss per share amounts may not total to the year-to-date loss per share due to rounding.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework).
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S6	We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P3_S2	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P3_S4	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_14_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

906709_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, and immunology.
906709_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other biologic drug candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S2	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life, bioavailability and mechanism of action.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S3	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S4	In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK (previously referred to as naloxegol and NKTR-118), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca).
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S5	MOVANTIK is an oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist (PAMORA), approved in both the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, a common side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S6	MOVANTIK was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S7	On September 16, 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved MOVANTIK as the first once-daily oral PAMORA medication for the treatment of OIC, in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S8	On December 9, 2014, the European Commission, or EC, granted Marketing Authorisation to MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the European Union, or EU) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).
906709_15_ITEM1_P2_S9	The EC s approval applies to all 28 European Union member countries plus Iceland and Norway.
906709_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	On January 23, 2015, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency published its final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately on the date it was published, which removed naloxegol and its salts from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act.
906709_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	AstraZeneca is planning the commercial launch of MOVANTIK in the United States late in the first quarter of 2015 and commercial launch of MOVENTIG in Europe in the second half of 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), is a next-generation topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study as a single-agent therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), has completed enrollment of approximately 850 women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_15_ITEM1_P5_S2	Patients in the BEACON study were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either single-agent etirinotecan pegol or a single agent of physician s choice.
906709_15_ITEM1_P5_S3	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	In November 2012, the FDA designated etirinotecan pegol as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer progressing after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	In January 2014, we announced that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee created to provide safety oversight for the BEACON study recommended continuation of the BEACON study following an interim data analysis which was performed after reaching 50% of the events needed to achieve the primary endpoint of overall survival.
906709_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We have now achieved the necessary number of events in the BEACON study to assess the overall survival primary endpoint and other secondary endpoints.
906709_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	and announce the top-line data from the BEACON Study in March 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	We have also studied etirinotecan pegol in colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer and, in addition, have provided or are providing support for investigator initiated research with etirinotecan pegol in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma, relapsed small cell lung cancer, metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, and with refractory brain metastases in patients with lung cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions.
906709_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	NKTR-181 has been designed to have a slow rate of entry into the brain, which is expected to reduce the attractiveness of the molecule as a target of abuse and reduce other serious central nervous system-related side effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, which are associated with standard opioid therapies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	NKTR-181 s potential abuse deterrent properties are inherent to its novel molecular structure and do not rely on a formulation approach, a common method used with opioid drugs to reduce their ease of conversion into abusable forms of an opioid.
906709_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	In May 2012, the FDA designated NKTR-181 as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	In June 2013, we announced results from a human abuse liability study that demonstrated that NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower drug liking scores and reduced feeling high scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested.
906709_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	In September 2013, we announced topline results from a Phase 2 clinical study of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_15_ITEM1_P10_S3	In this study, NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P10_S4	However, patients who were randomized to the placebo arm following a drug titration phase did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P10_S5	This lack of a placebo rebound in the maintenance phase of the trial caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint, which was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	In October 2014, we had an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA, which included discussions of certain considerations for the Phase 3 clinical study program.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	In this Phase 3 program for NKTR-181 we plan to include two separate efficacy studies in patients with chronic lower back pain, a long-term safety study, and a human abuse liability study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	We enrolled the first patient in this first Phase 3 study on February 24, 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S3	In this first efficacy study, we plan to randomize approximately 416 chronic low back pain patients in a clinical study that utilizes an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S4	The study includes a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 is given to all patients, and then is followed by a 12 week double-blind randomized period where a total of approximately 416 patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to continue receiving NKTR-181 or crossover to receive placebo.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S5	The study design also includes a single interim analysis for sample size reassessment which will be conducted by an independent data monitoring committee.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S6	The primary endpoint will be change in weekly pain score in the double-blind randomized period relative to the baseline pain score and the key secondary endpoints will include percentage of responders ( 30% reduction in pain score) and patient impression of change.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S7	We plan to have further interactions with the FDA to finalize the study design for the other clinical studies planned for the Phase 3 program.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S8	We also have additional proprietary preclinical and clinical drug candidates in research and development.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S9	We have an ongoing Phase 1 clinical development program for NKTR-171, a new sodium channel blocker being developed as a potential oral therapy for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S10	This year we plan to advance NKTR-214, an engineered immune-stimulatory cytokine being developed for the treatment of solid tumors, into a Phase 1 clinical study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S11	NKTR-214 is engineered to selectively activate interlerleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors present on the surface of cytotoxic T cells that kill tumor cells, with relatively low affinity for IL-2 receptors present on the regulatory T cells that would otherwise dampen the immune response to tumors.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S12	We are also advancing numerous other drug candidates in preclinical development in the areas of cancer immunotherapy, pain and other therapeutic indications.
906709_15_ITEM1_P11_S13	We have a collaboration with Baxter Healthcare (Baxter), to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	The first drug candidate in this collaboration is BAX 855, an investigational, extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)].
906709_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	In December 2014, Baxter announced that it filed a biologic license application with the FDA for BAX 855.
906709_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	This regulatory submission was based on positive results from a prospective, global, multi-center, open-label, two-arm Phase 3 study of BAX 855 in 137 previously treated patients.
906709_15_ITEM1_P12_S3	Baxter reported that the results demonstrated that BAX 855 met its primary endpoint in the control and prevention of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis for patients who were 12 years or older.
906709_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	We also have a collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer), to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	We originally developed the NKTR-061 drug candidate and the associated liquid aerosol inhalation platform and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer to advance the drug candidate into further clinical development and potential commercialization.
906709_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	Bayer is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical study for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	Bayer is conducting this study under a Special Protocol Assessment process agreed to with the FDA.
906709_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen Inc., Allergan, Inc., Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc., Merck Co., Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Pfizer, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche), and UCB Pharma.
906709_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	A total of nine products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or E.U.
906709_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale and transfer of certain pulmonary technology rights, certain pulmonary collaboration agreements and approximately 140 dedicated pulmonary personnel and operations to Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis).
906709_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	We retained all of our rights to Amikacin Inhale and our right to receive royalties on net sales of the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG that we transferred to Novartis as part of the transaction.
906709_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	In August 2012, Bayer initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	The two placebo-controlled trials, RESPIRE-1 and RESPIRE-2, are enrolling up to 600 patients and will evaluate Cipro DPI as a chronic, intermittent therapy over a period of 48 weeks.
906709_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	We were incorporated in California in 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998.
906709_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We maintain our executive offices at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South, San Francisco, California 94158, and our main telephone number is (415) 482-5300.

906709_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated in, this Annual Report.
906709_15_ITEM1_P17_S4	Our Technology Platform As a leader in the PEGylation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer conjugate chemistries and polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules including many classes of drugs targeting numerous disease areas.
906709_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Roche s PEGASYS (PEG-interferon alfa-2a).
906709_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body.
906709_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties.
906709_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics.
906709_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	These techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology.
906709_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in PEGylation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
906709_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	Both our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_15_ITEM1_P22_S1	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
906709_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates Our customized approach for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that is currently in Phase 3 development.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S3	We are using this approach with our lead oncolytic drug candidate, etirinotecan pegol, a next-generation topoisomerase I-inhibitor currently in the Phase 3 BEACON clinical study for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S4	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S5	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S6	Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S7	An example of this is BAX 855, a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, for which Baxter filed a biologic license application with the United States Food and Drug Administration on December 1, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S8	This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S9	The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_15_ITEM1_P25_S10	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and E.U.
906709_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	To support this strategy, we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of approved drugs as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Ensure Future Growth of our Proprietary Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts and Advancement of our Preclinical Drug Candidates into Clinical Trials We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	Enter into Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	For example, in December 2010, we decided that we would move etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102) into Phase 3 clinical development in metastatic breast cancer prior to completing a collaboration partnership for this drug candidate.
906709_15_ITEM1_P30_S5	When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P30_S6	The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.
906709_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	The following table summarizes our proprietary drugs and drug candidates that have either received regulatory approval or are being developed by us or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies or independent investigators.

906709_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	* In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA effective as of January 1, 2012.
906709_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	** Amgen Inc. prevailed in a patent lawsuit against F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) and as a result of this legal ruling Roche was prevented from marketing MIRCERA in the U.S. until July 2014.
906709_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with Roche is terminated or expires.
906709_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	This drug candidate was developed using our proprietary pulmonary delivery technology that was transferred by us to Novartis in an asset sale transaction that closed on December 31, 2008.
906709_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	As part of the transaction, Novartis assumed our rights and obligations for Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale) under our agreements with Bayer Schering Pharma AG; however, we maintained the rights to receive royalties on commercial sales of Cipro DPI if the drug candidate is approved.
906709_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	With respect to all of our collaboration and license agreements with third parties, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell MOVANTIK TM and MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination products.
906709_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	MOVANTIK TM was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors.
906709_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur.
906709_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
906709_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	On September 16, 2014, the FDA approved MOVANTIK TM as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	On December 9, 2014, the European Commission, or EC, granted Marketing Authorisation to MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the European Union, or EU) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the EU for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).
906709_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	The EC s approval applies to all 28 European Union member countries plus Iceland and Norway.
906709_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	On January 23, 2015, the DEA published the final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately on the date it was published, removing naloxegol and its salts from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act.
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	AstraZeneca is planning the commercial launch of MOVANTIK in the United States late in the first quarter of 2015 and MOVENTIG in the second half of 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S1	Under the terms of our license agreement, AstraZeneca made an initial license payment to us of $125.0 million and AstraZeneca has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for MOVANTIK TM and MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination products.
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S2	We received $70.0 million and $25.0 million upon the acceptance for review of MOVANTIK TM regulatory approval applications filed with the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively, in 2013.
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S3	In 2014, we received an additional $35.0 million payment upon the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK TM .
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S4	The remaining $140.0 million of development milestone payments are due upon the commercial launches of MOVANTIK TM in the U.S. ($100 million) and in the E.U. ($40 million).
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S5	We are also entitled to up to $375.0 million in sales milestones for MOVANTIK TM if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S6	For the MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination products, we are also eligible to receive significant development milestones as well as significant sales milestone payments if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S7	For both MOVANTIK TM and the fixed-dose combination products, we are also entitled to significant double-digit royalty payments starting at 20% of net sales in the U.S. and 18% of net sales in the E.U. and rest of world, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales.
906709_15_ITEM1_P52_S8	Our right to receive royalties (subject to certain adjustments) in any particular country will expire upon the later of (a) a specified period of time after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or (b) the expiration of patent rights in that particular country.
906709_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine MOVANTIK TM with opioids.
906709_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	We are developing etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), a next generation topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor which was designed using our PEGylation technology.
906709_15_ITEM1_P54_S1	Etirinotecan pegol is a novel macromolecular chemotherapeutic designed to enhance the anti-cancer effects of topo I inhibition while minimizing its toxicities.
906709_15_ITEM1_P54_S2	Unlike irinotecan, which is a first generation topo I inhibitor that exhibits a high initial peak concentration and short half-life, etirinotecan pegol s pro-drug design results in a lower initial peak concentration of active topo I inhibitor in the blood.
906709_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	The large etirinotecan pegol molecule is inactive when administered.
906709_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	Over time, the body s natural enzymatic processes slowly metabolize the linkers within the molecule, continuously freeing active drug that then can work to stop tumor cell division through topo I inhibition.
906709_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	In preclinical models, etirinotecan pegol achieved a 300-fold increase in tumor concentration as compared to irinotecan.
906709_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	Because etirinotecan pegol is a large molecule, based on preclinical studies we believe that it may penetrate the leaky vasculature within the tumor environment more readily than normal vasculature, concentrating and trapping etirinotecan pegol in tumor tissue.
906709_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	Clinical studies have shown that etirinotecan pegol has an extended pharmacokinetic profile and remains in circulation throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle, providing sustained exposure to topo I inhibition.
906709_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	Etirinotecan pegol is currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy (145 mg/m2 every 21 days) in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), enrolled approximately 850 patients with metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	We completed enrollment in the BEACON study in late July 2013.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	This study randomized patients on a 1:1 basis to receive single-agent etirinotecan pegol or a single agent chosen from a defined set of physician s choice alternatives.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S3	The physician s choice single agents include the following: ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, eribulin, or a taxane.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S4	Randomization was stratified by geographic region, prior treatment with eribulin and whether or not the patient had triple negative breast cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S5	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S6	Secondary endpoints and objectives also include clinical benefit rate, duration of response, pharmacokinetic data, safety profiles, quality-of-life measurements, and pharmacoeconomic implications.
906709_15_ITEM1_P59_S7	Exploratory objectives of the study include collecting specific biomarker data to correlate with objective tumor response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and selected toxicities.
906709_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	In November 2012, the FDA designated etirinotecan pegol as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer progressing after treatment with an anthracycline, a taxane, and capecitabine.
906709_15_ITEM1_P61_S0	On January 14, 2014, we announced that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or the DMC, created to provide safety oversight for the BEACON study recommended continuation of the Phase 3 BEACON study following an interim data analysis which was performed after reaching 50% of the events needed to achieve the primary endpoint of overall survival.
906709_15_ITEM1_P61_S1	We are now conducting blinded data verification activities and currently plan to unblind and announce the top-line data from the BEACON Study in March 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P62_S0	According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year.
906709_15_ITEM1_P62_S1	The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman s life is a little less than one in eight (12%).
906709_15_ITEM1_P63_S0	In 2015, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be 231,840 new cases of breast cancer in the U.S. Metastatic breast cancer refers to cancer that has spread from the breast to distant sites in the body.
906709_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	There are currently no FDA-approved topoisomerase I inhibitors indicated to treat breast cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	We have also conducted clinical studies for etirinotecan pegol in other solid tumor settings.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	In 2013, we completed a Phase 2 clinical study for etirinotecan pegol in approximately 170 patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S3	We also initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of etirinotecan pegol monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S4	The Phase 2 clinical study was designed to enroll 174 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S5	In February 2014, we decided to close enrollment in this study after 80 patients were randomized due to challenges in recruiting new patients because the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the U.S. or E.U.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S6	We plan to submit a manuscript describing the results of this study in the first half of 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S7	We also conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study which enrolled 26 patients to evaluate etirinotecan pegol in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S8	The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S9	On January 18, 2014, we presented data from this study at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, California.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S10	In addition to the clinical study of etirinotecan pegol being conducted by us, we are also providing support for four investigator-initiated Phase 2 studies being conducted for etirinotecan pegol.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S11	On August 7, 2012, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma being conducted at the Stanford Cancer Institute.
906709_15_ITEM1_P65_S12	In May 2013, the study completed enrollment of 20 patients with high-grade glioma who had received a median of three prior lines of therapy before enrolling in the study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	to evaluate etirinotecan pegol in patients with brain metastasis from primary lung cancer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	On February 5, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer being conducted at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
906709_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	On October 24, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of etirinotecan pegol in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop a specially-formulated Amikacin (BAY41-6551, Amikacin Inhale, formerly called NKTR-061) for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonias.

906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	We have engaged third party contract manufacturers to perform our device manufacturing activities for this program.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S4	We are entitled to up to $50.0 million in development milestone payments as well as sales milestone payments upon achievement of certain annual sales targets.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S5	We are also entitled to royalties based on annual worldwide net sales of Amikacin Inhale.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S6	Our right to receive these royalties in any particular country will expire upon the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or the expiration of certain patent rights in that particular country, subject to certain exceptions.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S7	We share a portion of these royalties with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York under a license agreement.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S8	The agreement expires in relation to a particular country upon the expiration of all royalty and payment obligations between the parties related to such country.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S9	Subject to termination fee payment obligations in certain circumstances, Bayer also has the right to terminate the agreement for convenience.
906709_15_ITEM1_P67_S10	In addition, the agreement may also be terminated by either party for certain product safety concerns, the product s failure to meet certain minimum commercial profile requirements or uncured material breaches by the other party.
906709_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Gram-negative pneumonias are often the result of complications of other patient conditions or surgeries.
906709_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	Gram-negative pneumonias carry a mortality risk that can exceed 50% in mechanically-ventilated patients and accounts for a substantial proportion of the pneumonias in intensive care units today.
906709_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	Amikacin Inhale is designed to be an adjunctive therapy to the current antibiotic therapies administered intravenously as standard of care.
906709_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	The aerosol generator within the nebulizer for Amikacin Inhale delivers a fine aerosol of the antimicrobial agent directly to the site of infection in the lungs.
906709_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	This nebulizer device containing amikacin can be integrated with conventional mechanical ventilators or used as a hand-held off-vent device for patients no longer requiring breathing assistance.
906709_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	In April 2013, Bayer initiated enrollment in a global Phase 3 clinical study, which it calls INHALE, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Amikacin Inhale versus aerosolized placebo in the treatment of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia receiving standard of care intravenous antibiotics.
906709_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	The global INHALE development program is comprised of two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, large multi-center global programs involving centers in North America, South America, Europe, Japan, Australia and Asia.
906709_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	The INHALE development program is being conducted by Bayer under a Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the FDA that is intended to support the submission of an NDA if the INHALE clinical studies are successful.
906709_15_ITEM1_P71_S3	In November 2014, the FDA granted qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designation to Amikacin Inhale.
906709_15_ITEM1_P71_S4	Antimicrobial drugs designed to treat serious and life-threatening infections, designated as QIDP, are eligible for fast-track designation, priority review by FDA and a five-year extension of market exclusivity.
906709_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	NKTR-181 is an orally-available novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule in development as a long-acting analgesic to treat chronic pain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	serious central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with current opioid therapies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	NKTR-181 was created using Nektar s proprietary polymer conjugate technology, which provides it with a long-acting profile and slows its entry into the CNS.
906709_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	NKTR-181 s abuse deterrent properties are inherent to its novel molecular structure and do not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	In May 2012, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the NKTR-181 development program.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	In June 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	The Phase 2 clinical study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, enriched enrollment study design.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S3	The study enrolled 213 opioid-na ve patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were not getting adequate pain relief from their current non-opioid pain medication.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S4	Patients who qualified during the baseline period entered a titration phase, during which they were titrated on NKTR-181 tablets administered orally twice-daily until a dose was reached that provided a reduction of at least 20% in the patient s pain score as compared to the patient s own baseline.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S5	Patients that achieved this level of analgesia were then randomized on a 1:1 basis to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive placebo for up to 25 days.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S6	The primary endpoint of the study was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S7	On September 26, 2013, we announced results from this Phase 2 efficacy study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S8	Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only 9 (3%) patients were unable to achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S9	A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S10	NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study with patients continuing to show a reduction in pain scores throughout the randomized phase of the study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S11	However, patients who were randomized to placebo did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S12	This unusual lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint in the study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S13	In October 2014, we had an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA, which included discussions of the design of the Phase 3 clinical study program.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S14	In this Phase 3 program for NKTR-181 we plan to include two separate efficacy studies in patients with chronic lower back pain, a long-term safety study, and a human abuse liability study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S15	We enrolled the first patient in this first Phase 3 study on February 24, 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S16	In this first efficacy study, we plan to enroll approximately 416 patients in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which will include a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 is given to all patients, followed by a 12 week double-blind randomized period where subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S17	The study design also includes a single interim analysis for sample size reassessment which will be conducted by an independent data monitoring committee.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S18	The primary endpoint will be change in weekly pain score in the double-blind randomized period relative to the baseline pain score and the key secondary endpoints will include percentage of responders ( 30% reduction in pain score) and patient impression of change.
906709_15_ITEM1_P74_S19	We plan to have further interactions with the FDA to finalize the study design for the other clinical studies planned for the Phase 3 program.
906709_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181.
906709_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower drug liking scores and reduced feeling high scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	On June 19, 2013, we presented data from the HAL study at the 2013 Annual Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence in San Diego, California.
906709_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	According to a 2011 report from the National Academy of Sciences, chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis, back pain and cancer pain, affect at least 100 million adults in the U.S. annually and contribute to over $300 billion a year in lost productivity.
906709_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	However, opioids cause significant problems for physicians and patients because of their serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation, as well as the risks they pose for addiction, abuse, misuse, and diversion.
906709_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death.
906709_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	A 2010 report from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention notes that emergency room visits tied to the abuse of prescription painkillers was at an all-time high at that point, having increased 111 percent over the preceding five-year period.
906709_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	NKTR-171 (neuropathic pain) NKTR-171 is a novel, orally-available sodium channel blocker and is being developed as a treatment for neuropathic pain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	NKTR-171 is a new molecular entity that is designed to treat neuropathic pain by blocking hyperactive neuronal sodium channels associated with damaged nerves in the peripheral nervous system.
906709_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	Chronic neuropathic pain arises from nerves injured or damaged by systemic disease, infection, toxins, or physical trauma that are in a continuous state of hyper-excitability, often due to aberrant sodium channel firing.
906709_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	This hyper-excitability results in transmission of abnormal pain signals from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS).
906709_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	Existing therapies that block sodium channels have been shown to provide effective pain relief but are typically associated with significant unwanted CNS side effects, including dizziness, ataxia and somnolence.
906709_15_ITEM1_P81_S3	NKTR-171 is designed to be a peripherally-restricted molecule which selectively blocks hyper-excitable sodium channels without causing the CNS side effects that limit usage of existing therapies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P81_S4	In January 2014, a single-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical study of NKTR-171 was completed.
906709_15_ITEM1_P81_S5	This study assessed the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of NKTR-171 in healthy subjects.
906709_15_ITEM1_P81_S6	In January 2015, a multiple-ascending dose Phase 1 clinical study was initiated to assess its pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of NKTR-171.
906709_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	NKTR-214 is an engineered immunostimulatory cytokine and is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors.
906709_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	NKTR-214 is engineered to selectively activate IL-2 receptors on the surface of cytotoxic T cells that kill tumor cells while imparting substantially reduced affinity for IL-2 receptors present on the regulatory T cells that would otherwise dampen the immune response to tumors.
906709_15_ITEM1_P82_S2	This receptor selectivity is intended to increase efficacy and improve safety over existing immunostimulatory cytokine drugs.
906709_15_ITEM1_P82_S3	The product candidate is currently in Investigational New Drug application (IND)-enabling studies and we plan to start a Phase 1 clinical study in the second half of 2015.
906709_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	On June 1, 2014, we announced positive preclinical data for NKTR-214 at the ASCO Annual Meeting in Chicago.
906709_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	Nektar scientists conducted a series of studies using preclinical models of breast tumors (EMT6) and colon tumors (CT26) to assess the safety and efficacy of both single agent and combination dosing of NKTR-214 with checkpoint inhibitors, either an anti-PD-1 therapy or an anti-CTLA-4 therapy.
906709_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	The studies also compared NKTR-214 single agent and combination dosing regimens with single agent and combination dosing regimens of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P83_S3	In both the breast and colon tumor models, the combination dosing regimens of NKTR-214 therapy with anti-PD-1 therapy or anti-CTLA-4 therapy resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition.
906709_15_ITEM1_P83_S4	In the aggressive EMT6 breast tumor model where activity with single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy or single-agent anti-CTLA-4 therapy was not observed, pre-dosing of NKTR-214 followed by anti-PD-1 demonstrated better efficacy (tumor growth inhibition of 74%) as compared to a concomitant dosing regimen of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies (tumor growth inhibition of 23%).
906709_15_ITEM1_P83_S5	NKTR-214 was also very well-tolerated when co-dosed with either antibody in these preclinical studies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	Overview of Select Technology Licensing Collaborations and Programs We have a number of product candidates in clinical development and approved products in collaboration with our partners that use our technology or involve rights over which we have patents or other proprietary intellectual property.
906709_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	In a typical collaboration involving our PEGylation technology, we license our proprietary intellectual property related to our PEGylation technology or proprietary conjugated drug molecules in exchange for upfront payments, development milestone payments and royalties from sales of the resulting commercial product as well as sales milestones.
906709_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	In certain cases, we also manufacture and supply our proprietary PEGylation materials to our partners.
906709_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	BAX 855 and Long-Acting Therapies for Hemophilia A, Agreement with Subsidiaries of Baxter International Inc.
906709_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	In September 2005, we entered into an exclusive research, development, license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter Healthcare SA and Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Baxter) to develop products with an extended half-life for the treatment and prophylaxis of Hemophilia A patients using our proprietary PEGylation technology.
906709_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	The first product in this collaboration, BAX 855, is a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein.
906709_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	BAX 855 is a full-length PEGylated longer-acting recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) that was developed to increase the half-life of ADVATE (Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free Method).
906709_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	We are entitled to up to $65.0 million in total development and sales milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales varying by product and country of sale.
906709_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	The royalties start in the mid-single digits for net sales of BAX 855 up to $1.2 billion and then in the low teens for net sales exceeding $1.2 billion.
906709_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	Our right to receive these royalties in any particular country will expire upon the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or the expiration of patent rights in certain designated countries or in that particular country.
906709_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	In 2012, Baxter completed a Phase 1 clinical study for BAX 855 that was a prospective, open-label study assessing the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BAX 855 in 19 previously treated patients age 18 years or older with severe hemophilia A.
906709_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	In January 2013, Baxter announced the top level results from this Phase 1 clinical study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P89_S2	This study demonstrated that the half-life (measuring the duration of activity of the drug in the body) of BAX 855 was approximately 1.5-fold higher compared to ADVATE.
906709_15_ITEM1_P89_S3	A longer half-life was achieved in all patients in the study using BAX 855, no patients developed inhibitors to either base molecule, BAX 855 or PEG, and no patients had allergic reactions.
906709_15_ITEM1_P89_S4	Eleven adverse events were reported in eight patients across both treatment arms, but none was serious, treatment-related or resulted in withdrawal from the study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	Baxter commenced patient enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical study of BAX 855 in the U.S. in February 2013 and completed enrollment in November 2013.
906709_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	The Phase 3 clinical study, a multi-center, open-label study called PROLONG-ATE, enrolled 146 previously treated adult patients with severe hemophilia A in order to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BAX 855 for prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding.
906709_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	In August 2014, Baxter announced positive top-line results from the PROLONG-ATE clinical study which met the primary endpoint for the control and prevention of bleeding, routine prophylaxis and perioperative management for patients who were 12 years or older.
906709_15_ITEM1_P90_S3	In December 2014, Baxter announced that it filed a biologic license application with the FDA for BAX 855.
906709_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale), Agreement with Bayer Schering Pharma AG Assigned to Novartis as of December 31, 2008 We were a party to a collaborative research, development and commercialization agreement with Bayer Schering Pharma AG, (Bayer), related to the development of an inhaled powder formulation of ciprofloxacin delivered by way of a dry powder inhaler, Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale) for the treatment of chronic lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients.
906709_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	On December 31, 2008, we assigned the agreement to Novartis Pharma AG in connection with the completion of the pulmonary asset sale transaction.
906709_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	However, we retained our economic interest in the future potential net sales royalties if Cipro DPI is approved by health authorities and is successfully commercialized by Bayer.
906709_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	Cipro DPI has completed Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of chronic lung infections.
906709_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	In August 2012, Bayer initiated a Phase 3 clinical development program which it calls RESPIRE for Cipro DPI in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	In patients with bronchiectasis, the bronchial tubes are enlarged, allowing mucus to pool and making the area prone to infection.
906709_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	In the two placebo-controlled trials, RESPIRE-1 and RESPIRE-2, Bayer plans to enroll up to 600 patients and to evaluate Cipro DPI as a chronic, intermittent therapy over a period of 48 weeks.
906709_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	In November 2014, the FDA granted qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designation to Cipro DPI.
906709_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	Antimicrobial drugs designed to treat serious and life-threatening infections, designated as QIDP, are eligible for fast-track designation, priority review by FDA and a five-year extension of market exclusivity.
906709_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	In September 2006, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with (OSI) Eyetech, Inc. (Eyetech) under which we granted Eyetech a worldwide, exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize particular products that use our proprietary PEGylation reagent linked with the active ingredient in Fovista .
906709_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	In July 2007, as a result of a divestiture agreement between Eyetech and Ophthotech Corporation (Ophthotech), Ophthotech acquired from Eyetech certain technology rights and other assets owned or controlled by Eyetech relating to particular anti-platelet-derived growth factor aptamers, or anti-PDGFs, including Fovista .
906709_15_ITEM1_P96_S2	As a result of this transaction, Ophthotech assumed the license, manufacturing and supply agreement between Eyetech and us.
906709_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	Fovista is an anti-PDGF agent administered in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (or wet AMD).
906709_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	On May 19, 2014, Ophthotech entered into a Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG to develop and commercialize Fovista and related combination products in all countries outside of the U.S.
906709_15_ITEM1_P97_S2	Under our agreement with Ophthotech, in June 2014 we received a $19.75 million payment in connection with this licensing agreement.
906709_15_ITEM1_P97_S3	We are entitled to up to $9.5 million in total development and sales milestone payments, low- to mid- single-digit royalties on net sales that vary by sales levels and are subject to reduction in the absence of patent coverage, and additional consideration if Ophthotech grants certain third-party commercialization rights to Fovista .

906709_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	In June 2012, Ophthotech announced completion of a prospective, randomized, controlled Phase 2b clinical study of 449 patients with wet AMD comparing Fovista , administered in combination with Lucentis (ranibizumab injection) anti-VEGF therapy with Lucentis monotherapy.
906709_15_ITEM1_P98_S1	Fovista met the pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint of mean vision gain.
906709_15_ITEM1_P98_S2	Patients receiving the combination of Fovista (1.5 mg) and Lucentis gained a mean of 10.6 letters of vision at 24 weeks on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study standardized eye chart, compared to 6.5 letters for patients receiving Lucentis monotherapy (p=0.019), representing a statistically significant 62% additional benefit.
906709_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	In September 2013, Ophthotech announced the initiation of patient enrollment in the first of three planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies of Fovista in combination with anti-VEGF therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed patients with wet AMD.
906709_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	These three studies plan to enroll a total of approximately 1,866 patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fovista .
906709_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	In December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Halozyme, Inc. (Halozyme) under which we granted Halozyme a worldwide, limited exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize particular products that use our proprietary PEGylation reagent linked only with certain qualifying hyaluronidase protein molecules including PEGPH20.
906709_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	According to Halozyme, certain cancers, including pancreatic, breast, colon and prostate, have been shown to accumulate high levels of hyaluronan (HA).
906709_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	Halozyme s FDA-approved, HYLENEX recombinant human hyaluronidase, rHuPH20, is administered subcutaneously and temporarily and reversibly degrades HA to facilitate the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs or fluids and for subcutaneous fluid administration.
906709_15_ITEM1_P101_S2	However, rHuPH20 acts only locally at the injection site, is rapidly inactivated in the body, and does not survive in the blood.
906709_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	PEGPH20 is an investigational PEGylated form of rHuPH20, under development by Halozyme to increase the half-life of the compound in the blood and allow for intravenous administration.

906709_15_ITEM1_P126_S0	OMONTYS (Peginesatide), Agreement with Affymax, Inc.
906709_15_ITEM1_P126_S1	In April 2004, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Affymax, Inc. (Affymax), under which we granted Affymax a worldwide, non-exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize OMONTYS .
906709_15_ITEM1_P127_S0	OMONTYS is a synthetic PEGylated peptidic compound that binds to and stimulates the erythropoietin receptor and thus acts as an erythropoietin stimulating agent (ESA).
906709_15_ITEM1_P127_S1	It is the only ESA that is peptide-based and its building blocks (amino acids) are arranged in a different order than erythropoietin (i.e., it has no sequence homology to endogenous erythropoietin).
906709_15_ITEM1_P128_S0	The compound was discovered by Affymax and is being co-developed and marketed by Affymax and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda).
906709_15_ITEM1_P129_S0	In March 2012, the FDA approved OMONTYS for the treatment of dialysis patients with anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD).
906709_15_ITEM1_P129_S1	OMONTYS is the first once-monthly ESA for anemia in CKD for dialysis patients available in the U.S.
906709_15_ITEM1_P130_S0	On February 23, 2013, Affymax and Takeda announced a voluntary recall of all lots of OMONTYS drug product to the user level as a result of new post-marketing reports regarding serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening or fatal.
906709_15_ITEM1_P130_S1	The FDA has been notified by Affymax of 19 reports of anaphylaxis with 3 of those cases resulting in death.
906709_15_ITEM1_P130_S2	The reported serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred within 30 minutes after such administration of OMONTYS .
906709_15_ITEM1_P130_S3	There have been no reports of such reactions following subsequent dosing, or in patients who have completed their dialysis session.
906709_15_ITEM1_P131_S0	Since launch of the drug, more than 25,000 patients have received OMONTYS in the post-marketing setting.
906709_15_ITEM1_P131_S1	Effective as of April 1, 2013, Affymax announced that it had amended its collaboration agreement with Takeda to transfer regulatory, manufacturing, and development responsibilities for OMONTYS to Takeda.
906709_15_ITEM1_P131_S2	In July 2013, Affymax terminated the license, manufacturing and supply agreement with us.
906709_15_ITEM1_P132_S0	The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries.
906709_15_ITEM1_P132_S1	These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
906709_15_ITEM1_P133_S0	The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms.
906709_15_ITEM1_P133_S1	If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
906709_15_ITEM1_P134_S0	submission to the FDA of an NDA for approval of a drug, a Biological License Application (BLA) for approval of a biological product or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or Premarket Notification 510(k) for a medical device product (a 510(k)).
906709_15_ITEM1_P134_S1	If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA may not be necessary if the company has a right of reference to such data under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Services Act.
906709_15_ITEM1_P134_S2	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation.
906709_15_ITEM1_P134_S3	Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations.
906709_15_ITEM1_P134_S4	The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin.
906709_15_ITEM1_P134_S5	Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires clarification within that period.
906709_15_ITEM1_P135_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review.
906709_15_ITEM1_P135_S1	Drug products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).
906709_15_ITEM1_P135_S2	Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P135_S3	Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
906709_15_ITEM1_P135_S4	Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P135_S5	The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted.
906709_15_ITEM1_P135_S6	The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical study.
906709_15_ITEM1_P136_S0	Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases.
906709_15_ITEM1_P137_S0	Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion.
906709_15_ITEM1_P137_S1	Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
906709_15_ITEM1_P138_S0	identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
906709_15_ITEM1_P138_S1	If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability.
906709_15_ITEM1_P139_S0	The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk.
906709_15_ITEM1_P139_S1	In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S0	Following a series of formal meetings and communications between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S1	The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S2	Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S3	Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S4	Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S5	Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S6	The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs.
906709_15_ITEM1_P140_S7	After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
906709_15_ITEM1_P141_S0	Each manufacturing establishment producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment.
906709_15_ITEM1_P141_S1	Such inspections are also held periodically after the commercialization.
906709_15_ITEM1_P141_S2	Establishments handling controlled substances must also be licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
906709_15_ITEM1_P141_S3	Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements.
906709_15_ITEM1_P141_S4	They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
906709_15_ITEM1_P142_S0	For product candidates currently under development utilizing pulmonary technology, the pulmonary inhaler devices are considered to be part of a drug and device combination for deep lung delivery of each specific molecule.
906709_15_ITEM1_P143_S0	The FDA will make a determination as to the most appropriate center and division within the agency that will assume primary responsibility for the review of the applicable applications, which would consist of an IND and an NDA or BLA where CDER or CBER are determined to have primary jurisdiction or an investigational device exemption application and PMA or 510(k) where the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is determined to have primary jurisdiction.
906709_15_ITEM1_P143_S1	In the case of our product candidates, CDER in consultation with CDRH could be involved in the review.
906709_15_ITEM1_P144_S0	The assessment of jurisdiction within the FDA is based upon the primary mode of action of the drug or the location of the specific expertise in one of the centers.
906709_15_ITEM1_P144_S1	Where CDRH is determined to have primary jurisdiction over a product, 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is required.
906709_15_ITEM1_P145_S0	Medical devices are classified into one of three classes Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
906709_15_ITEM1_P145_S1	Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a Premarket Notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device.
906709_15_ITEM1_P145_S2	This process is known as 510(k) clearance.
906709_15_ITEM1_P145_S3	Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement.
906709_15_ITEM1_P145_S4	Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring PMA approval.
906709_15_ITEM1_P145_S5	To date, our partners have generally been responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, but we may participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for the inhaler device, PEGylation materials or drug.
906709_15_ITEM1_P145_S6	For our proprietary products, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for product candidates being developed under an IND.
906709_15_ITEM1_P146_S0	The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
906709_15_ITEM1_P146_S1	Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.
906709_15_ITEM1_P147_S0	Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs.
906709_15_ITEM1_P147_S1	Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
906709_15_ITEM1_P148_S0	In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.
906709_15_ITEM1_P148_S1	The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years.
906709_15_ITEM1_P148_S2	In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products.
906709_15_ITEM1_P149_S0	Once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity, a second product that is considered to be the same drug for the same indication may be approved during the exclusivity period only if the second product is shown to be clinically superior to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
906709_15_ITEM1_P150_S0	Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the E.U.
906709_15_ITEM1_P151_S0	In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track or Breakthrough designation to a product candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.
906709_15_ITEM1_P151_S1	Important features of Fast Track or Breakthrough designation include a potentially reduced clinical program and close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development.
906709_15_ITEM1_P152_S0	Patents and Proprietary Rights We own more than 215 U.S. and 750 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_15_ITEM1_P152_S1	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1_P152_S2	More specifically, our patents and patent applications cover polymer architecture, drug conjugates, formulations, methods of making polymers and polymer conjugates, methods of administering polymer conjugates, and methods of manufacturing polymers and polymer conjugates.
906709_15_ITEM1_P152_S3	Our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, some of which we acquired in our acquisition of Shearwater Corporation in June 2001.
906709_15_ITEM1_P152_S4	Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world.
906709_15_ITEM1_P152_S5	Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid).
906709_15_ITEM1_P152_S6	In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent.
906709_15_ITEM1_P153_S0	In January 2002, we entered into a Cross-License and Option Agreement with Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Enzon), pursuant to which we and Enzon provided certain licenses to selected portions of each party s PEGylation patent portfolio.
906709_15_ITEM1_P153_S1	In certain cases, we have the option to license certain of Enzon s PEGylation patents for use in our proprietary products or for sublicenses to third parties in each case in exchange for payments to Enzon based on manufacturing profits, revenue share or royalties on net sales if a designated product candidate is approved in one or more markets.
906709_15_ITEM1_P154_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business, associated technology and intellectual property to Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (together referred to as Novartis) for a purchase price of $115.0 million in cash (Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale).
906709_15_ITEM1_P154_S1	In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as of December 31, 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.
906709_15_ITEM1_P154_S2	Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Novartis Pharma AG grants back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights acquired by Novartis from us in the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as well as certain improvements or modifications thereto that are made by Novartis.

906709_15_ITEM1_P155_S1	We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_15_ITEM1_P155_S2	No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_15_ITEM1_P155_S3	Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets.
906709_15_ITEM1_P155_S4	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1_P155_S5	In certain situations in which we work with drugs covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs.
906709_15_ITEM1_P155_S6	Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages.
906709_15_ITEM1_P155_S7	Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S1	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S2	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S3	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage).
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S4	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S5	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patent.
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S6	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_15_ITEM1_P156_S7	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_15_ITEM1_P157_S0	U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights exist that are owned by third parties and relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, medical devices and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions.
906709_15_ITEM1_P157_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, of these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_15_ITEM1_P157_S2	We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims.
906709_15_ITEM1_P157_S3	Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages.
906709_15_ITEM1_P158_S0	In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties.
906709_15_ITEM1_P158_S1	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology.
906709_15_ITEM1_P158_S2	The failure to obtain licenses if needed may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Drug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive and highly uncertain processes.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	It will take us, or our collaborative partners, several years to complete clinical studies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our and our partners financial constraints.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Drug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of preclinical and clinical development.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The risk of failure increases for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to etirinotecan pegol, NKTR-181, NKTR-171, NKTR-214 and other drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	For example, while we recently started a Phase 3 clinical program for NKTR-181 which we believe employs the most appropriate clinical trial design, we were unable to identify a single cause for the Phase 2 study for NKTR-181 not meeting its primary efficacy endpoint, and therefore there is increased risk in effectively designing a Phase 3 clinical program for NKTR-181.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Even with success in previously completed clinical trials, the risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S11	A number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in late stage (i.e. Phase 3) clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy or safety, even after achieving positive results in earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing government health authorities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S12	While etirinotecan pegol and Amikacin Inhale have each demonstrated positive results from earlier clinical studies, there is a substantial risk that Phase 3 clinical study outcomes for these drug candidates from larger patient populations will not demonstrate positive efficacy, safety or other clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory filings and achieve regulatory approval.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S13	Phase 3 clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of these Phase 3 clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S14	If one or more of these drug candidates fail in Phase 3 clinical studies, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P2_S15	Our results of operations and financial condition depend significantly on the ability of our collaboration partners to successfully develop and market drugs and they may fail to do so.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	When we sign a collaborative development agreement or license agreement to develop a drug candidate with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology company is generally expected to:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	market and sell the drugs when and if they are approved.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of significant risks to our business, including risks that:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Given these risks, the success of our current and future collaboration partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business in particular, we expect the commercial outcomes of MOVANTIK , and if approved, BAX 855, to have a particularly significant impact on our near to mid- term financial results and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If our collaboration arrangements underperform or fail, our drug development efforts for our proprietary drug candidate pipeline could be delayed or reduced unless we can secure capital funding from other sources.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital resources to advance our drug candidate pipeline, it would negatively impact the value of our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	It is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, drug scheduling status, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our successful product candidates following approval by government health authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate or, if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We are a party to certain significant agreements, including an asset purchase agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we sold a significant portion of our pulmonary business at the end of 2008, the worldwide exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca related to the further development and commercialization of MOVANTIK TM , and the purchase and sale agreement with RPI Finance Trust (RPI) related to the sale of our royalty interests in UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA that we completed in February 2012.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Each of these agreements contains complex representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we breach any of our agreements with Novartis, AstraZeneca, RPI or any other third party agreements, it could subject us to substantial liabilities and harm our financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	For example, on January 23, 2015, we filed a lawsuit against Allergan and MAP seeking economic damages related to a dispute over the economic sharing provisions of our license agreement with MAP.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or third-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive review process for safety and efficacy by the FDA and equivalent foreign government health authorities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The time required for obtaining regulatory decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	The FDA and other U.S. and foreign health authorities have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Further, health authorities have the discretion to analyze data using their own methodologies that may differ from those used by us or our partners which could lead such authorities to arrive at different conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	For example, AstraZeneca will be conducting a post-marketing, observational epidemiological study comparing MOVANTIK TM to other treatments of OIC in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain and the results of this study could at some point in the future negatively impact the labeling, regulatory status, and commercial potential of MOVANTIK TM .
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our partnered drugs that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we do not receive substantial milestone or royalty payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $262.8 million, of which $25.0 million was restricted in relation to our 12.0% senior secured notes, and indebtedness of approximately $151.8 million.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	The indebtedness includes approximately $125.0 million in senior secured notes due July 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties as this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate sufficient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments and we choose to continue our later stage research and development programs, we may need to pursue financing alternatives, including dilutive equity-based financings, such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock, which would dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of our research and development programs.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	While we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have not been able to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, there is a risk that a technique could be discovered in the future to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, which would significantly diminish the value of this drug candidate.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	An important objective of our NKTR-181 drug development program is to create a unique opioid molecule that does not rapidly enter a patient s central nervous system and therefore has the potential to be less susceptible to abuse than alternative opioid therapies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S6	To date, we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have been unable to convert NKTR-181 into a rapidly-acting, more abusable form of opioid.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In the future, an alternative chemistry technique, process or method of administration, or combination thereof, may be discovered to enable the conversion of NKTR-181 into a more abusable opioid, which could significantly and negatively impact the commercial potential or diminish the value of NKTR-181.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The timing of new collaboration partnerships is difficult to predict due to availability of clinical data, the outcomes from our clinical studies, the number of potential partners that need to complete due diligence and approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If we are unable to find suitable partners or negotiate collaboration arrangements with favorable commercial terms with respect to our existing and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Preliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data become available.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	From time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Preliminary data remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Interim data are also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Delays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us or our partners could result in delay in regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We or our partners may experience delays in clinical trials of drug candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We currently have ongoing Phase 3 studies for etirinotecan pegol in patients with metastatic breast cancer and NKTR-181 in patients with chronic lower back pain.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, our collaboration partners have several ongoing Phase 3 clinical programs including Baxter for BAX 855, Bayer for Amikacin Inhale and CIPRO Inhale, and Ophthotech for Fovista .
906709_15_ITEM1A_P20_S4	These and other clinical studies may not begin on time, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Our clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	changes in health authorities policies or guidance applicable to our drug candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If the initiation or completion of any of the planned clinical studies for our drug candidates is delayed for any of the above or other reasons, the regulatory approval process would be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of these drug candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	In certain cases, we have existing licenses or cross-licenses with third parties; however, the scope and adequacy of these licenses is very uncertain and can change substantially during long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be prevented from developing and selling the drug, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We own more than 215 U.S. and 750 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant and/or broad coverage).
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patents.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S7	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P24_S9	There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply would actually issue as patents, or do so with commercially relevant and/or broad coverage.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	An adverse outcome in any judicial proceeding involving intellectual property, including patents, could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our ability to freely commercialize our technologies or products.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	We are involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	The third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P26_S7	Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, they could effectively prevent us, or our partners, from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Costs associated with litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Third-party claims involving proprietary rights or other matters could also result in substantial settlement payments or substantial damages to be paid by us.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	For instance, a settlement might require us to enter a license agreement under which we would pay substantial royalties or other compensation to a third party, diminishing our future economic returns from the related drug.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In December 2013, we entered into a litigation settlement with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) pursuant to which we agree to the payment of a total of $12.0 million in future installments and certain other terms and conditions in exchange for the full release of certain breach of contract claims by SUNY.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In addition, from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings where we or other third parties are enforcing or seeking intellectual property rights, invalidating or limiting patent rights that have already been allowed or issued, or otherwise asserting proprietary rights through one or more potential legal remedies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	PEGylated Factor VIII which we have exclusively licensed to Baxter.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The subject matter of our patent filings in this proceeding relates to Bayer s investigational PEGylated recombinant Factor VIII compound.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	We believe that Bayer s claim to an ownership interest in these patent filings is without merit and are vigorously defending sole and exclusive ownership rights to this intellectual property.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	We are also regularly involved in opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office where third parties seek to invalidate or limit the scope of our allowed European patents applications covering (among other things) our drugs and platform technologies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	The cost to us in initiating or defending any litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management s attention.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts or result in financial implications either in terms of seeking license arrangements or payment of damages or royalties.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to laws and other governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S7	We and our contract manufacturers are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and with laws and regulations governing manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and are subject to inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions administering such compliance.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S8	We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S9	Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers adherence to such cGMP and other laws and governmental regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S10	Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S11	The results of these inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P29_S12	Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient drug quantities meeting applicable quality standards required to support large clinical studies or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner, it could delay our or our collaboration partners clinical studies or result in a breach of our contractual obligations, which could in turn reduce the potential commercial sales of our or our collaboration partners products.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages and any product sales or royalty revenue that we would otherwise be entitled to receive could be reduced, delayed or eliminated.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In some cases, we rely on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply drug product for our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturing of drugs and devices involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstration of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process and analytical methods validations, device performance and challenges in controlling for all of these variables.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party contract manufacturers required for drug and device supply to support our clinical studies and the clinical studies and products of our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Failure by us or our contract manufacturers to supply drug product or devices in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical studies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In the past we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We experienced repeated significant delays in starting the Phase 3 clinical development program for Amikacin Inhale as we sought to finalize and validate the device design with a demonstrated capability to be manufactured at commercial scale.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Drug/device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient and doctor use, maintenance of clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, from which we receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and manufacturing revenue.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from significant milestone payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch and the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P35_S3	The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	If any of our existing or future collaboration partners fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture or ultimately commercialize any product candidate under our collaboration agreement, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospectus could be materially and adversely affected.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our products successfully.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P36_S2	We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P36_S3	To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must either develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P36_S4	If we decide to market our products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P36_S5	Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or indirectly with our partners include:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S2	To the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S3	To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and are only partially in our control important examples of this risk include MOVANTIK partnered with AstraZeneca and BAX 855 partnered with Baxter.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S5	We purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S6	We often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunity or contract liability to third parties.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S7	For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P37_S8	Any interruption in supply or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P38_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported a net loss of $53.9 million.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	If government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P40_S3	Such third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P40_S5	Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P40_S6	A government or third- party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Though we are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trials, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S6	The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P41_S7	Significant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Competitors of our PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technologies include Biogen Idec Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd., Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S (formerly assets held by Neose Technologies, Inc.), and NOF Corporation.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing PEGylation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	There are several competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in development.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	For Amikacin Inhale, the current standard of care includes several approved intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Subcutaneous Injection, oral Amitizia (lubiprostone), and oral and rectal over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	In addition, there are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Develco Pharma GmbH, Alkermes, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Theravance, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	For etirinotecan pegol, there are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for breast and ovarian cancers, including, but not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Xeloda (capecitabine), Afinitor (everolimus), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Ibrance (palbociclib), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Iniparib, Paraplatin (carboplatin), Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include, but are not limited to, Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, Inc.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Eisai, Inc., and Sanofi Aventis S.A.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Camptosar (irinotecan), Avastin (bevacizumab), Zaltrap (Ziv-afilbercept), Stivarga (regorafenib), Erbitux (cetuximab), Vectibix (panitumumab), Xeloda (capecitabine), Adrucil (fluorouracil) and Wellcovorin (leucovorin).
906709_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In addition, there are a number of drugs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development from companies exploring cancer therapies or improved chemotherapeutic agents to potentially treat colorectal cancer, including, but not limited to, products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Antigenics, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm Inc. (acquired by Insys Therapeutics, Inc.), Meditech Research Ltd, Alchemia Limited, and Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P48_S5	If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S3	Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S5	Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S6	Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Our decision to bear a majority or all of the clinical development costs of etirinotecan pegol substantially increases our future capital requirements.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S8	If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S9	If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S10	Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S11	We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S12	Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P49_S13	The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S5	We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, research, regulatory and finance, and may need to attract and retain marketing and distribution experts and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S6	We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S8	Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S9	Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S10	Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S11	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S12	If earthquakes or other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S13	Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S14	In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S15	There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S16	In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, political instability, or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply materials for drug candidates in development and our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S17	Our collaborative partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S18	We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S19	In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S20	We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P50_S21	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Further, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S2	These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then-current market prices.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S3	We also have a change of control severance benefit plan, which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S4	This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S5	The price of our common stock is expected to remain volatile.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S6	During the year ended December 31, 2014, based on closing prices on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our stock price ranged from $10.53 to $17.05 per share.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S7	We expect our stock price to remain volatile.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P51_S8	A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including the risks described in this section titled Risk Factors and the following:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	At times, our stock price has been volatile even in the absence of significant news or developments.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The stock prices of biotechnology companies and securities markets generally have been subject to dramatic price swings in recent years.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The indenture governing the senior secured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The indenture governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to take various actions, such as:
906709_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	consummate a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination, or sell, assign, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In addition, the indenture governing the senior secured notes contains a financial maintenance covenant requiring us to maintain a $25.0 million segregated cash reserve account until July 1, 2015 to be applied to interest payments on the senior secured notes in the event of a default, subject to certain conditions.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P55_S2	This indenture also requires us not to permit, thereafter and through the quarter ending June 30, 2017, the aggregate balance of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters to be less than $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Our ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Our failure to comply with our debt-related obligations could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness and the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes.
906709_15_ITEM1A_P55_S5	The restrictions contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.

906709_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_15_ITEM6_P4_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_15_ITEM6_P4_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, and immunology.
906709_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and other biologic drug candidates.
906709_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule.
906709_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs.
906709_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK (previously referred to as naloxegol and NKTR-118), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca.
906709_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	MOVANTIK is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, a side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines.
906709_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	MOVANTIK was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	On September 16, 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved MOVANTIK as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	On December 9, 2014, the European Commission, or EC, granted Marketing Authorisation to MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the European Union, or EU) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).
906709_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	The EC s approval applies to all 28 European Union member countries plus Iceland and Norway.
906709_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	On January 23, 2015, the DEA published the final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately on the date it was published, removing naloxegol and its salts from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act.
906709_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	AstraZeneca is planning the commercial launch of MOVANTIK in the United States late in the first quarter of 2015 and MOVENTIG in the second half of 2015.
906709_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Given the significant milestones and royalty opportunity for us associated with MOVANTIK under our AstraZeneca license agreement, the level of sales achieved by AstraZeneca for MOVANTIK will have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition over the coming years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Etirinotecan pegol (also known as NKTR-102), is a next-generation topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor proprietary drug candidate, currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study as a single-agent therapy for women with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), has completed enrollment of approximately 850 women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	Patients in the BEACON study were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either single-agent etirinotecan pegol or a single agent of physician s choice.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	The primary endpoint of the BEACON study is overall survival, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival and objective tumor response rate.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	We have now achieved the necessary number of events in the BEACON study to assess the overall survival endpoint and certain other topline data.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S5	We are now conducting blinded data verification activities and currently plan to unblind and announce the top-line data from the BEACON Study in March 2015.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S6	If the BEACON study is successful and etirinotecan pegol is ultimately approved by the FDA, our current plan would be to market and sell etirinotecan pegol in the United States ourselves for the FDA approved metastatic breast cancer indication and license the commercial rights outside of the U.S. to one or more collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM7_P6_S7	As a result, the outcome of the BEACON study will have a significant impact on whether or not we invest significant capital in building and maintaining a sales and market organization for the U.S. that we currently do not have in place.
906709_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions.
906709_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	NKTR-181 has been designed to have a slow rate of entry into the brain, which is expected to reduce the attractiveness of the molecule as a target of abuse and reduce other serious central nervous system-related side effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, which are commonly associated with standard opioid therapies.
906709_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	Its potential differentiating properties are inherent to its molecular design and, as a new molecular structure, NKTR-181 s potential abuse deterrent properties do not rely on a formulation approach, a common method used with opioid drugs to reduce their ease of conversion into abusable forms of an opioid.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	In May 2012, the FDA designated NKTR-181 as a Fast Track development program for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	In June 2013, we announced results from a human abuse liability study that demonstrated that NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower drug liking scores and reduced feeling high scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	In September 2013, we announced topline results from a Phase 2 clinical study of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	In this study, NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	However, patients who were randomized to the placebo arm following a drug titration phase did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S5	This lack of a placebo rebound in the maintenance phase of the trial caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S6	In October 2014, we had an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA, which included discussions of certain considerations for the Phase 3 clinical study program.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S7	In this Phase 3 program for NKTR-181 we plan to include two separate efficacy studies in patients with chronic lower back pain, a long-term safety study, and a human abuse liability study.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S8	We enrolled the first patient in this first Phase 3 study on February 24, 2015.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S9	In this first efficacy study, we plan to enroll approximately 416 patients in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which will include a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 is given to all patients, followed by a 12 week double-blind randomized period where subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S10	The study design also includes a single interim analysis for sample size reassessment which will be conducted by an independent data monitoring committee.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S11	The primary endpoint will be change in weekly pain score in the double-blind randomized period relative to the baseline pain score and the key secondary endpoints will include percentage of responders ( 30% reduction in pain score) and patient impression of change.
906709_15_ITEM7_P8_S12	We plan to have further interactions with the FDA to finalize the study design for the other clinical studies planned for the Phase 3 program.
906709_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	Over the next two to three years, the NKTR-181 clinical development program will require a substantial investment.
906709_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	We have a collaboration with Baxter Healthcare (Baxter), to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The first drug candidate in this collaboration is BAX 855, an investigational, extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)].
906709_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	In December 2014, Baxter announced that it filed a biologic license application with the FDA for BAX 855.
906709_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	This regulatory submission was based on positive results from a prospective, global, multi-center, open-label, two-arm Phase 3 study of BAX 855 in 137 previously treated patients.
906709_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	Baxter reported that the results demonstrated that BAX 855 met its primary endpoint in the control and prevention of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis for patients who were 12 years or older.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	We also have two significant drug development programs with Bayer.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	This first is a collaboration to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and the NKTR-061 drug candidate and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	Bayer is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical study for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	Bayer is conducting this study under a Special Protocol Assessment process agreed to with the FDA.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	The second is our significant royalty rights in Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) program with Bayer that we transferred to Novartis as part of a 2008 asset divestiture transaction.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	In August 2012, Bayer initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S7	These programs represent a significant future economic opportunity for us.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S8	While the approved drugs and clinical development programs described above are key elements of the future success of our company, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier-stage drug candidate pipeline.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S9	We have several drug candidates in earlier stage clinical development or being explored in research that we are preparing to advance into the clinic in future years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S10	We also have additional proprietary preclinical and clinical drug candidates in research and development.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S11	We have an ongoing Phase 1 clinical development program for NKTR-171, a new sodium channel blocker being developed as a potential oral therapy for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S12	This year we plan to advance NKTR-214, an engineered immunostimulatory cytokine being developed for the treatment of solid tumors, into a Phase 1 clinical study.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S13	NKTR-214 is engineered to selectively activate IL-2 receptors on cytotoxic T cells that kill tumor cells, with relatively low affinity for IL-2 receptors on regulatory T cells that dampen the immune response to tumors.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S14	We are also advancing numerous other drug candidates in preclinical development in the areas of cancer immunotherapy, pain and other therapeutic indications.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S15	While we believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrate positive clinical results, receive regulatory approval in one or more major markets and achieve commercialization success, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results are extremely difficult to predict.
906709_15_ITEM7_P11_S16	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial condition and prospects, results of operation and market value.
906709_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary PEGylation reagents on a cost-plus or fixed price basis.
906709_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply PEGylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third-party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2014, we estimated that we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans.
906709_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $262.8 million in cash and investments in marketable securities, of which $25.0 million was restricted in relation to our 12.0% senior secured notes, and $151.8 million in indebtedness.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement with RPI Finance Trust.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	As is further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, license fees, milestone payments or contract research payments.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	The amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations, such as manufacturing and supply commitments, are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S6	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations.
906709_15_ITEM7_P13_S7	Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by us to determine the performance periods.
906709_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Product sales Product sales include fixed price and cost-plus manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and result from the receipt of firm purchase orders from those partners.
906709_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Product sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of decreased product demand from a number of our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	Product sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of a $9.0 million increase in product sales to one of our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	We currently expect product sales to increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to increased product demand from a number of our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products.
906709_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	as well as the completion of the royalty term for one product.
906709_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Royalty revenue decreased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the sale of our rights to receive the royalties from product sales of UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA as is further described below.
906709_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Royalties from CIMZIA and MIRCERA recognized after the royalty sale transaction took effect are presented on a separate revenue line item entitled Non-cash royalty revenue related to sale of future royalties.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	AstraZeneca is planning the commercial launch of MOVANTIK in the U.S. late in the first quarter of 2015 and MOVENTIG in the EU in the second half of 2015.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	If sales of MOVANTIK (and/or MOVENTIG ) are initiated during 2015, we expect royalty revenue received in cash will increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to royalties we expect to receive from net sales of MOVANTIK .
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S5	We expect non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA in 2015 to be consistent with 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S6	License, collaboration and other revenue License, collaboration and other revenue includes the recognition of upfront payments and milestone payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S7	The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments, the achievement of milestones, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of reimbursed research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S8	License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the recognition in 2014 of the $35.0 million and $70.0 million milestone payments received in October 2014 and November 2013, respectively, from AstraZeneca as a result of the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK in September 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S9	In addition, we recognized $8.0 million of milestones received in December 2014 related to positive results from Baxter s BAX 855 Phase 3 study.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S10	These increases in 2014 as compared to 2013 were partially offset by the recognition in 2013 of a $25.0 million payment from AstraZeneca achieved in September 2013 on the acceptance for review by the EMA of the MOVANTIK regulatory approval application filed by AstraZeneca as well as the recognition in July 2013 of the remaining $6.7 million deferred revenue balance related to our agreement with Affymax as a result of the termination of that agreement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S11	In addition, in April 2013, we recognized a $10.0 million milestone achieved upon the start of the Amikacin Inhale Phase 3 clinical trial by Bayer.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S12	License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the recognition of a $25.0 million payment from AstraZeneca achieved in September 2013, the recognition of the $10.0 million milestone achieved upon the start of the Amikacin Inhale Phase 3 clinical trial by Bayer in April 2013, and the recognition of the remaining $6.7 million deferred revenue balance related to our agreement with Affymax as noted above.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S13	In addition, we recognized $7.9 million related to the delivery of additional quantities of our proprietary PEGylation reagent to Roche in the fourth quarter of 2013.
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S14	We expect license, collaboration and other revenue in 2015 will be significantly impacted by the outcome and timing of AstraZeneca s launch of MOVANTIK as we are entitled to $140.0 million of development milestone payments due upon the commercial launches of MOVANTIK in the U.S. ($100.0 million) and in the E.U. ($40.0 million).
906709_15_ITEM7_P17_S15	If these activities occur in 2015, our license, collaboration and other revenue in 2015 will increase from 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Revenue by geography Revenue by geographic area is based on locations of our partners.
906709_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The increase in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily attributable to increased milestone and royalty revenues from our existing European based collaboration partners, including the recognition of the $105.0 million milestone payments from AstraZeneca described above.
906709_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily attributable to increased milestone and royalty revenues from our existing European based collaboration partners, including the $25.0 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca described above.
906709_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	Cost of goods sold decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the decrease in product sales of $19.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, our gross profit was negative.
906709_15_ITEM7_P20_S4	The manufacturing arrangement with one of our collaboration partners includes a fixed price for proprietary pegylation reagent sales, which is less than the fully burdened manufacturing cost for the reagent in 2014 and this situation is expected to continue in future years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P20_S5	As a result of decreased overall manufacturing volume in 2014 as compared to 2013 and given the increase in the percentage of overall sales attributable to this partner, gross profit for the year was negative.
906709_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	In addition to product sales from the reagent, we also receive royalty revenues from this collaboration.
906709_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	In 2014, the royalty revenue from the collaboration exceeded the related negative gross profit.
906709_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Cost of goods sold and product gross profit increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to the $9.4 million increase in product sales in the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	Product gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2013 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	We expect product gross margin to continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level and mix of manufacturing orders from our customers due to the predominantly fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities.
906709_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	We currently expect product gross margin to increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 as a result of the anticipated increase in product sales, as well as based on the anticipated product mix.
906709_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of clinical study costs, direct costs of outside research, materials, supplies, licenses and fees as well as personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation).
906709_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of support and facilities-related costs.
906709_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Research and development expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to reduced activities on our ongoing Phase 3 BEACON study for etirinotecan pegol as the study progresses toward completion as well as the completion of our Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-181 in the third quarter of 2013.
906709_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a charge of $11.3 million resulting from the settlement of a dispute with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York related to our collaboration with Bayer to develop inhaled amikacin.
906709_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	Research and development expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to the Phase 3 BEACON clinical study initiated in December 2011, the NKTR-181 Phase 2 clinical study initiated in July 2012 and the $11.3 million settlement charge recorded in 2013 noted above.
906709_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs.
906709_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The following table shows expenses incurred for clinical and regulatory services, clinical supplies, and preclinical study support provided by third parties as well as direct materials costs for each of our drug candidates.
906709_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):
906709_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	(1) Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1.
906709_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	(2) We partnered this program with Bayer Healthcare LLC in August 2007.
906709_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale in 2008, we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	We expect research and development expense to increase in 2015 as compared to 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	In particular, in 2015, we are commencing Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Over the next two to three years, we expect that the NKTR-181 clinical development program will require a substantial investment.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	In addition, we plan to continue to advance etirinotecan pegol in the Phase 3 BEACON study for metastatic breast cancer for which we expect the clinical study to continue through 2015.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	The clinical development costs for the BEACON clinical study will continue to be significant.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S5	We estimate that the total third party and direct material costs over the life of the BEACON study will be approximately $85.0 million, of which $72.7 million was incurred through the end of 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S6	We have also studied or have ongoing studies being conducted for etirinotecan pegol, including investigator-initiated clinical studies, in bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma, colorectal cancer, relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer, metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian cancer.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S7	We are unable to estimate the timing or costs to complete the clinical development for etirinotecan pegol across all the potential oncology indications.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S8	In addition to our NKTR-181 and etirinotecan pegol development activities, in 2015, we plan to continue to advance the development of NKTR-171 and NKTR-214.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S9	In addition, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale-up for the nebulizer devices to supply Bayer for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S10	Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer, we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for this drug candidate.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S11	We do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with MOVANTIK or the MOVANTIK fixed-dose combination products as AstraZeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S12	In addition to our drug candidates that we plan to have in clinical development during 2015 and beyond, we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build the value of our drug candidate pipeline and our business.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S13	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our PEGylation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S14	We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P26_S15	Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
906709_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	In order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development, each drug candidate must be tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies.
906709_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete.
906709_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
906709_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.
906709_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Furthermore, our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for MOVANTIK TM and Amikacin Inhale.
906709_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	In these situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control.
906709_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	General and administrative expense includes the cost of administrative staffing, business development, marketing, finance, and legal activities.
906709_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	General and administrative expense was consistent during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
906709_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	In 2015, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase compared with 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	In particular, if the BEACON study is successful and etirinotecan pegol is ultimately approved by the FDA, our current plan would be to market and sell etirinotecan pegol in the United States.
906709_15_ITEM7_P30_S4	We would expect to incur significant costs related to these activities in 2015 and future years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased marginally as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 is attributable to the interest expense recorded on the senior secured notes we issued in 2012.
906709_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million of 12% senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2017.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	of our $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% convertible subordinated notes in exchange for $42.5 million in principal amount of 12% senior secured notes.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	We repaid the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in full at maturity on September 28, 2012.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	We expect interest expense to increase slightly in 2015 compared to 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	Non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased marginally as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the decrease in 2014 of the average balance of the related liability.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The increase in non-cash interest expense on liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 is attributable to the timing of the royalty sale transaction that we completed in 2012.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S6	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S7	We impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate, which we currently estimate to be approximately 17%.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S8	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the estimated interest rate, in particular, the amount and timing of royalty payments from future net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S9	As a result, future interest rates could differ significantly and any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively.
906709_15_ITEM7_P32_S10	Unless we adjust our estimated interest rate, we expect non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties during the full year of 2015 to be consistent with 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and research and development contracts, as well as public offering and private placements of debt and equity securities.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $262.8 million in cash and investments in marketable securities, of which $25.0 million was restricted as required by our 12% senior secured notes, and $151.8 million in indebtedness.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017, but excludes our long-term liability related to the sale of future royalties.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	As is further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S4	As of December 31, 2014, we estimated that we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S5	We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates, including etirinotecan pegol, Amikacin Inhale, NKTR-181, and NKTR-171, will require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S6	However, we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S7	In the past we have received a number of significant payments from collaboration agreements and other significant transactions.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S8	In the future we expect to receive royalties from commercial sales of products such as MOVANTIK and BAX 855 (if approved) and substantial payments from future collaboration transactions if our later stage clinical development programs such as etirinotecan pegol and NKTR-181 have positive clinical outcomes.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S9	Our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, the sales levels of products for which we are entitled to royalties such as MOVANTIK , clinical program outcomes, whether, when and on what terms we are able to enter into new collaboration transactions, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities, including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.
906709_15_ITEM7_P33_S10	The availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on many factors including the success or failure of drug development programs in our pipeline, including etirinotecan pegol, BAX 855, Amikacin Inhale, NKTR-181, NKTR-171, NKTR-214, as well as other early stage development programs.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	are successful in obtaining health authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs, as well as general capital market conditions.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	We will pursue various financing alternatives, including equity and debt, as needed to continue to fund our research and development activities and to fund the expansion of our business as appropriate.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	Due to the potential for adverse developments in the credit markets in 2015 and thereafter, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	These investments are generally held to maturity, which, in accordance with our investment policy, is less than two years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S4	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S5	At December 31, 2014, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately five months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed one year.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S6	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but if such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_15_ITEM7_P34_S7	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $142.0 million, which includes $199.0 million of net operating cash uses as well as $15.0 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $72.0 million of milestones from collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized as revenue a $70.0 million payment made to us from AstraZeneca in November 2013, which was previously recorded in the line item Liability related to receipt of refundable milestone payment on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront and milestone payments received, if any, will increase in 2015 as a result of increased spending on our proprietary research and development programs, including the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical program for NKTR-181.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S3	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $38.5 million, which includes $158.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $15.2 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $135.0 million for milestones from collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S4	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $129.8 million, which includes $148.3 million of net operating cash uses, partially offset by the receipt of $18.5 million from collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S5	Net operating cash uses also include $6.7 million in interest payments on our convertible subordinated notes retired in full on September 28, 2012.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S6	Cash flows from investing activities We paid $10.0 million, $4.1 million, and $10.6 million to purchase property and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S7	We expect our capital expenditures in 2015 to increase as compared to 2014 primarily as a result of our plan to continue to build commercial manufacturing capacity for Amikacin Inhale devices.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S8	On January 28, 2014, we completed the issuance and sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering with total proceeds of approximately $117.2 million after deducting the underwriting commissions and discounts of approximately $7.5 million.
906709_15_ITEM7_P35_S9	In addition, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other costs in connection with this offering.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we made payments of $7.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, to the purchaser of these royalties because certain minimum MIRCERA net sales thresholds were not met.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	The remaining $120.5 million royalty obligation liability at December 31, 2014 will not be settled in cash.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S4	On July 11, 2012, we issued $125.0 million of senior secured notes maturing on July 15, 2017.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S5	As part of this transaction, we incurred approximately $4.5 million in issuance costs.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S6	In connection with this transaction, we retired the principal amount of $42.5 million of our $215.0 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in exchange for $42.5 million in principal amount of the senior secured notes.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S7	In addition, $25.0 million of the proceeds from the senior secured notes issuance is required to be maintained in a restricted account until July 1, 2015.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S8	On September 28, 2012, we repaid the remaining $172.4 million in principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes.
906709_15_ITEM7_P36_S9	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $47.0 million, $8.2 million, and $4.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
906709_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 8 of Item 8.
906709_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	In November 2010, we moved into our Mission Bay Facility, which includes our corporate headquarters and a research and development center.
906709_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	Under the terms of the sublease we entered into with Pfizer Inc. on September 30, 2009 for the Mission Bay Facility, we began making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	The sublease is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	(3) These amounts primarily result from capital lease obligations arising from our office space lease at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California.
906709_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	In November 2010, we ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of all of our California functions to our Mission Bay Facility.
906709_15_ITEM7_P39_S2	We have subleased all of the San Carlos Facility.
906709_15_ITEM7_P39_S3	This is further discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_15_ITEM7_P39_S4	In addition, these amounts include our obligation to purchase manufacturing equipment supporting our Amikacin Inhale program, which is further discussed in Note 4 of Item 8.
906709_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	(4) Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2014 that were issued under existing contracts.
906709_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	This amount does not represent any minimum contract termination liabilities for our existing contracts.
906709_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.
906709_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_15_ITEM7_P42_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
906709_15_ITEM7_P42_S2	Actual results may differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
906709_15_ITEM7_P42_S3	We have determined that for the periods in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of our operations.
906709_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	Revenue Recognition License, collaboration and other research revenue is recognized based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes amortization of upfront fees.
906709_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	We defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed.
906709_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The amount of upfront fees and other payments received under our license and collaboration agreements that are allocated to our continuing obligations are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each arrangement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P44_S2	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research and development activities, or manufacturing activities through the completion of clinical development or the termination or expiration of the collaboration agreement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P44_S3	Given the complexities and uncertainties of collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required by management to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	As of December 31, 2014, we had $21.4 million of deferred upfront fees related to two collaboration agreements that include research and development obligations that are being amortized over 11 to 20 years, or an average of approximately 16 years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	For our collaboration agreements, our performance obligations may span the life of the agreement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	For these, the shortest reasonable period is the end of the development period (estimated to be 4 to 8 years) and the longest period is the contractual life of the agreement, which is generally 10-12 years from the first commercial sale.
906709_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Given the statistical probability of drug development success in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, drug development programs have only a 5% to 10% probability of reaching commercial success.
906709_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	If we had determined a longer or shorter amortization period was appropriate, our annual upfront fee amortization for these agreements could be as low as $2.0 million or as high as $11.0 million as compared to the $2.1 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	As of December 31, 2014, we also had $78.4 million of deferred upfront fees related to seven license, manufacturing and supply agreements that are being amortized over periods from 3 to 14 years.
906709_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	Our performance obligations for these agreements may include technology transfer assistance and/or back-up manufacturing and supply services for a specified period of time; therefore, the time estimated to complete the performance obligations related to licenses is either specified or is much shorter than the collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	We may experience delays in the execution of technology transfer plans, which may result in a longer amortization period for applicable agreements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	Our original estimates are periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimates to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	In addition, at the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_15_ITEM7_P49_S3	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_15_ITEM7_P49_S4	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical study activities performed by third parties.
906709_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients, and completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions.
906709_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical studies ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_15_ITEM7_P50_S4	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical studies based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the studies.
906709_15_ITEM7_P50_S5	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first identified.
906709_15_ITEM7_P52_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a reduction related to prior periods of approximately $4.7 million to our research and development expenses primarily related to our Beacon Phase 3 clinical trial for etirinotecan pegol.
906709_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for each respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and common stock purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).
906709_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	We expense the estimated fair value of each award, as adjusted by the estimated historical forfeiture rate, ratably over the expected service period of the award.
906709_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_15_ITEM7_P54_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_15_ITEM7_P54_S2	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under our ESPP.
906709_15_ITEM7_P54_S3	In addition, management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_15_ITEM7_P54_S4	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.
906709_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	In addition, for awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments from sales of the CIMZIA and MIRCERA drug products marketed by UCB and Roche, respectively.
906709_15_ITEM7_P56_S1	Although we are required to make payments to the purchaser (RPI) only in certain situations, including the event of our breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in the Purchase and Sale Agreement that gives rise to a liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement, this royalty sale transaction was recorded as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that we will amortize using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P56_S2	As a result, we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the estimated interest rate.
906709_15_ITEM7_P56_S3	Our estimate of the interest rate under the agreement is based on the amount of royalty payments to be received by RPI over the life of the arrangement and payments we are required to make to RPI under the agreement.
906709_15_ITEM7_P56_S4	We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche using a combination of historical results and forecasts from market data sources.
906709_15_ITEM7_P56_S5	To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_15_ITEM7_P57_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are made in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_15_ITEM7_P57_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are higher than expected, non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense would also be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_15_ITEM7_P57_S3	If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2014 should have been one percentage point higher than our current estimate of 17%, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014 would have increased by $1.3 million.
906709_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance codified in ASC 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
906709_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606.
906709_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15).
906709_15_ITEM7_P59_S1	ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
906709_15_ITEM7_P59_S2	ASU 2014-15 is effective in 2016 with early adoption permitted.
906709_15_ITEM7_P59_S3	We do not believe the impact of adopting ASU 2014-15 on our consolidated financial statements will be significant.
906709_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_15_ITEM7_P60_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_15_ITEM7_P60_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $0.5 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S3	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $0.5 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2013.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S4	As of December 31, 2014, we held $225.5 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of five months.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S5	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S6	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S7	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we currently do not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_15_ITEM7_P61_S8	Accordingly, we believe there are no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities and have not recorded any provisions for impairment.
906709_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_15_ITEM7_P62_S2	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_15_ITEM7_P62_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.
906709_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
906709_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
906709_15_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_15_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nektar Therapeutics at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_15_ITEM8_P1_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), ( the COSO criteria ).
906709_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	Nektar Therapeutics management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
906709_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
906709_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
906709_15_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
906709_15_ITEM8_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_15_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Nektar Therapeutics maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.
906709_15_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Nektar Therapeutics and our report dated February 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	NEKTAR THERAPEUTICS NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2014 Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization We are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Francisco, California and incorporated in Delaware.
906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	We are developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms with the objective to improve the benefits of drugs for patients.
906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our research and development activities have required significant ongoing investment to date and are expected to continue to require significant investment.
906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future.
906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S4	We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreements and financing transactions.
906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S5	At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $262.8 million in cash and investments in marketable securities, of which $25.0 million was restricted in relation to our 12% senior secured notes, and $151.8 million in indebtedness.
906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S6	The indebtedness includes $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 15, 2017, but excludes our long-term liability relating to the sale of future royalties.
906709_15_ITEM8_P9_S7	As is further described in Note 7, this royalty obligation liability will not be settled in cash.
906709_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Nektar Therapeutics (India) Private Limited and Nektar Therapeutics UK, Ltd. (Nektar UK).
906709_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
906709_15_ITEM8_P10_S3	Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
906709_15_ITEM8_P10_S4	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity (deficit) section of the balance sheet.
906709_15_ITEM8_P10_S5	To date, such cumulative translation adjustments have not been significant to our consolidated financial position.
906709_15_ITEM8_P10_S6	Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recorded in operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 were not significant.
906709_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	Accounting estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain.
906709_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.
906709_15_ITEM8_P11_S3	On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to estimated selling prices of deliverables in collaboration agreements, estimated periods of performance, the net realizable value of inventory, the impairment of investments, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, contingencies, accrued clinical trial expenses, estimated interest expense from our liability related to our sale of future royalties, stock-based compensation, and ongoing litigation, among other estimates.
906709_15_ITEM8_P11_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
906709_15_ITEM8_P11_S5	These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily apparent from other sources.
906709_15_ITEM8_P11_S6	Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information and any changes in estimates will generally be reflected in the period first identified.
906709_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	Reclassifications Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	Such reclassifications do not materially impact previously reported total revenue, operating loss or net loss or total assets, liabilities or stockholders equity (deficit).
906709_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	We consider all investments in marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
906709_15_ITEM8_P13_S1	Investments in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year, or where our intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations, are classified as short-term investments.
906709_15_ITEM8_P13_S2	Investments are designated as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity (deficit) as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
906709_15_ITEM8_P13_S3	The disclosed fair value related to our cash equivalents and investments is based primarily on the reported fair values in our period-end brokerage statements, which are based on market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers and generally represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data.
906709_15_ITEM8_P13_S4	We independently validate these fair values using available market quotes and other information.
906709_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale, as well as amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, are included in interest income.
906709_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are included in other income (expense).
906709_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the third parties that hold or issue such assets.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S1	Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality and our investment policy limits investments to fixed income securities denominated and payable in U.S. dollars such as U.S. government obligations, money market instruments and funds, and corporate bonds and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S2	Accounts Receivable and Significant Customer Concentrations Our customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are located in the U.S. and Europe.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S3	Our accounts receivable balance contains billed and unbilled trade receivables from product sales and royalties, as well as time and materials based billings from collaborative research and development agreements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S4	When appropriate, we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S5	We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S6	We perform a regular review of our customers payment histories and associated credit risk.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S7	We have not experienced significant credit losses from our accounts receivable.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S8	At December 31, 2014, three different customers represented 40%, 31%, and 15%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_15_ITEM8_P16_S9	At December 31, 2013, three different customers represented 30%, 28%, and 28%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Inventory and Significant Supplier Concentrations Inventory is generally manufactured upon receipt of firm purchase orders from our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM8_P17_S1	Inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead and cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
906709_15_ITEM8_P17_S2	Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and defective or excess inventory is written down to net realizable value based on historical experience or projected usage.
906709_15_ITEM8_P17_S3	Inventory related to our research and development activities is expensed when purchased.
906709_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide raw materials, drugs and devices of appropriate quality and reliability and to meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	In certain cases, we rely on single sources of supply of one or more critical materials.
906709_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Consequently, in the event that supplies are delayed or interrupted for any reason, our ability to develop and produce our drug candidates or our ability to meet our supply obligations could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
906709_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
906709_15_ITEM8_P19_S2	Manufacturing, laboratory and other equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over estimated useful lives of three to seven years.
906709_15_ITEM8_P19_S3	Leasehold improvements and buildings recorded under capital leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
906709_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for another entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
906709_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	We are organized in one reporting unit and evaluate the goodwill for the Company as a whole.
906709_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year using an October 1 measurement date.
906709_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment and goodwill included in other non-current assets, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
906709_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	When such events occur, we determine whether there has been an impairment in value by comparing the asset s carrying value with its fair value, as measured by the anticipated undiscounted net cash flows of the asset.
906709_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	In the case of goodwill impairment, market capitalization is generally used as the measure of fair value.
906709_15_ITEM8_P21_S3	If an impairment in value exists, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
906709_15_ITEM8_P21_S4	Our revenue is derived from our arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaboration partners and may result from one or more of the following: upfront and license fees, payments for contract research and development, milestone payments, manufacturing and supply payments, and royalties.
906709_15_ITEM8_P21_S5	Our performance obligations under our collaborations may include licensing our intellectual property, manufacturing and supply obligations, and research and development obligations.
906709_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	In order to account for the multiple-element arrangements, the Company identifies the deliverables included within the arrangement and evaluates which deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
906709_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment, and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver services, a right or license to use an asset, or another performance obligation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Revenue is recognized separately for each identified unit of accounting when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met: there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	At the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate all consideration received under multiple-element arrangements to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P23_S3	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material change in our estimates would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Product sales Product sales are primarily derived from fixed price and cost-plus manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	We have not experienced any significant returns from our customers.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	Generally, we are entitled to royalties from our collaboration partners based on the net sales of their approved drugs that are marketed and sold in one or more countries where we hold royalty rights.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	We recognize royalty revenue when the cash is received or when the royalty amount to be received is estimable and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S4	With respect to the non-cash royalties related to sale of future royalties described at Note 7, revenue is recognized when estimable, otherwise, revenue is recognized during the period in which the related royalty report is received, which generally occurs in the quarter after the applicable product sales are made.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S5	License, collaboration and other The amount of upfront fees and other payments received by us in license and collaboration arrangements that are allocated to continuing performance obligations, such as manufacturing and supply obligations, are deferred and generally recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each respective arrangement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S6	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research activities, clinical development activities, and manufacturing activities from development through the commercialization of the product.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S7	Given the uncertainties of these collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the performance period and this estimate is periodically re-evaluated.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S8	Contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved, which we believe is consistent with the substance of our performance under our various license and collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S9	A milestone is defined as an event (i) that can only be achieved based in whole or in part either on the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due to the entity.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S10	A milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent with our performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance, relates solely to our past performance, and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S11	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners provide for payments to us upon the achievement of development milestones, such as the completion of clinical trials or regulatory submissions, approvals by health authorities, and commercial launches of drugs.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S12	Given the challenges inherent in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for drug products and in achieving commercial launches, there was substantial uncertainty whether any such milestones would be achieved at the time of execution of these licensing and collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S13	In addition, we evaluated whether the development milestones meet the remaining criteria to be considered substantive.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S14	As a result of our analysis, we consider our remaining development milestones under all of our license and collaboration agreements to be substantive and, accordingly, we expect to recognize as revenue future payments received from such milestones only if and as each milestone is achieved.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S15	Our license and collaboration agreements with certain partners also provide for contingent payments to us based solely upon the performance of the respective partner.
906709_15_ITEM8_P24_S16	For such contingent amounts we expect to recognize the payments as revenue when earned under the applicable contract, which is generally upon completion of performance by the respective partner, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners also provide for payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales volumes of approved drugs.
906709_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	We consider these payments to be similar to royalty payments and we will recognize such sales-based payments upon achievement of such sales volumes, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs We recognize costs related to shipping and handling of product to customers in cost of goods sold.
906709_15_ITEM8_P26_S1	Research and Development Expense Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits and other operating costs such as outside services, supplies and allocated overhead costs.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	We perform research and development for our proprietary drug candidates and technology development and for certain third parties under collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	For our proprietary drug candidates and our internal technology development programs, we invest our own funds without reimbursement from a third party.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical trial activities performed by third parties.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S3	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S4	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients, and completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S5	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical trials ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S6	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical trials based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the trials.
906709_15_ITEM8_P27_S7	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_15_ITEM8_P29_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first identified.
906709_15_ITEM8_P29_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a reduction related to prior periods of approximately $4.7 million to our research and development expenses primarily related to our Beacon Phase 3 clinical trial for etirinotecan pegol.
906709_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock option grants and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), through which employees may purchase our common stock at a discount to the market price.
906709_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of the option on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and the estimated fair value of common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination.
906709_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	We expense the value of the portion of the option or award that is ultimately expected to vest based on the historical forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
906709_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	For awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP is recognized over the respective six-month purchase period.
906709_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Expense amounts are recorded in cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense based on the function of the applicable employee.
906709_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Stock-based compensation charges are non-cash charges and as such have no impact on our reported cash flows.
906709_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
906709_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	For all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the net loss available to common stockholders is equal to the reported net loss.
906709_15_ITEM8_P37_S2	Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same due to our historical net losses and the requirement to exclude potentially dilutive securities which would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.
906709_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, potentially dilutive securities consisted of common shares underlying outstanding stock options and there were weighted average outstanding stock options of 21.9 million, 20.7 million and 18.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
906709_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method.
906709_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
906709_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
906709_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.
906709_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	We utilize a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions.
906709_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
906709_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Comprehensive loss Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity (deficit) from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.
906709_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Our other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net loss, gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of the assets and liabilities of our India and UK subsidiaries, and unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities.
906709_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.
906709_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606.
906709_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15).
906709_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	ASU 2014-15 requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
906709_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	ASU 2014-15 is effective in 2016 with early adoption permitted.
906709_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	We do not believe the impact of adopting ASU 2014-15 on our consolidated financial statements will be significant.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Note 2 Cash and Investments in Marketable Securities Cash and investments in marketable securities, including cash equivalents and restricted cash, are as follows (in thousands): We invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in securities with maturities of two years or less and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S3	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, all of our investments had contractual maturities of one year or less and were classified as short-term.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S4	Gross unrealized gains and losses were not significant at either December 31, 2014 or 2013.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we sold available-for-sale securities totaling $21.7 million, $2.9 million and $5.4 million respectively, and realized gains and losses were not significant in any of those periods.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S6	Restricted cash of $25.0 million is required to be maintained in a separate account until July 1, 2015 under the terms of our 12% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S7	Upon release of this restriction on July 1, 2015, a covenant of the senior secured notes requires that the aggregate balance of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at the end of any two consecutive fiscal quarters may not be less than $25.0 million, subject to certain conditions (see Note 5).
906709_15_ITEM8_P45_S8	Our portfolio of cash and investments in marketable securities includes (in thousands):
906709_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
906709_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
906709_15_ITEM8_P46_S2	Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

906709_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Note 7 Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties On February 24, 2012, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with RPI Finance Trust (RPI), an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, pursuant to which we sold, and RPI purchased, our right to receive royalty payments (the Royalty Entitlement) arising from the worldwide net sales, from and after January 1, 2012, of (a) CIMZIA , under Nektar s license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB), and (b) MIRCERA , under Nektar s license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together referred to as Roche).
906709_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	We received aggregate cash proceeds of $124.0 million for the Royalty Entitlement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs, which will be amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	products, as a result of our ongoing manufacturing and supply obligations related to the generation of these royalties, we will continue to account for these royalties as revenue and recorded the $124.0 million in proceeds from this transaction as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that will be amortized using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	The following table shows the activity within the liability account during the year ended December 31, 2014 and for the period from the inception of the royalty transaction on February 24, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in March 2014 and March 2013, we were required to pay RPI $7.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, as a result of worldwide net sales of MIRCERA for the 12 month periods ended on December 31, 2013 and 2012 not reaching certain minimum thresholds.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S3	As of December 31, 2014, we do not expect to make any further payments related to the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S4	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to RPI starting with royalties arising from product sales in the first quarter of 2012, we will continue to recognize revenue for these royalties.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $21.9 million, $22.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively, in non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S6	As royalties are remitted to RPI from Roche and UCB, the balance of the Royalty Obligation will be effectively repaid over the life of the agreement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S7	In order to determine the amortization of the Royalty Obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by RPI and payments we are required to make to RPI as noted above over the life of the agreement.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S8	The sum of these amounts less the $124.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S9	Since inception, our estimate of this total interest expense resulted in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 17%.
906709_15_ITEM8_P61_S10	We periodically assess the estimated royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche and to the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates, or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are made in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are more than expected, the non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense recorded by us would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	indemnification obligations that are customary for a transaction of this nature.
906709_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	To our knowledge, we are currently in compliance with these provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, however, if we were to breach our obligations, we could be required to pay damages to RPI that are not limited to the purchase price we received in the sale transaction.
906709_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	We have third party licenses that require us to pay royalties based on our sales of certain products and/or on our recognition of royalty revenue under certain of our collaboration agreements.
906709_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	Royalty expense, which is reflected in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was approximately $3.4 million, $4.1 million, and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.
906709_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	The overall maximum amount of these obligations is based upon sales of the applicable products by our collaboration partners and cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	In the normal course of business, we enter into various firm purchase commitments related to contract manufacturing, clinical development and certain other items.
906709_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	As of December 31, 2014, these commitments were approximately $16.9 million, all of which are expected to be paid in 2015.
906709_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
906709_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
906709_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	Such provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
906709_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	If any unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or on our cash flows and liquidity.
906709_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	Foreign Operations We operate in a number of foreign countries.
906709_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous local laws and regulations that can result in claims made by foreign government agencies or other third parties that are often difficult to predict even after the application of good faith compliance efforts.
906709_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	During the course of our normal operating activities, we have agreed to certain contingent indemnification obligations as further described below.
906709_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	The term of our indemnification obligations is generally perpetual.
906709_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	There is generally no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_15_ITEM8_P70_S3	To date, we have not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims based on our indemnification obligations.
906709_15_ITEM8_P70_S4	If any of our indemnification obligations is triggered, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Because the aggregate amount of any potential indemnification obligation is not a stated amount, the overall maximum amount of any such obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	No liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014 or 2013.
906709_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	indemnify and hold harmless our partners from and against third party liabilities arising out of the agreement, including product liability (with respect to our activities) and infringement of intellectual property to the extent the intellectual property is developed by us and licensed to our partners.
906709_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	As part of the sale of our royalty interest in the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, we and RPI made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by indemnity obligations.
906709_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	Additionally, as part of our pulmonary asset sale to Novartis in 2008, we and Novartis made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by an indemnity obligation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P72_S3	In the event it is determined that we breached certain of the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements made by us in any such agreements, we could incur substantial indemnification liabilities depending on the timing, nature, and amount of any such claims.
906709_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Indemnification of Underwriters and Initial Purchasers of our Securities In connection with our sale of equity and senior secured debt securities, we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our underwriters or initial purchasers, as applicable, as well as certain related parties from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

906709_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, we have insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
906709_15_ITEM8_P73_S3	Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1,500,000 per incident for merger and acquisition related claims, $1,000,000 per incident for securities related claims and $500,000 per incident for non-securities related claims retention deductible per our insurance policy.
906709_15_ITEM8_P73_S4	However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.

906709_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	The valuation allowance includes approximately $35.6 million of income tax benefit at both December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 related to stock-based compensation and exercises prior to the implementation of the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation that will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized.
906709_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in India are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly, no deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
906709_15_ITEM8_P122_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income tax.
906709_15_ITEM8_P122_S2	As of December 31, 2014, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $3.9 million of such earnings.
906709_15_ITEM8_P122_S3	Any incremental tax liability would be insignificant due to foreign tax credits that would be realized upon distribution.
906709_15_ITEM8_P122_S4	As of December 31, 2014, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,131.8 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2018.
906709_15_ITEM8_P122_S5	As of December 31, 2014, we had a total state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $709.2 million, of which approximately $124.6 million does not meet the more likely than not standard and has not been included in our deferred tax assets.
906709_15_ITEM8_P122_S6	Our state operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015.
906709_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
906709_15_ITEM8_P123_S1	We have federal research credits of approximately $40.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2019 and state research credits of approximately $22.6 million which have no expiration date.
906709_15_ITEM8_P123_S2	We have federal orphan drug credits of $17.7 million which will begin to expire in 2026.
906709_15_ITEM8_P123_S3	These tax credits are subject to the same limitations discussed above.
906709_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits We have incurred net operating losses since inception.
906709_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
906709_15_ITEM8_P124_S2	If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our effective tax rate may be reduced.
906709_15_ITEM8_P124_S3	We currently have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
906709_15_ITEM8_P124_S4	Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.
906709_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Alabama, and India.
906709_15_ITEM8_P125_S1	Because of net operating losses and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our domestic tax years remain open and subject to examination.
906709_15_ITEM8_P125_S2	We are currently under examination in India for the fiscal years ending 2009 through 2014.
906709_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	We have the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
906709_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
906709_15_ITEM8_P127_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, no significant interest or penalties were recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	We operate in one business segment which focuses on applying our technology platforms to improve the performance of established and novel medicines.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S1	We operate in one segment because our business offerings have similar economics and other characteristics, including the nature of products and manufacturing processes, types of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S2	We are comprehensively managed as one business segment by our Chief Executive Officer and his management team.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S3	Within our one business segment we have two components, PEGylation technology and pulmonary technology.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S4	Our revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S5	AstraZeneca, UCB and Roche represented 52%, 16%, and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S6	Revenue from Roche, UCB, AstraZeneca and Bayer represented 28%, 21%, 17% and 10% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S7	Revenue from UCB, Roche and Affymax represented 30%, 23% and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S8	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_15_ITEM8_P128_S9	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	At December 31, 2014, $63.7 million, or approximately 90%, of the net book value of our property and equipment was located in the United States and $6.7 million, or approximately 10%, was located in India.
906709_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	December 31, 2013, $57.3 million, or approximately 88%, of the net book value of our property and equipment was located in the United States and $7.7 million, or approximately 12%, was located in India.
906709_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data.
906709_15_ITEM8_P131_S1	In our opinion, the unaudited information set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth herein.
906709_15_ITEM8_P132_S0	We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results and expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
906709_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
906709_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	Such reclassifications have not materially impacted previously reported total revenues, operating loss or net loss.
906709_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	All data is in thousands except per share information.

906709_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
906709_15_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst Young, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2014, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P4_S4	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

906709_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, and immunology.
906709_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and protein biologic drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule.
906709_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs.
906709_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK TM (previously referred to as naloxegol and NKTR-118), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca).
906709_16_ITEM1_P2_S3	MOVANTIK TM is an oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist (PAMORA), approved in both the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, a common side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines.
906709_16_ITEM1_P2_S4	MOVANTIK was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_16_ITEM1_P2_S5	On March 31, 2015, AstraZeneca announced that it launched MOVANTIK TM in the United States, as a result of which we received a $100 million commercial launch milestone on March 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM1_P2_S6	In August 2015, we received an additional $40.0 million payment triggered by the first commercial sale of MOVENTIG by AstraZeneca in Germany.
906709_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	We have a collaboration with certain subsidiaries of Baxalta Incorporated (Baxalta), formerly Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) before the separation of Baxalta from Baxter in July 2015, to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new longer-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	Under this collaboration, we worked with Baxter to develop ADYNOVATE TM (previously referred to as BAX 855), an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for Hemophilia A based on ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)].
906709_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	In November 2015, ADYNOVATE TM was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. Baxalta announced the launch and first shipments of ADYNOVATE TM in the U.S. on November 30, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM1_P3_S3	In December 2015, Baxalta announced positive Phase 3 study results of ADYNOVATE TM in patients younger than 12 years of age with severe Hemophilia A. With the study results, Baxalta announced that it plans to file for marketing authorization in the European Union and aims to file for a pediatric indication in the U.S. in early 2016.
906709_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	ADYNOVATE TM is currently under regulatory review in Japan, Canada and Switzerland.
906709_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions and is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.
906709_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	We enrolled the first patient in the first Phase 3 efficacy study in February 2015 and the study continues to enroll patients.
906709_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	In this study, we are randomizing patients with chronic low back pain in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which will include a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 is given to all patients, followed by a 12 week double-blind randomized period where subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	The NKTR-181 Phase 3 study design includes a single interim sample size assessment to be conducted by an independent analysis center (IAC) after approximately fifty percent of the initially planned 416 patients completed the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	The protocol of the NKTR-181 study defined only two possible outcomes for this pre-planned blinded interim sample size assessment: (1) if the conditional powering at the midpoint of the trial fell between 50-85%, the sample size was to be increased by about 200 patients; or (2) if the conditional powering fell below 50%, or above 85%, the sample size was not to be changed.
906709_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	The IAC s determination is nondiscretionary and was based upon our determination of pre-defined acceptable power to detect a statistically significant difference between NKTR-181 and placebo based on the primary efficacy endpoint.
906709_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	On February 29, 2016, the IAC instructed Nektar to increase the sample size by about 200 patients.
906709_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	In December 2015, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical study for NKTR-214, which is our engineered immunostimulatory CD122-biased cytokine designed to preferentially activate the beta and gamma sub-units of the IL-2 receptor in orde r to proliferate tumor-killing T cells within the body (CD8-positive effector T cells and natural killer T cells) without stimulating regulatory T cells (CD4-positive T cells).
906709_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	The study is being conducted initially at two primary investigator sites: the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Yale Cancer Center.
906709_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	The dose-escalation stage of the Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate safety, efficacy, and define the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 in approximately 20 patients with solid tu mors.
906709_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	In addition to a determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study will assess preliminary anti-tumor activity, includi ng objective response rate .
906709_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	The immunologic effect of NKTR-214 on tumor-infiltrati ng lymphocytes and other immune infiltrating cells in both blood and tumor tissue will also be assessed.
906709_16_ITEM1_P8_S3	Following the dose-escalation stage of the study, dose expansion cohorts are planned to evaluate NKTR-214 in specific tumor types, which may include melanoma, renal cell carcinoma an d non-small cell lung cancer .
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	NKTR-102 (also known as etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	On March 17, 2015, we announced topline data from a Phase 3 clinical study for NKTR-102, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	The BEACON study compared NKTR-102 to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	In a topline analysis of 852 patients from the trial, NKTR-102 provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival (OS) over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving NKTR-102 compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S4	Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the NKTR-102 group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S5	Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S6	We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroup populations patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S7	We are currently exploring various future regulatory and development paths forward for NKTR-102 with the EU and U.S. regulatory authorities.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S8	In Europe, we have met with the National Authorities in Sweden (MPA) and the United Kingdom (MHRA) to discuss the BEACON data.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S9	We also met the European Medicines Agency to discuss filing a marketing authorization application (MAA).
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S10	Based on the outcome of these meetings, we believe that there is a path forward to file an MAA for conditional approval of NKTR-102 for patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S11	In connection with any MAA filing, we would be required to start a confirmatory trial in conjunction with the MAA review.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S12	In the United States, we met with the FDA and the Oncology Division indicated that we would not be able to use the BEACON data to support an accelerated approval for a new drug application (NDA).
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S13	However, the FDA staff also indicated that positive results from a completed confirmatory trial for the MAA could support an NDA filing.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S14	We are currently evaluating next steps for this program.
906709_16_ITEM1_P9_S15	At this time, we do not plan to advance development of NKTR-102 without a collaboration partner.
906709_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We have a collaboration with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer) to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	We originally developed the NKTR-061 drug candidate and the associated liquid aerosol inhalation platform and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer to advance the drug candidate into further clinical development and potential commercialization.
906709_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	Bayer is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical program for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	Bayer is conducting this study under a Special Protocol Assessment process agreed to with the FDA.
906709_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	We have a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Ophthotech Corporation for Fovista , an anti-platelet-derived growth factor (anti-PDGF) agent , currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration.

906709_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	We have a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma for dapirolizumab pegol, a monovalent pegylated Fab antibody fragment against the CD40 ligand (CD40L), being developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for which the candidate is entering Phase 2 development with UCB partner Biogen.
906709_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with other leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen Inc., Allergan, Inc., Merck Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche).
906709_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	A total of ten products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or EU.
906709_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale and transfer of certain pulmonary technology rights, certain pulmonary collaboration agreements and approximately 140 dedicated pulmonary personnel and operations to Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis).
906709_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	We retai ned all of our rights to Amikacin Inhale and our right to receive royalties on net sales of the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG that we transferred to Novartis as part of the transa ction.
906709_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	In August 2012, Bayer initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	The two placebo-controlled trials, RESPIRE-1 and RESPIRE-2, are enrolling up to 600 pati ents and will evaluate Cipro DPI as a chronic, intermittent therapy over a period of 48 weeks.
906709_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	We were incorporated in California in 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998.
906709_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	We maintain our executive offices at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South, San Francisco, California 94158, and our main telephone number is (415) 482-5300.

906709_16_ITEM1_P14_S4	Our Technology Platform As a leader in the PEGylation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer conjugate chemistries and polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules including many classes of drugs targeting numerous disease areas.
906709_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Roche s PEGASYS (PEG-interferon alfa-2a).
906709_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body.
906709_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties.
906709_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics.
906709_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	These techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology.
906709_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in PEGylation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
906709_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	Both our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
906709_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates Our customized approach for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	An example of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is MOVANTIK TM , an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that is approved in the United States and European Union.
906709_16_ITEM1_P20_S4	An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that is currently in Phase 3 development.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	We are using this approach with our lead oncolytic drug candidate, NKTR-102, a next-generation topoisomerase I-inhibitor currently in the Phase 3 BEACON clinical study for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S4	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S5	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S6	Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S7	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have expanded to include a new approach with biologics, in particular cytokines, which utilizes the polymer as a means to bias action to a certain receptor or receptor sub-type.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S8	In addition, a cytokine s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_16_ITEM1_P21_S9	An example of this is NKTR-214, which is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine with an every two or every three-week dosing schedule.
906709_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and EU.
906709_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	To support this strategy, we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of existing drugs and drug candidates as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S4	Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S5	We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S6	Enter into Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S7	When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P26_S8	The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.

906709_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Amgen Inc. prevailed in a patent lawsuit against F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche) and as a result of this legal ruling Roche was prevented from marketing MIRCERA in the U.S. until July 2014.
906709_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with Roche is terminated or expires.
906709_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	This drug candidate was developed using our proprietary pulmonary delivery technology that was transferred by us to Novartis in an asset sale transaction that closed on December 31, 2008.
906709_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	As part of the transaction, Novartis assumed our rights and obligations for Cipro DPI (formerly known as Cipro Inhale) under our agreements with Bayer Schering Pharma AG; however, we maintained the rights to receive royalties on commercial sales of Cipro DPI if the drug candidate is approved.
906709_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	With respect to all of our collaboration and license agreements with third parties, please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell MOVANTIK TM and MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination products.
906709_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	MOVANTIK TM was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	MOVANTIK TM is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist being investigated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications.
906709_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors.
906709_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur.
906709_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
906709_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	On September 16, 2014, the FDA approved MOVANTIK TM as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	On December 9, 2014, the European Commission, or EC, granted Marketing Authorisation to MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the European Union, or EU) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the EU for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).
906709_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	The EC s approval applies to all 28 EU member countries plus Iceland and Norway.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	On January 23, 2015, the Drug Enforcement Administration published the final rule in the Federal Register, effective immediately on the date it was published, removing naloxegol and its salts from the schedules of the Controlled Substances Act.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	AstraZeneca launched the commercial sales of MOVANTIK TM in the United States in March 2015 and MOVENTIG in Germany, the first EU member country, in August 2015.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	Under the terms of our license agreement, AstraZeneca made an initial license payment of $125.0 million to us and has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for MOVANTIK TM and MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination products.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	We received milestone payments of $70.0 million and $25.0 million upon the acceptance of regulatory approval applications of MOVANTIK TM by the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively, in 2013.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	We received an additional milestone payment of $35.0 million upon the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK TM in 2014 and a total of $140.0 million upon commercial launches in 2015, including $100.0 million for MOVANTIK TM in the U.S. and $40.0 million for MOVENTIG in Germany.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S5	We are also entitled to up to $375.0 million in sales milestones for MOVANTIK TM if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S6	For the MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination products, we are also eligible to receive significant development milestones as well as significant sales milestone payments if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S7	For both MOVANTIK TM and the fixed-dose combination products, we are also entitled to significant double-digit royalty payments starting at 20% of net sales in the U.S. and 18% of net sales in the EU and rest of world, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales.
906709_16_ITEM1_P49_S8	Our right to receive royalties (subject to certain adjustments) in any particular country will expire upon the later of (a) a specified period of time after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or (b) the expiration of patent rights in that particular country.
906709_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine MOVANTIK TM with opioids.
906709_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	There are a number of patents relevant to Movantik TM , some of which are listed in the FDA s Orange Book.
906709_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	The Orange Book currently lists six patents for Movantik TM .
906709_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	Four patents (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 7,056,500, 7,662,365, 7,786,133 and 9,012,469) are composition of matter patents -- one of which has a patent expiry extending into 2032.
906709_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	In addition, two patents (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 8,067,431 and 8,617,530) are directed to methods of treatment .
906709_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	ADYNOVATE TM (previously referred to as BAX 855, PEGylated rFVIII) ADYNOVATE TM is an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for Hemophilia A based on ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)].
906709_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	In December 2014, Baxalta announced that it filed a biologic license application with the FDA for ADYNOVATE TM .
906709_16_ITEM1_P52_S2	This regulatory submission was based on positive results from a prospective, global, multi-center, open-label, two-arm Phase 3 study of ADYNOVATE TM (previously referred to as BAX 855) in 137 previously treated patients.
906709_16_ITEM1_P52_S3	Baxalta reported that the results demonstrated that ADYNOVATE TM met its primary endpoint in the control and prevention of bleeding episodes and routine prophylaxis for patients who were 12 years or older.
906709_16_ITEM1_P52_S4	In November 2015, ADYNOVATE TM was approved by the FDA for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. On November 30, 2015, Baxalta announced that it had initiated sales of ADYNOVATE TM in the U.S. ADYNOVATE TM is currently under regulatory review in Japan, Canada and Switzerland.
906709_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII (FVIII) deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein.
906709_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, hemophilia occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 live births.
906709_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	A 2010 Datamonitor report calculates that there are approximately 78,000 patients reported to have Hemophilia A worldwide.
906709_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	In 2014, according to the Evaluate Group, sales of FVIII replacement products exceeded $6 billion globally.
906709_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	There are a number of patents relevant to Adynovate TM .
906709_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Among other patents, U.S. Patent Nos.
906709_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	7,199,223 and 8,247,536 provide composition of matter coverage through February 26, 2024, for this important drug (although extensions of patent term may be available under various regulatory mechanisms).
906709_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	Additional patents owned by Nektar Therapeutics provide further layers of patent coverage for Adynovate TM .
906709_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	NKTR-181 is an orally-available novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule in development as a long-acting analgesic to treat chronic pain.
906709_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	NKTR-181 is designed with the objective to address the abuse liability and serious central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with current opioid therapies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P56_S2	NKTR-181 was created using Nektar s proprietary polymer conjugate technology, which provides it with a long-acting profile and slows its entry into the CNS.
906709_16_ITEM1_P56_S3	NKTR-181 s abuse deterrent properties are inherent to its novel molecular structure and do not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid.
906709_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	In May 2012, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the NKTR-181 development program.
906709_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	In June 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_16_ITEM1_P57_S2	The Phase 2 clinical study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, enriched enrollment study design.
906709_16_ITEM1_P57_S3	The study enrolled 295 opioid-na ve patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were not getting adequate pain relief from their current non-opioid pain medication.
906709_16_ITEM1_P57_S4	Patients who qualified during the baseline period entered a titration phase, during which they were titrated on NKTR-181 tablets administered orally twice-daily until a dose was reached that provided a reduction of at least 20% in the patient s pain score as compared to the patient s own baseline.
906709_16_ITEM1_P57_S5	Patients that achieved this level of analgesia were then randomized on a 1:1 basis to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive placebo for up to 25 days.
906709_16_ITEM1_P57_S6	The primary endpoint of the study was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181.
906709_16_ITEM1_P58_S1	In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower "drug liking" scores and reduced "feeling high" scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	On June 19, 2013, we presented data from the HAL study at the 2013 Annual Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence in San Diego, California.
906709_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	On September 26, 2013, we announced results from this Phase 2 efficacy study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only 9 patients (representing 3% of the patient population) were unable to achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181.
906709_16_ITEM1_P59_S3	A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P59_S4	NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study with patients continuing to show a reduction in pain scores throughout the randomized phase of the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P59_S5	However, patients who were randomized to placebo did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P59_S6	This unusual lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint in the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	In October 2014, we engaged in an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA , which included discuss ions of the design of the Phase 3 clinical study program .
906709_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	In this Phase 3 program for NKTR-181 we plan to include two separate efficacy studies in patients with chronic lower back pain, a long-term safety study, and a human abuse liability study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	We enrolled the first patient in this first Phase 3 study in February 2015 .
906709_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	In this first efficacy study, we plan to enroll approximately 416 patients in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which will include a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period w here NKTR-181 is given to all patients, followed by a 12 week double-blind randomized period where subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	As described above, on February 29, 2016 the independent analysis center ( IAC ) instructed us to increase the sample size by about 200 patients.
906709_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	The primary endpoint is a change in weekly pain score in the double-blind randomized period relative to the baseline pain score and the key secondary endpoints include percentage of re sponders ( 30% reduction in pain score) and patient impression of change.
906709_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	According to a 2011 report from the National Academy of Sciences, chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis, back pain and cancer pain, affect at least 100 million adults in the U.S. annually and contribute to over $300 billion a year in lost productivity.
906709_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain.
906709_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	However, opioids cause significant problems for physicians and patients because of their serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation, as well as the risks they pose for addiction, abuse, misuse, and diversion.
906709_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	The FDA has cited prescription opioid analgesics as being at the center of a major public health crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death.
906709_16_ITEM1_P63_S3	According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine 2016 report, there are 1.9 million Americans which have a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers.
906709_16_ITEM1_P63_S4	This same report attributes 18,893 overdose deaths in 2015 were related to prescription pain relievers.
906709_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	We are developing NKTR-102, a next generation topoisomerase I (topo I) inhibitor which was designed using our PEGylation technology.
906709_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	NKTR-102 is a novel macromolecular chemotherapeutic designed to enhance the anti-cancer effects of topo I inhibition while minimizing its toxicities.
906709_16_ITEM1_P64_S2	Unlike irinotecan, which is a first generation topo I inhibitor that exhibits a high initial peak concentration and short half-life, NKTR-102 s pro-drug design results in a lower initial peak concentration of active topo I inhibitor in the blood.
906709_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	The large NKTR-102 molecule is inactive when administered.
906709_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	Over time, the body s natural enzymatic processes slowly metabolize the linkers within the molecule, continuously freeing active drug that then can work to stop tumor cell division through topo I inhibition.
906709_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	In preclinical models, NKTR-102 achieved a 300-fold increase in tumor concentration as compared to irinotecan.
906709_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	Because NKTR-102 is a large molecule, based on preclinical studies we believe that it may penetrate the leaky vasculature within the tumor environment more readily than normal vasculature, concentrating and trapping NKTR-102 in tumor tissue.
906709_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	Clinical studies have shown that NKTR-102 has an extended pharmacokinetic profile and remains in circulation throughout the entire chemotherapy cycle, providing sustained exposure to topo I inhibition.
906709_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	NKTR-102 is currently being evaluated as a single-agent therapy (145 mg/m2 every 21 days) in a Phase 3 open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical study in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	This Phase 3 clinical study, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), enrolled approximately 850 patients with metastatic breast cancer who have had prior treatment with anthracycline, taxane and capecitabine in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
906709_16_ITEM1_P68_S2	We completed enrollment in the BEACON study in late July 2013.
906709_16_ITEM1_P68_S3	This study randomized patients on a 1:1 basis to receive single-agent NKTR-102 or a single agent chosen from a defined set of physician s choice alternatives.
906709_16_ITEM1_P68_S4	The physician s choice single agents include the following: ixabepilone, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, eribulin, or a taxane.
906709_16_ITEM1_P68_S5	Randomization was stratified by geographic region, prior treatment with eribulin and whether or not the patient had triple negative breast cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	On March 17, 2015, we announced topline data from the BEACON Phase 3 clinical study for NKTR-102.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	In a topline analysis of 852 patients from the trial, NKTR-102 provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival (OS) over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving NKTR-102 compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the NKTR-102 group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S3	Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S4	We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroups patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S5	We are currently exploring various future regulatory paths forward for NKTR-102 with the EU and U.S. regulatory authorities.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S6	In Europe, we have met with the National Authorities in Sweden (MPA) and the United Kingdom (MHRA) to discuss the BEACON data.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S7	We also met with the EMA to discuss filing an MAA.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S8	Based on the outcome of these meetings, we believe that there is a path forward to file an MAA for conditional approval of NKTR-102 for patients with advanced breast cancer having brain metastases.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S9	In connection with any MAA filing, the EMA has informed us that we would be required to start a confirmatory trial in conjunction with the MAA review.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S10	In the United States, we met with the FDA and the Oncology Division indicated that we would not be able to use the BEACON data to support an accelerated approval for an NDA.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S11	However, the FDA staff also indicated that positive results from a completed confirmatory trial for the MAA could also support an NDA filing.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S12	We are currently evaluating next steps for this program.
906709_16_ITEM1_P69_S13	At this time, we do not plan to advance development of NKTR-102 without a collaboration partner.
906709_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year.
906709_16_ITEM1_P70_S1	The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman s life is a little less than one in eight (12%).
906709_16_ITEM1_P70_S2	In 2016, the American Cancer Society estima tes there will be 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the U.S. and about 40,450 women will die from breast cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease.
906709_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	There are currently no FDA-approved topoi somerase I inhibitors indicated to treat breast cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	We have also conducted clinical studies for NKTR-102 in other solid tumor settings.
906709_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	In 2013, we completed a Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-102 in approximately 170 patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	We also initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of NKTR-102 monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene.
906709_16_ITEM1_P72_S4	The Phase 2 clinical study was designed to enroll 174 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P72_S5	In February 2014, we decided to close enrollment in this study after 80 patients were randomized due to challenges in recruiting new patients because the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the U.S. or EU.
906709_16_ITEM1_P72_S6	We also conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study which enrolled 26 patients to evaluate NKTR-102 in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers.
906709_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen.
906709_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	On January 18, 2014, we presented data from this study at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, California.
906709_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	In addition to the clinical study of NKTR-102 being conducted by us, we have also provided support for four investigator-initiated Phase 2 studies being conducted for NKTR-102.
906709_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	On August 7, 2012, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of NKTR-102 in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma being conducted at the Stanford Cancer Institute.
906709_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	In May 2013, the study completed enrollment of 20 patients with high-grade glioma who had received a median of three prior lines of therapy before enrolling in the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	A separate investigator-initiated clinical study is also being conducted at Stanford to evaluate NKTR-102 in patients with brain metastasis from primary lung cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P74_S4	On February 5, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of NKTR-102 in patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer being conducted at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
906709_16_ITEM1_P74_S5	On October 24, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of NKTR-102 in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.

906709_16_ITEM1_P75_S8	We share a portion of these royalties with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York under a license agreement.
906709_16_ITEM1_P75_S9	The agreement expires in relation to a particular country upon the expiration of all royalty and payment obligations between the parties related to such country.
906709_16_ITEM1_P75_S10	Subject to termination fee payment obligations in certain circumstances, Bayer also has the right to terminate the agreement for convenience.
906709_16_ITEM1_P75_S11	In addition, the agreement may also be terminated by either party for certain product safety concerns, the product s failure to meet certain minimum commercial profile requirements or uncured material breaches by the other party.
906709_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	Gram-negative pneumonias are often the result of complications of other patient conditions or surgeries.
906709_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	Gram-negative pneumonias carry a mortality risk that can exceed 50% in mechanically-ventilated patients and accounts for a substantial proportion of the pneumonias in intensive care units today.
906709_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Amikacin Inhale is designed to be an adjunctive therapy to the current antibiotic therapies administered intravenously as standard of care.
906709_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	The aerosol generator within the nebulizer for Amikacin Inhale delivers a fine aerosol of the antimicrobial agent directly to the site of infection in the lungs.

906709_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	negative pneumonia receiving s tandard of care intravenous antibiotics.
906709_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	The global INHALE development program is comprised of two prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, large multi-center global programs involving centers in North America, South America, Europe, Jap an, Australia and Asia.
906709_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	The INHALE development program is being conducted by Bayer under a Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the FDA that is intended to support the submission of an NDA if the INHALE clinical studies are successful.
906709_16_ITEM1_P80_S2	In November 2014, the FDA granted qualified infectious disease product (QIDP) designation to Amikacin Inhale.
906709_16_ITEM1_P80_S3	Antimicrobial drugs designed to treat serious and life-threatening infections, designated as QIDP, are eligible for fast-track designation, priority review by FDA and a five-year extension of market exclusivity.
906709_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	NKTR-214 is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine designed for the treatment of solid tumors.
906709_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	NKTR-214 is designed to preferentially activate the IL-2 beta sub-receptors and gamma sub-units of the IL-2 receptor in order to proliferate tumor-killing T cells within the body (CD8-positive effector T cells and natural killer T cells) without stimulating regulatory T cells (CD4-positive T cells).
906709_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	This receptor selectivity is intended to increase efficacy and improve safety over existing immunostimulatory cytokine drugs.
906709_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	In June 2015, we and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced a research collaboration that includes a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate NKTR-214 in a variety of tumor types as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, including PD-1 pathway inhibitors.
906709_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	In December 2015, we announced that dosing had commenced in the Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of NKTR-214 in patients with advanced solid tumors, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	As part of the Phase 1/2 clinical study program, we will also evaluate NKTR-214 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor.
906709_16_ITEM1_P82_S3	On February 1, 2016, we announced positive preclinical data was published in a manuscript in Clinical Cancer Research for NKTR-214.
906709_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	Nektar scientists conducted a series of studies using preclinical models of breast tumors (EMT6) and colon tumors (CT26) to assess the safety and efficacy of both single agent and combination dosing of NKTR-214 with checkpoint inhibitors, either an anti-PD-1 therapy or an anti-CTLA-4 therapy.
906709_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	The studies also compared NKTR-214 single agent and combination dosing regimens with single agent and combination dosing regimens of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	In both the breast and colon tumor models, the combination dosing regimens of NKTR-214 therapy with anti-PD-1 therapy or anti-CTLA-4 therapy resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition as well as complete regression of tumors in some animals.
906709_16_ITEM1_P83_S3	In the aggressive EMT6 breast tumor model where activity with single-agent anti-PD-1 therapy or single-agent anti-CTLA-4 therapy was not observed, combination of NKTR-214 plus either anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 demonstrated substantial efficacy.
906709_16_ITEM1_P83_S4	The combination of NKTR-214 plus anti-PD-1 or NKTR-214 plus anti-CTLA-4 produced complete tumor regressions in 40% and 70% of the animals, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM1_P83_S5	NKTR-214 was also very well-tolerated when co-administered with either antibody in these preclinical studies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	NKTR-171 (neuropathic pain) NKTR-171 is a novel, orally-available sodium channel blocker and is being developed as a treatment for neuropathic pain.
906709_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	NKTR-171 is a new molecular entity that is designed to treat neuropathic pain by blocking hyperactive neuronal sodium channels associated with damaged nerves in the peripheral nervous system.

906709_16_ITEM1_P125_S4	In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with UCB is terminated or expires.
906709_16_ITEM1_P125_S5	This sale is further discussed in Note 7 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
906709_16_ITEM1_P125_S6	We share a portion of the payments we receive from UCB with Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
906709_16_ITEM1_P125_S7	The agreement expires upon the expiration of all of UCB s royalty obligations, provided that the agreement can be extended for successive two year renewal periods upon mutual agreement of the parties.
906709_16_ITEM1_P125_S8	In addition, UCB may terminate the agreement should it cease the development and marketing of CIMZIA and either party may terminate for cause under certain conditions.
906709_16_ITEM1_P126_S0	In December 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), which was amended and restated in its entirety in December 2005.
906709_16_ITEM1_P126_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, we license our intellectual property related to our proprietary PEGylation materials for the manufacture and commercialization of Roche s MIRCERA product.
906709_16_ITEM1_P127_S0	MIRCERA is a novel continuous erythropoietin receptor activator indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S0	As of the end of 2006, we were no longer required to manufacture and supply our proprietary PEGylation materials for MIRCERA under our original agreement.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S1	In February 2012, we entered into a toll-manufacturing agreement with Roche under which we manufactured our proprietary PEGylation material for MIRCERA .
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S2	Roche entered into the toll-manufacturing agreement with the objective of establishing us as a secondary back-up source on a non-exclusive basis through December 31, 2016.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S3	Under the terms of this agreement, Roche paid us an up-front payment of $5.0 million plus a total of $22.0 million in performance-based milestone payments upon our achievement of certain manufacturing readiness, validation and production milestones, including the delivery of specified quantities of PEGylation materials, all of which were successfully completed by the end of January 2013.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S4	Roche would also pay us additional consideration for any future orders of the PEGylation materials for MIRCERA beyond the initial quantities ordered as part of the initial arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S5	In August 2013, we agreed to deliver additional quantities of PEGylation materials used by Roche to produce PEGASYS and MIRCERA , all of which were delivered by the fourth quarter of 2013, for total consideration of approximately $18.6 million.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S6	Roche may terminate the toll-manufacturing agreement due to an uncured material default by us or for convenience under certain circumstances and subject to certain financial obligations.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S7	We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the MIRCERA product.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S8	In February 2012, we sold all of our future rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA effective as of January 1, 2012.
906709_16_ITEM1_P128_S9	This sale is further discussed in Note 7 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
906709_16_ITEM1_P129_S0	The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries.
906709_16_ITEM1_P129_S1	These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
906709_16_ITEM1_P130_S0	The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms.
906709_16_ITEM1_P130_S1	If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
906709_16_ITEM1_P131_S0	submission to the FDA of an NDA for approval of a drug, a Biological License Application (BLA) for approval of a biological product or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or Premarket Notification 510(k) for a medical device product (a 510(k)).
906709_16_ITEM1_P132_S0	If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests , including those relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA , and clinical trials, may not be necessary if the company has a right of reference to existing preclinical or clinical data under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Services Act.
906709_16_ITEM1_P132_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation.
906709_16_ITEM1_P132_S2	Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations.
906709_16_ITEM1_P132_S3	The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin.
906709_16_ITEM1_P132_S4	Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires clarification within that period.
906709_16_ITEM1_P133_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review.
906709_16_ITEM1_P133_S1	Drug products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).
906709_16_ITEM1_P133_S2	Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P133_S3	Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
906709_16_ITEM1_P133_S4	Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P133_S5	The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted.
906709_16_ITEM1_P133_S6	The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical study.
906709_16_ITEM1_P134_S0	Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases.
906709_16_ITEM1_P135_S0	Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion.
906709_16_ITEM1_P135_S1	Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
906709_16_ITEM1_P136_S0	identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
906709_16_ITEM1_P137_S0	If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability.
906709_16_ITEM1_P138_S0	The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk.
906709_16_ITEM1_P138_S1	In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S0	Following a series of formal meetings and communications between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S1	The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S2	Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S3	Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S4	Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S5	Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S6	The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs.
906709_16_ITEM1_P139_S7	After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
906709_16_ITEM1_P140_S0	Each manufacturing establishment producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment.
906709_16_ITEM1_P140_S1	Such inspections are also held periodically after the commercialization.
906709_16_ITEM1_P140_S2	Establishments handling controlled substances must also be licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
906709_16_ITEM1_P140_S3	Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1_P141_S0	They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, e nvironmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
906709_16_ITEM1_P142_S0	For product candidates currently under development utilizing pulmonary technology, the pulmonary inhaler devices are considered to be part of a drug and device combination for deep lung delivery of each specific molecule.
906709_16_ITEM1_P143_S0	The FDA will make a determination as to the most appropriate center and division within the agency that will assume primary responsibility for the review of the applicable applications, which would consist of an IND and an NDA or BLA where CDER or CBER are determined to have primary jurisdiction or an investigational device exemption application and PMA or 510(k) where the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is determined to have primary jurisdiction.
906709_16_ITEM1_P143_S1	In the case of our product candidates, CDER in consultation with CDRH could be involved in the review.
906709_16_ITEM1_P144_S0	The assessment of jurisdiction within the FDA is based upon the primary mode of action of the drug or the location of the specific expertise in one of the centers.
906709_16_ITEM1_P144_S1	Where CDRH is determined to have primary jurisdiction over a product, 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is required.
906709_16_ITEM1_P145_S0	Medical devices are classified into one of three classes Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
906709_16_ITEM1_P145_S1	Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a Premarket Notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device.
906709_16_ITEM1_P145_S2	This process is known as 510(k) clearance.
906709_16_ITEM1_P145_S3	Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement.
906709_16_ITEM1_P145_S4	Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring PMA approval.
906709_16_ITEM1_P146_S0	In situations where our partners are responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, but we may participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for the inhaler device, PEGylation materials or drug.
906709_16_ITEM1_P146_S1	For our proprietary products, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for product candidates being developed under an IND.
906709_16_ITEM1_P147_S0	The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
906709_16_ITEM1_P147_S1	Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.
906709_16_ITEM1_P147_S2	Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs.
906709_16_ITEM1_P147_S3	Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
906709_16_ITEM1_P148_S0	In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.
906709_16_ITEM1_P148_S1	The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years.
906709_16_ITEM1_P148_S2	In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products.
906709_16_ITEM1_P149_S0	Once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity, a second product that is considered to be the same drug for the same indication generally may be approved during the exclusivity period only if the second product is shown to be clinically superior to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
906709_16_ITEM1_P150_S0	Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the EU.
906709_16_ITEM1_P151_S0	In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation to a product candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.
906709_16_ITEM1_P151_S1	Important features of Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation include a potentially reduced clinical program and close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development.
906709_16_ITEM1_P152_S0	Patents and Proprietary Rights We own more than 215 U.S. and 750 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P152_S1	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1_P152_S2	More specifically, our patents and patent applications cover polymer architecture, drug conjugates, formulations, methods of making polymers and polymer conjugates, methods of administering polymer conjugates, and methods of manufacturing polymers and polymer conjugates.
906709_16_ITEM1_P152_S3	Our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, some of which we acquired in our acquisition of Shearwater Corporation in June 2001.
906709_16_ITEM1_P152_S4	Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world.
906709_16_ITEM1_P153_S0	have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid).
906709_16_ITEM1_P153_S1	In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws an d regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent.
906709_16_ITEM1_P154_S0	In January 2002, we entered into a Cross-License and Option Agreement with Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Enzon), pursuant to which we and Enzon provided certain licenses to selected portions of each party s PEGylation patent portfolio.
906709_16_ITEM1_P154_S1	In certain cases, we have the option to license certain of Enzon s PEGylation patents for use in our proprietary products or for sublicenses to third parties in each case in exchange for payments to Enzon based on manufacturing profits, revenue share or royalties on net sales if a designated product candidate is approved in one or more markets.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business, associated technology and intellectual property to Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (together referred to as Novartis) for a purchase price of $115.0 million in cash (Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale).
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S1	In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as of December 31, 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S2	Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Novartis Pharma AG grants back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights acquired by Novartis from us in the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as well as certain improvements or modifications thereto that are made by Novartis.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S3	Certain of such patent rights and other related intellectual property rights relate to our development program for inhaled vancomycin or are necessary for us to satisfy certain continuing contractual obligations to third parties, including in connection with development, manufacture, sale, and commercialization activities related to BAY41-6551 partnered with Bayer Healthcare LLC.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S4	We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S5	No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S6	Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S7	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S8	In certain situations in which we work with drugs covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S9	Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages.
906709_16_ITEM1_P155_S10	Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S1	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S2	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S3	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage).
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S4	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S5	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patent.
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S6	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_16_ITEM1_P156_S7	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_16_ITEM1_P157_S0	U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights exist that are owned by third parties and relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, medical devices and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions.
906709_16_ITEM1_P157_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, of these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_16_ITEM1_P157_S2	We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims.
906709_16_ITEM1_P157_S3	Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages.
906709_16_ITEM1_P158_S0	In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties.
906709_16_ITEM1_P158_S1	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology.
906709_16_ITEM1_P158_S2	The failure to obtain licenses if needed may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1_P158_S3	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_16_ITEM1_P159_S0	It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
906709_16_ITEM1_P159_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
906709_16_ITEM1_P159_S2	The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property.
906709_16_ITEM1_P159_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
906709_16_ITEM1_P159_S4	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements with partners, under which we may receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties or product sales revenue.
906709_16_ITEM1_P159_S5	AstraZeneca and UCB represented 57% and 13% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM1_P159_S6	No other collaboration partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM1_P160_S0	Backlog Pursuant to our collaboration agreements, we manufacture and supply our proprietary PEGylation materials.
906709_16_ITEM1_P160_S1	Inventory is produced and sales are made pursuant to customer purchase orders for delivery.
906709_16_ITEM1_P160_S2	The volume of our proprietary PEGylation materials actually ordered by our customers, as well as shipment schedules, are subject to frequent revisions that reflect changes in both the customers needs and our manufacturing capacity.
906709_16_ITEM1_P160_S3	In our partnered programs where we provide contract research services, those services are typically provided under a work plan that is subject to frequent revisions that change based on the development needs and status of the program.
906709_16_ITEM1_P160_S4	The backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including scheduled date of manufacture and delivery and development program status.
906709_16_ITEM1_P160_S5	In light of industry practice and our own experience, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results.
906709_16_ITEM1_P161_S0	Competition Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and characterized by aggressive research and development and rapidly-evolving science, technology, and standards of medical care throughout the world.
906709_16_ITEM1_P161_S1	We frequently compete with pharmaceutical companies and other institutions with greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_16_ITEM1_P161_S2	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S0	Science and Technology Competition We believe that our proprietary and partnered products will compete with others in the market on the basis of one or more of the following parameters: efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost.
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S1	We face intense science and technology competition from a multitude of technologies seeking to enhance the efficacy, safety and ease of use of approved drugs and new drug molecule candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S2	A number of the drug candidates in our pipeline have direct and indirect competition from large pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S3	With our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies, we believe we have competitive advantages relating to factors such as efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost for certain applications and molecules.
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S4	We constantly monitor scientific and medical developments in order to improve our current technologies, seek licensing opportunities where appropriate, and determine the best applications for our technology platforms.
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S5	In the fields of PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies, our competitors include Biogen Idec Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories, Ltd., Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, NOF Corporation, and Novo Nordisk A/S (assets formerly held by Neose Technologies, Inc.).
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S6	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing PEGylation technology, advanced polymer conjugate technology or technologies intended to deliver similar scientific and medical benefits.
906709_16_ITEM1_P162_S7	Some of these companies license intellectual property or PEGylation materials to other companies, while others apply the technology to create their own drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1_P163_S0	There are no other once-daily oral drugs that act specifically to block or reverse the action of opioids on receptors in the gastrointestinal tract which are approved specifically for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) or opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD) in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_16_ITEM1_P163_S1	The only approved oral treatment for opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic, non-cancer pain is a twice daily oral therapy called AMITIZA (lubiprostone), which acts by specifically activating CIC-2 chloride channels in the gastrointestinal tract to increase secretions.
906709_16_ITEM1_P163_S2	AMITIZA is marketed by Sucampo Pharmaceuticals and Takeda.
906709_16_ITEM1_P163_S3	There is also a subcutaneous treatment known as RELISTOR Subjectaneous Injection (methylnaltrexone bromide) marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Ltd (formerly Salix) under a license from Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
906709_16_ITEM1_P163_S4	In 2014, RELISTOR Subjectaneous Injection was approved by the FDA for adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain.
906709_16_ITEM1_P163_S5	On June 23, 2015, Valeant submitted an NDA to the FDA for Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) oral tablets for the treatment of OCI in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain.
906709_16_ITEM1_P164_S0	Other therapies used to treat OIC and OBD include over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, such as docusate sodium, senna, and milk of magnesia.
906709_16_ITEM1_P164_S1	These therapies do not address the underlying cause of constipation as a result of opioid use and are generally viewed as ineffective or only partially effective to treat the symptoms of OIC and OBD.
906709_16_ITEM1_P164_S2	There are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations.
906709_16_ITEM1_P165_S0	Potential competitors include Merck Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Actavis plc, Mundipharma Int.
906709_16_ITEM1_P165_S1	Limited, Theravance, Inc., Develco Pharma, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_16_ITEM1_P166_S0	[Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with Hemophilia A. ELOCTATE is intended to be an extended half-life Factor VIII therapy with prolonged circulation in the body with the potential to extend the interval between prophylactic infusions.
906709_16_ITEM1_P166_S1	Prior to its 2014 approval, the fusion protein in ELOCTATE was not used outside of the clinical trial setting for Hemophilia A patients.
906709_16_ITEM1_P166_S2	There are other long-acting Factor VIII programs in late-stage development for Hemophilia A patients.
906709_16_ITEM1_P166_S3	Bayer Healthcare and Novo Nordisk have ongoing Phase 3 clinical development programs for longer acting Factor VIII proteins based on pegylation technology approaches.
906709_16_ITEM1_P166_S4	These programs, if developed successfully and approved by health authorities, would be competitors in the longer acting Factor VIII market.
906709_16_ITEM1_P167_S0	There are numerous companies developing pain therapies designed to have less abuse potential primarily through formulation technologies and techniques applied to existing pain therapies.
906709_16_ITEM1_P168_S0	There are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for breast and ovarian cancers including but not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Afinitor (everolimus), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Ibrance (palbociclib), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Paraplatin (carboplatin), Taxol (paclitaxel), Xeloda (capecitabine) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_16_ITEM1_P168_S1	These therapies are only partially effective in treating breast and ovarian cancer.
906709_16_ITEM1_P168_S2	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company, Eisai, Inc., Roche Holding Group (including its Genentech subsidiary), GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly Co., Johnson Johnson, Sanofi Aventis S.A., and many others.
906709_16_ITEM1_P169_S0	There are currently no approved drugs on the market for adjunctive treatment or prevention of gram-negative pneumonias in mechanically ventilated patients which are also administered via the pulmonary route.
906709_16_ITEM1_P169_S1	The current standard of care includes approved intravenous antibiotics which are partially effective for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators.
906709_16_ITEM1_P169_S2	These drugs include drugs that fall into the categories of antipseudomonal cephalosporins, antipseudomonal carbepenems, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, antipseudomonal fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, and aminoglycosides, such as amikacin, gentamycin or tobramycin.
906709_16_ITEM1_P170_S0	There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors.
906709_16_ITEM1_P170_S1	In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors.
906709_16_ITEM1_P170_S2	Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Kite Pharma/NCI, Adaptimmune LLC, Celgene Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, and Novartis, Alkermes, Altor, and Armo in the cytokine-based therapies space, and Tesaro, Macrogenics, Merck, BMS, and Roche in the checkpoint inhibitor space.
906709_16_ITEM1_P171_S0	Research and Development Our total research and development expenditures can be disaggregated into the following significant types of expenses (in millions):
906709_16_ITEM1_P172_S0	Manufacturing and Supply We have a manufacturing facility located in Huntsville, Alabama that is capable of manufacturing our proprietary PEGylation materials for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
906709_16_ITEM1_P172_S1	The facility is also used to produce APIs and finished drug products to support the early phases of clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S0	The facility and associated equipment are designed and operated to be consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S1	As we do not maintain the capability to manufacture APIs (including biologics) nor finished drug products for all of our development programs, we primarily utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product for us.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S2	We source drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities from one or more suppliers.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S3	For the drug starting materials necessary for our proprietary drug candidate development, we have agreements for the supply of such drug components with drug manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S4	However, from time to time, we source critical raw materials and services from one or a limited number of suppliers and there is a risk that if such supply or services were interrupted, it would materially harm our business.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S5	In addition, we typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S6	We also utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture APIs required for later phases of clinical development and eventual commercialization for us under all applicable laws and regulations.
906709_16_ITEM1_P173_S7	As a manufacturer of PEG reagents for the U.S. market, we are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
906709_16_ITEM1_P174_S0	Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
906709_16_ITEM1_P174_S1	We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations.
906709_16_ITEM1_P174_S2	We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
906709_16_ITEM1_P175_S0	Employees and Consultants As of December 31, 2015 we had 425 employees, of which 322 employees were engaged in research and development, commercial operations and quality activities and 103 employees were engaged in general administration and business development.
906709_16_ITEM1_P175_S1	Of the 425 employees, 347 were located in the U.S. and 78 were located in India.
906709_16_ITEM1_P175_S2	We have a number of employees who hold advanced degrees, such as Ph.D.s.
906709_16_ITEM1_P175_S3	None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages.
906709_16_ITEM1_P175_S4	We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
906709_16_ITEM1_P175_S5	To complement our own expert professional staff, we utilize specialists in regulatory affairs, pharmacovigilance, process engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance, clinical development and business development.
906709_16_ITEM1_P175_S6	These individuals include scientific advisors as well as independent consultants.

906709_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Drug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive, difficult to design and implement and highly uncertain as to outcome.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	It will take us, or our collaborative partners, many years to conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our and our partners financial constraints.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Drug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of preclinical and clinical development.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The risk of failure increases for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to NKTR-102, NKTR-181, NKTR-214 and other drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S8	For example, while we believe our NKTR-181 Phase 3 clinical program employs the most appropriate clinical trial design, we were unable to identify a single cause for the Phase 2 study for NKTR-181 not meeting its primary efficacy endpoint, and therefore there is increased risk in effectively designing a Phase 3 clinical program for NKTR-181.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S9	The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S10	The risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S11	A number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy or safety, even after achieving preclinical proof-of-concept or positive results from earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing regulatory authorities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of our clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase clinical trials of the product candidate.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We, the FDA, IRB, an independent ethics committee, or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee may suspend a clinical trial at a particular trial site.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If one or more of our drug candidates fail in clinical studies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our results of operations and financial condition depend significantly on the ability of our collaboration partners to successfully develop and market drugs and they may fail to do so.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Under our collaboration agreements with various pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, our collaboration partner is generally solely responsible for:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	marketing and selling the drugs when and if they are approved.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of significant risks to our business, including risks that:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Given these risks, the success of our current and future collaboration partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business in particular, we expect the commercial outcomes of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE TM (previously referred to as BAX 855) to have a particularly significant impact on our near to mid- term financial results and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Additionally, there are also several important drugs in later stage development with collaboration partners including Amikacin Inhale, Cipro DPI, and Fovista .
906709_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If the approved drugs fail to achieve commercial success or the drugs in development fail to have positive late stage clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory approval in major markets, it could significantly impair our access to capital necessary to fund our research and development efforts for our proprietary drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital resources to advance our drug candidate pipeline, it would negatively impact the value of our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are a party to certain significant agreements, including an asset purchase agreement with Novartis pursuant to which we sold a significant portion of our pulmonary business at the end of 2008, the worldwide exclusive license agreement with AstraZeneca related to the further development and commercialization of MOVANTIK TM , and the purchase and sale agreement with RPI Finance Trust (RPI) related to the sale of our royalty interests in UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA that we completed in February 2012.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Each of these agreements contains complex representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If we breach any of our agreements with Novartis, AstraZeneca, RPI or any other third party agreements, it could subject us to substantial liabilities and harm our financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	From time to time, we have informal dispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	For example, in 2015 we filed a lawsuit against Allergan and MAP seeking economic damages related to a dispute over the economic sharing provisions of our license agreement with MAP.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or third-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business , results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive review process for safety and efficacy by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The time required for obtaining regulatory decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	For example, while data from certain pre-specified subgroups in the BEACON study was positive, the study did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint and the FDA and European Medicines Agency rarely approve drugs on the basis of studies that do not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Further, regulatory authorities have the discretion to analyze data using their own methodologies that may differ from those used by us or our partners which could lead such authorities to arrive at different conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P14_S6	For example, AstraZeneca will be conducting a post-marketing, observational epidemiological study comparing MOVANTIK TM to other treatments of OIC in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain and the results of this study could at some point in the future negatively impact the labeling, regulatory status, and commercial potential of MOVANTIK TM .
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our partnered drugs that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we do not receive substantial milestone or royalty payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $308.9 million.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Also, as of December 31, 2015, we had $255.8 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes and $5.8 million of capital lease obligations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate suffic ient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments and we choose to continue our later stage research and development programs, we may need to pursue financing alternatives, including dilutive equity-based financings, such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock, which would dilute the percentage ownership o f our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of o ur research and development programs.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	While we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have not been able to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, there is a risk that a technique could be discovered in the future to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, which would significantly diminish the value of this drug candidate.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	An important objective of our NKTR-181 drug development program is to create a unique opioid molecule that does not rapidly enter a patient s central nervous system and therefore has the potential to be less susceptible to abuse than alternative opioid therapies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	To date, we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have been unable to convert NKTR-181 into a rapidly-acting, more abusable form of opioid.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In the future, an alternative chemistry technique, process or method of administration, or combination thereof, may be discovered to enable the conversion of NKTR-181 into a more abusable opioid, which could significantly and negatively impact the commercial potential or diminish the value of NKTR-181.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	It is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, drug scheduling status, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our product candidates following approval by regulatory authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate or, if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and this would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations .
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We also depend on our relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and the commercialization of product candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Poor performance by these companies, or disputes with these companies, could negatively impact our revenue and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	The timing of new collaboration partnerships is difficult to predict due to availability of clinical data, the outcomes from our clinical studies, the number of potential partners that need to complete due diligence and approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If we are unable to find suitable partners or negotiate collaboration arrangements with favorable commercial terms with respect to our existing and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P19_S8	Preliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data become available.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	From time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Preliminary data remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Delays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us or our partners could result in delay in regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	We or our partners may experience delays in clinical trials of drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S5	We currently have ongoing clinical studies for NKTR-181 in patients with chronic lower back pain and initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study for NKTR-214 in December 2015.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S6	In addition, our collaboration partners have several ongoing Phase 3 clinical programs including Baxalta for ADYNOVATE TM (previously referred to as BAX 855), Bayer for Amikacin Inhale and CIPRO Inhale, and Ophthotech for Fovista .
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S7	These and other clinical studies may not begin on time, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	changes in regulatory authorities policies or guidance applicable to our drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If the initiation or completion of any of the planned clinical studies for our drug candidates is delayed for any of the above or other reasons, the regulatory approval process would be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of these drug candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In certain cases, we have existing licenses or cross-licenses with third parties; however, the scope and adequacy of these licenses is very uncertain and can change substantially during long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P24_S3	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P24_S4	If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be prevented from developing and commercializing the drug, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P24_S6	If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We own more than 215 U.S. and 750 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant and/or broad coverage).
906709_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Further, o ur competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	substantial delays, patents may expire earl y and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patents.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply would actually issue as patents, or do so with commercially relevant and/or broad coverage.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	An adverse outcome in any judicial proceeding involving intellectual property, including patents, could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our ability to freely commercialize our technologies or products.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We are involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S5	From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S6	A third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, they could effectively prevent us, or our partners, from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Costs associated with litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Third-party claims involving proprietary rights or other matters could also result in substantial settlement payments or substantial damages to be paid by us.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	For instance, a settlement might require us to enter a license agreement under which we would pay substantial royalties or other compensation to a third party, diminishing our future economic returns from the related drug.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P29_S5	In December 2013, we entered into a litigation settlement with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) pursuant to which we agreed to pay $12.0 million and certain other terms and conditions in exchange for the full release of certain breach of contract claims by SUNY.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P29_S6	In addition, from time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings where we or other third parties are enforcing or seeking intellectual property rights, invalidating or limiting patent rights that have already been allowed or issued, or otherwise asserting proprietary rights through one or more potential legal remedies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	PEGylated Factor VIII which we have exclusively licensed to Baxalta.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The subject matter of our patent filings in this proceeding relates to Bayer s investigational PEGylated recombinant Factor VIII compound.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	We believe that Bayer s claim to an ownership interest in these patent filings is without merit and are vigorously defending sole and exclusive ownership rights to this intellectual property.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S3	We are also regularly involved in opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office where third parties seek to invalidate or limit the scope of our allowed European patent applications covering (among other things) our drugs and platform technologies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S4	We are also aware of an inter partes review petition that was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by Neptune Generics, which is an affiliate of Gerchen Keller Capital.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The filing is directed to one of six Orange Book listed patents covering MOVANTIK TM .
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S6	We believe this petition is without merit and AstraZeneca and Nektar will vigorously defend the validity of this patent.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S7	The cost to us in initiating or defending any litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management s attention.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P30_S8	Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts or result in financial implications either in terms of seeking license arrangements or payment of damages or royalties.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to laws and other governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condi tion.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We and our contract manufacturers are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and with laws and regulations governing manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and are subject to inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions administering such requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers adherence to such cGMP and other laws and governmental regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures, administrative detention, or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S7	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S8	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient drug quantities meeting applicable quality standards required to support large clinical studies or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner, it could delay our or our collaboration partners clinical studies or result in a breach of our contractual obligations, which could in turn reduce the potential commercial sales of our or our collaboration partners products.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P31_S9	As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages and any product sales or royalty revenue that we would otherwise be entitled to receive could be reduced, delayed or eliminated.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In some cases, we rely on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply drug product for our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturing of drugs and devices involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstration of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process and analytical methods validations, device performance and challenges in controlling for all of these variables.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party contract manufacturers required for drug and device supply to support our clinical studies and the clinical studies and products of our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Failure by us or our contract manufacturers to supply drug product or devices in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical studies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In the past we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We experienced repeated significant delays in starting the Phase 3 clinical development program for Amikacin Inhale as we sought to finalize and validate the device design with a demonstrated capability to be manufactured at commercial scale.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Drug/device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient and doctor use, maintenance of clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, from which we receive upfront fees, contract research payments, milestone and other contingent payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and manufacturing revenue.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from significant payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch or the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S3	The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S4	Our past revenue generated from collaboration agreements is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S5	If any of our existing or future collaboration partners fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture or ultimately commercialize any product candidate under our collaboration agreement, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S6	If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates successfully.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S7	We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S8	To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must either develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S9	If we decide to market our products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P36_S10	Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or indirectly with our partners include:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	If we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	To the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and over which we have little or no control important examples of this risk include MOVANTIK partnered with AstraZeneca and ADYNOVATE TM (previously referred to as BAX 855) partnered with Baxalta.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment, and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	We purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	We often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunities or contract liabilities to third parties.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S6	For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P38_S7	Any interruption in supply or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary r ights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P39_S4	Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P39_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported a net loss of $81.2 million.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone and other contingent payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	If government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Such third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P42_S5	A government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products would limit market acceptance of such products.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Though we are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trials, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S6	The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or the failure of third parties to properly conduct our clinical trials could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P43_S7	Significant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Competitors of our PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technologies include Biogen Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S (formerly assets held by Neose Technologies, Inc.), and NOF Corporation.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing PEGylation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	There are many competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in development.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	For Amikacin Inhale, the current standard of care includes several approved intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Subcutaneous Injection, oral Amitizia (lubiprostone), and oral and rectal over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In addition, there are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Merck Co., Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Develco Pharma GmbH, Alkermes plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Theravance, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P47_S2	For ADYNOVATE TM , on June 6, 2014, the FDA approved Biogen Idec s ELOCTATE for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with Hemophilia A, and Bayer Healthcare and Novo Nordisk have ongoing Phase 3 clinical development programs for longer acting Factor VIII proteins based on pegylation technology approaches.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	For NKTR-181, there are numerous companies developing pain therapies designed to have less abuse potential primarily through formulation technologies and techniques applied to existing pain therapies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	For NKTR-102 there are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for breast cancer, including, but not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Xeloda (capecitabine), Afinitor (everolimus), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Ibrance (palbociclib), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Iniparib, Paraplatin (carboplatin), Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for breast cancers include, but are not limited to, Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Eisai Inc., and Sanofi Aventis S.A.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Kite Pharma/NCI, Adaptimmune LLC, Celgene Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, and Novartis, Alkermes, Altor, and Armo in the cytokine-based therapies space, and Tesaro, Macrogenics, Merck, BMS, and Roche in the checkpoint inhibitor space.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S5	Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S6	Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S7	If we make a decision to bear a majority or all of the clinical development costs of NKTR-102 this will substantially increase our future capital requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S8	If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S9	If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S10	Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S11	We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S12	Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S13	The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S14	The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S15	We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S16	Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S17	We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S18	Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S19	We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, research, regulatory and finance, and may need to attract and retain marketing and distribution experts and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S20	We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S21	Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S22	Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S23	Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S24	Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P51_S25	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If earthquakes or other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S3	There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S4	In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, political instability, or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply materials for drug candidates in development and our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Our collaborative partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S6	We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S7	In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S8	We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P52_S9	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Further, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then-current market prices.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	We also have a change of control severance benefit plan, which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S3	This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S4	The price of our common stock is expected to remain volatile.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2015, based on closing prices on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, our stock price ranged from $9.50 to $17.41 per share.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S6	We expect our stock price to remain volatile.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P54_S7	A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including the risks described in this section titled Risk Factors and the following:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	At times, our stock price has been volatile even in the absence of significant news or developments.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The stock prices of biotechnology companies and securities markets generally have been subject to dramatic price swings in recent years.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	The indenture governing our 7.75% senior secured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P56_S2	On October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The indenture governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to take various actions, including, among other things:
906709_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	consummate a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination, sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or other change of control transaction.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	This indenture also requires us to maintain a minimum cash balance of $60.0 million.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	We have certain reporting obligations under the indenture regarding cash position and royalty revenue.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The indenture specifies a number of events of default, some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, non-payment of material judgments, loss of any material business license, criminal indictment of the Company, and certain civil forfeiture proceedings involving material assets of the Company.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	Our failure to comply with our obligations could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness and the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes.
906709_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	The restrictions contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.

906709_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected consolidated financial data set forth below should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the other information contained herein.
906709_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on net sales of UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA .
906709_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_16_ITEM6_P1_S2	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests starting in the second quarter of 2012, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
906709_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_16_ITEM6_P3_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	We are a biopharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our current proprietary pipeline is comprised of drug candidates across a number of therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives, and immunology.
906709_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Our research and development activities involve small molecule drugs, peptides and protein biologic drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	We create innovative drug candidates by using our proprietary advanced polymer conjugate technologies and expertise to modify the chemical structure of pharmacophores to create new molecular entities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Polymer chemistry is a science focused on the synthesis or bonding of polymer architectures with drug molecules to alter the properties of a molecule.
906709_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Additionally, we may utilize established pharmacologic targets to engineer a new drug candidate relying on a combination of the known properties of these targets and our proprietary polymer chemistry technology and expertise.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our drug candidates are designed to improve the overall benefits and use of a drug for patients by improving the metabolism, distribution, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, half-life and/or bioavailability of drugs.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our objective is to apply our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform to create new drug candidates in multiple therapeutic areas that address large potential markets.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK TM (previously referred to as naloxegol and NKTR-118), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	MOVANTIK TM is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, a side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	MOVANTIK TM was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	On March 31, 2015, AstraZeneca announced that it launched MOVANTIK TM in the United States, as a result of which we received a $100 million commercial launch milestone on March 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S6	In August 2015, we received an additional $40.0 million payment triggered by the first commercial sale of MOVENTIG by AstraZeneca in Germany.
906709_16_ITEM7_P2_S7	Given the significant sales milestone and royalty opportunity for us associated with MOVANTIK TM under our AstraZeneca license agreement, the level of sales achieved by AstraZeneca for MOVANTIK TM will have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition over the coming years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	We have a collaboration with Baxalta to identify and develop PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	Under this collaboration, we worked with Baxalta to develop ADYNOVATE TM (previously referred to as BAX 855), an investigational, extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for Hemophilia A based on ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)].
906709_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	In November 2015, ADYNOVATE TM was approved by the FDA for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. Baxalta announced the launch and first shipments of ADYNOVATE TM on November 30, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	In December 2015, Baxalta announced positive study results in patients younger than 12 years of age with severe Hemophilia A. With the study results, Baxalta announced that it plans to file for marketing authorization in Europe and aims to file for a pediatric indication in the U.S. in early 2016.
906709_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	ADYNOVATE TM is currently under regulatory review in Japan, Canada and Switzerland.
906709_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	The level of sales achieved by Baxalta for ADYNOVATE TM and our related royalties will be important to our operating results and financial condition over the coming years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions and is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.
906709_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	We enrolled the first patient in the first Phase 3 efficacy study in February 2015 and the study continues to enroll patients.
906709_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	In this study, we are randomizing patients with chronic low back pain in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which will include a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 is given to all patients, followed by a 12 week double-blind randomized period where subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	The NKTR-181 Phase 3 study design includes a single interim sample size assessment to be conducted by an independent analysis center (IAC) after approximately fifty percent of the initially planned 416 patients completed the study.
906709_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The protocol of the NKTR-181 study defined only two possible outcomes for this pre-planned blinded interim sample size assessment: (1) if the conditional powering at the midpoint of the trial fell between 50-85%, the sample size was to be increased by about 200 patients; or (2) if the conditional powering fell below 50%, or above 85%, the sample size was not to be changed.
906709_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	The IAC s determination is nondiscretionary and was based upon our determination of pre-defined acceptable power to detect a statistically significant difference between NKTR-181 and placebo based on the primary efficacy endpoint.
906709_16_ITEM7_P6_S3	On February 29, 2016, the IAC instructed Nektar to increase the sample size by about 200 patients.
906709_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	In Decem ber 2015, we dosed the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical study for NKTR-214, which is our engineered immunostimulatory CD122-biased cytokine designed to preferentially activate the beta and gamma sub-units of the IL-2 receptor in order to proliferate t umor-killing T cells within the body (CD8-positive effector T cells and natural killer T cells) without stimulating regulatory T cells (CD4-positive T cells).
906709_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	The study is being conducted initially at two primary investigator sites: the University of Texa s MD Anderson Cancer Center and Yale Cancer Center.
906709_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	The dose-escalation stage of the Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate safety, efficacy, and define the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 in approximately 20 patients with solid tumors.
906709_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition to a determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study will assess preliminary anti-tumor activity, includi ng objective response rate .
906709_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	The immunologic effect of NKTR-214 on tumor-infiltrati ng lymphocytes and other immune infiltrating cells in both blood and tumor tissue will also be assessed.
906709_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	Following the dose-escalation stage of the study, dose expansion cohorts are planned to evaluate NKTR-214 in specific tumor types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer .
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	NKTR-102 is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	On March 17, 2015, we announced topline data from a Phase 3 clinical study for NKTR-102, which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	The BEACON study compared NKTR-102 to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	In a topline analysis of 852 patients from the trial, NKTR-102 provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival (OS) over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving NKTR-102 compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the NKTR-102 group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S5	Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S6	We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroups patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S7	We are currently exploring various future regulatory and development paths forward for NKTR-102 with the EU and U.S. regulatory authorities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S8	In Europe, we have met with the National Authorities in Sweden (MPA) and the United Kingdom (MHRA) to discuss the BEACON data.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S9	We also met with the EMA to discuss filing an MAA.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S10	Based on the outcome of these meetings, we believe that there is a path forward to file an MAA for conditional approval of NKTR-102 for patients with metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S11	In connection with any MAA filing, we would be required to start a confirmatory trial in conjunction with the MAA review.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S12	In the United States, we met with the FDA and the Oncology Division indicated that we would not be able to use the BEACON data to support an accelerated approval for an NDA.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S13	However, the FDA staff also indicated that positive results from a completed confirmatory trial for the MAA could also support an NDA filing.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S14	We are currently evaluating next steps and potential designs and costs for a confirmatory trial.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S15	At this time, we do not plan to advance development of NKTR-102 without a collaboration partner.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S16	We also have two significant drug development programs with Bayer.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S17	The first is a collaboration to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S18	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and the NKTR-061 drug candidate and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S19	Bayer is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical study for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S20	Bayer is conducting this study under a Special Protocol Assessment process agreed to with the FDA.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S21	The second is our significant royalty rights in the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) program with Bayer that we transferred to Novartis as part of the 2008 pulmonary asset divestiture transaction.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S22	In August 2012, Bayer initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S23	These programs represent a significant future economic opportunity for us.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S24	While the approved drugs and clinical development programs described above are key elements of our future success, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier-stage drug candidate pipeline.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S25	We have several drug candidates in earlier stage clinical development or being explored in research that we are preparing to advance into the clinic in future years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S26	We are also advancing several other drug candidates in preclinical development in the areas of cancer immunotherapy, pain and other therapeutic indications.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S27	While we believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results, receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets and achieves commercial success, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results are extremely difficult to predict.
906709_16_ITEM7_P9_S28	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial condition and prospects, results of operations and market value.
906709_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary PEGylation reagents on a fixed price or cost-plus basis.
906709_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply PEGylation reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third-party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2015, we estimated that we had at least twelve months of working capital to fund our current business plans.
906709_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $308.9 million in cash and investments in marketable securities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Also, as of December 31, 2015, we had $255.8 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes and $5.8 million of capital lease obligations.
906709_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	As is further described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020.
906709_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	We used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 2017 and to make a $12.5 million redemption payment and to pay $3.3 million in accrued interest, due upon redemption of the 12% senior secured notes.
906709_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	As a result, we received $100.3 million in net proceeds in connection with these transactions.
906709_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, license fees, milestone and other contingent payments and/or contract research payments.
906709_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations, such as manufacturing and supply commitments, is recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue.
906709_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations.
906709_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by us to determine the performance periods.
906709_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Product sales Product sales include predominantly fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and result from the receipt of firm purchase orders from those partners.
906709_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Product sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of increased product demand primarily from one of our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Product sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of decreased product demand from a number of our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	We currently expect product sales to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increased product demand primarily from one of our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products.
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Royalty revenue received in cash increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 due primarily to the launch of commercial sales by AstraZeneca of MOVANTIK TM in March 2015 and MOVENTIG in the EU in August 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	Royalty revenue received in cash decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to decreases in the underlying net sales of the applicable products as well as the completion of the royalty term for one product.
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	We expect royalty revenue in 2016 will increase as compared to 2015 due to royalties we expect to receive from net sales of MOVANTIK TM , MOVENTIG and ADYNOVATE TM .
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S6	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_16_ITEM7_P15_S7	We expect non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA in 2016 to increase compared to 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	License, collaboration and other revenue License, collaboration and other revenue includes the recognition of upfront payments, milestone and other contingent payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments, the achievement of milestones and other contingent events, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of reimbursed research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the recognition of the $140.0 million of payments received from AstraZeneca as a result of the U.S. commercial launch of MOVANTIK TM and the EU commercial launch of MOVENTIG .
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	In addition, in 2015, we recognized a $10.0 million milestone achieved in November 2015 as a result of the FDA s approval of Baxalta s ADYNOVATE TM .
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S4	During the year-ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $105.0 million of payments from AstraZeneca as a result of the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK TM in September 2014 and recognized $9.0 million of milestone payments resulting from the transfer of our manufacturing technology to two of our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S5	In addition, in 2014, we recognized $8.0 million of milestones received in December 2014 related to positive results from Baxalta s ADYNOVATE TM Phase 3 study.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S6	The increase in license, collaboration and other revenue in 2015 is offset by a total of $10.0 million that we agreed in March 2015 to pay AstraZeneca, including $5.0 million paid in July 2015 and $5.0 million to be paid in July 2016, to fund U.S. television advertising in consideration for certain additional commercial information rights.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S7	We determined that this $10.0 million obligation should be recorded as a reduction of revenue, which we recorded in 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S8	License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the recognition in 2014 of the $105.0 million of payments from AstraZeneca noted above as a result of the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK TM in September 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S9	In 2013, we received and recognized a $25.0 million payment from AstraZeneca achieved in September 2013 on the acceptance for review by the EMA of the MOVANTIK TM regulatory approval application filed by AstraZeneca as well as the recognition in July 2013 of the remaining $6.7 million deferred revenue balance related to our agreement with Affymax as a result of the termination of that agreement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S10	In addition, in April 2013, we recognized a $10.0 million milestone achieved upon the start of the Amikacin Inhale Phase 3 clinical trial by Bayer.
906709_16_ITEM7_P16_S11	We expect license, collaboration and other revenue in 2016 will decrease significantly compared to 2015 primarily due to the achievement in 2015 of the significant non-recurring payments noted above resulting from AstraZeneca s commercial launch of MOVANTIK TM and MOVENTIG .
906709_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area:
906709_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	The increase in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily attributable to increased milestone and other contingent payments from our existing European based collaboration partners, including the recognition of a total of $140.0 million payments from AstraZeneca in connection with its commercial launches of MOVANTIK TM described above.
906709_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	The increase in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 is also primarily attributable to increased milestone and other contingent payments from our existing European based collaboration partners, including the recognition of a total of $105.0 million payments from AstraZeneca in connection with the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK TM described above.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in product sales of $15.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	Cost of goods sold decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to the decrease in product sales of $19.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	The improvement in product gross profit (loss) and product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to a more favorable product mix in 2015 compared to 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S3	In particular, the manufacturing arrangement with one of our collaboration partners includes a fixed price for proprietary PEGylation reagent sales, which is less than the fully burdened manufacturing cost for the reagent and we expect this situation to continue in future years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S4	This arrangement was the primary reason for our negative gross profit in 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S5	There were fewer shipments to this partner in total and relative to shipments to other customers during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S6	In addition to product sales from reagent shipments to this partner, we also receive royalty revenues from this collaboration.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S7	In the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the royalty revenue from the collaboration exceeded the related negative gross profit on product sales.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S8	During the year ended December 31, 2013, our gross profit was positive due primarily to the higher level of product sales in 2013 as well as a more favorable product mix as compared to 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S9	We expect product gross margin to continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level and mix of manufacturing orders from our customers due to the predominantly fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P20_S10	We currently expect product gross margin to increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of an anticipated increase in product sales, as well as based on the anticipated product mix.
906709_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of clinical study costs, direct costs of outside research, materials, supplies, licenses and fees as well as personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation).
906709_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of support and facilities-related costs.
906709_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	Research and development expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the initiation of Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181 in the first quarter of 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	Research and development expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to reduced activities on our Phase 3 BEACON study for NKTR-102 as the study progressed toward completion as well as the completion of our Phase 2 clinical study for NKTR-181 in the third quarter of 2013.
906709_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a charge of $11.3 million resulting from the settlement of a dispute with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York related to our collaboration with Bayer to develop Amikacin Inhale.
906709_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs.
906709_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	The following table shows expenses incurred for clinical and regulatory services, clinical supplies, and preclinical study support provided by third parties as well as direct materials costs for each of our drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1.
906709_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	We partnered this program with Bayer Healthcare LLC in August 2007.
906709_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale in 2008, we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	We expect research and development expense in 2016 to be consistent with 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	In particular, in 2016, we are continuing Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Over the next two to three years, we expect that the NKTR-181 clinical development program will require a substantial investment.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	We currently estimate that the total third party and direct material costs over the life of our NKTR-181 Phase 3 program will be approximately $130.0 million, of which $40.3 million was incurred through the end of 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S4	In addition to our NKTR-181 development activities, in 2016, we plan to continue to advance the development of NKTR-214, which entered Phase 1/2 clinical development in December 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S5	In addition, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale-up for the nebulizer devices to supply Bayer for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S6	Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer, we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for this drug candidate.
906709_16_ITEM7_P25_S7	We do not expect to have any significant future research and development costs associated with MOVANTIK TM or the MOVANTIK TM fixed-dose combination products as AstraZeneca is responsible for all further development and commercialization costs for these drug candidates.
906709_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our PEGylation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
906709_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	In order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development, each drug candidate must be tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies.
906709_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete.
906709_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
906709_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	Furthermore, our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for MOVANTIK TM and Amikacin Inhale.
906709_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	In these situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control.
906709_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	General and administrative expense includes the cost of administrative staffing, business development, marketing, finance, and legal activities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	General and administrative expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a $3.0 million payment obligation related to the settlement of a commercial litigation matter.
906709_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	General and administrative expense was consistent during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.
906709_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	In 2016, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease marginally compared to 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased marginally compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to our secured note financing transaction in October 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	As is further described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020 and used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased marginally as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	We expect interest expense to increase in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of the increase to our outstanding secured notes principal balance from the October 2015 note transaction, partially offset by the reduction in the interest rate on our notes from 12% to 7.75%.
906709_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	Non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 decreased marginally as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, due to the decrease in 2015 and 2014, respectively, of the average balance of the related liability as that liability balance amortizes.
906709_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser.
906709_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	We impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate, which we currently estimate to be approximately 17%.
906709_16_ITEM7_P34_S3	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the estimated interest rate, in particular, the amount and timing of royalty payments from future net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis.
906709_16_ITEM7_P34_S4	As a result, future interest rates could differ significantly and any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively.
906709_16_ITEM7_P34_S5	Unless we adjust our estimated interest rate, we expect non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for 2016 to decrease marginally compared with 2015 as a result of the expected decrease in 2016 of the royalty liability balance.
906709_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Loss on Extinguishment of Debt As a result of the secured note financing transaction in October 2015 discussed above, in the quarter and year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of our 12% notes, which consists of a $11.3 million redemption premium payment, $1.2 million of incremental interest paid at redemption to the 12% note holders and the write-off of $1.6 million of unamortized issuance costs on the 12% notes.
906709_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and research and development contracts, as well as public offering and private placements of debt and equity securities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $308.9 million in cash and investments in marketable securities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	Also, as of December 31, 2015, we had $255.8 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes and $5.8 million of capital lease obligations.
906709_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	As is further described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020.
906709_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	We used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 2017 and to make a $12.5 million redemption payment and pay $3.3 million in accrued interest, due upon redemption of the 12% senior secured notes.
906709_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	As a result, we received $100.3 million in net proceeds in connection with these transactions.
906709_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we estimated that we had at least twelve months of working capital to f und our current business plans.
906709_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including NKTR-181 , Amikacin Inhale, and NKTR- 214 , will require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the ob jective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	However, we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.
906709_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	In the past we have received a number of significant payments from collaboration agreement s and other significant transactions.
906709_16_ITEM7_P37_S4	In the future , we expect to receive royalties from commercial sales of products such as MOVANTIK TM and ADYNOVATE TM and potential substantial payments from future collaboration transactions if drug candidates in our pi peline achieve positive clinical or regulatory outcomes.
906709_16_ITEM7_P37_S5	Our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, the sales levels of products for which we are entitled to royalties such as MOVAN TIK TM , clinical program outcomes, whether, when and on what terms we are able to enter into new collaboration transactions, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and the need to satisfy cont ingent liabilities, including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on many factors including the success or failure of drug development programs in our pipeline, including NKTR-181, Amikacin Inhale and NKTR-214, as well as other early stage development programs.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	The availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies, whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining regulatory authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs, as well as general capital market conditions.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S2	We will pursue various financing alternatives as needed to continue to fund our research and development activities and to fund the expansion of our business as appropriate.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S3	Due to the potential for adverse developments in the credit markets in 2016 and thereafter, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S4	These investments are generally held to maturity, which, in accordance with our investment policy, is less than two years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S5	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S6	At December 31, 2015, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately five months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed one year.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S7	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but if such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S8	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S9	Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $73.1 million, which includes $196.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $18.8 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $142.0 million of milestones and other contingent payments from collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S10	The accounts receivable balance in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 includes a $10.0 million milestone receivable from Baxalta resulting from the FDA s approval of ADYNOVATE TM as well as $9.5 million in receivables from product sales, which were subsequently collected in 2016.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S11	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront, milestone and other contingent payments received, if any, will decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of increased cash receipts from product sales and royalties.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S12	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $142.0 million, which includes $199.0 million of net operating cash uses as well as $15.0 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $72.0 million of milestones and other contingent payments from collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S13	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized as revenue a $70.0 million payment made to us from AstraZeneca in November 2013.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S14	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled $38.5 million, which includes $158.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $15.2 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $135.0 million for milestones and other contingent payments from collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S15	Cash flows from investing activities We paid $11.2 million, $10.0 million, and $4.1 million to purchase property, plant and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S16	We expect our capital expenditures in 2016 to decrease marginally compared to 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S17	Restricted cash of $25.0 million was required to be maintained in a separate account until July 1, 2015 under the terms of our 12% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_16_ITEM7_P38_S18	This restriction expired on July 1, 2015 and the restricted funds were returned to us.
906709_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	Ca sh flows used in financing activities On October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due 2020 ( Notes ).
906709_16_ITEM7_P39_S1	The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P39_S2	Interest is calculated based on actual days outstanding over a 360 day year.
906709_16_ITEM7_P39_S3	In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we paid fees and expenses of approximately $8.9 million, of which $8.3 million of transaction and facility fees paid to the purchasers of the Notes was capitalized as a debt discount and recorded as a reduction to the note payable liability.
906709_16_ITEM7_P39_S4	An additional $0.4 million of direct issuance costs was capitalized and recorded in Other Assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
906709_16_ITEM7_P39_S5	On October 5, 2015, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due in 2017.
906709_16_ITEM7_P39_S6	In addition, on October 5, 2015, we paid accrued interest of $3.3 million and made a $12.5 million redemption payment, which includes $1.2 million additional interest paid to the 12% note holders at redemption.
906709_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	On January 28, 2014, we completed the issuance and sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering with total proceeds of approximately $117.2 million after deducting the underwriting commissions and discounts of approximately $7.5 million.
906709_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	In addition, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other costs in connection with this offering.
906709_16_ITEM7_P40_S2	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_16_ITEM7_P40_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we made payments of $7.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, to the purchaser of these royalties because certain minimum MIRCERA net sales thresholds were not met.
906709_16_ITEM7_P40_S4	The remaining $119.0 million royalty obligation liability at December 31, 2015 will not be settled in cash.
906709_16_ITEM7_P40_S5	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $32.2 million, $47.0 million, and $8.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 8 of Item 8.
906709_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	In November 2010, we moved into our Mission Bay Facility, which includes our corporate headquarters and a research and development center.
906709_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	Under the terms of the sublease we entered into with Pfizer Inc. on September 30, 2009 for the Mission Bay Facility, we began making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7_P42_S2	The sublease is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	These amounts primarily result from our purchase of manufacturing equipment supporting our Amikacin Inhale program, including our obligation to purchase certain equipment which is further discussed in Note 4 of Item 8.
906709_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	In addition, these amounts include capital lease obligations arising from our office space lease at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California.
906709_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	In November 2010, we ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of all of our California functions to our Mission Bay Facility.
906709_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	We have subleased all of the San Carlos Facility.
906709_16_ITEM7_P43_S4	This is further discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2015 that were issued under existing contracts.
906709_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	This amount does not represent any minimum contract termination liabilities for our existing contracts.
906709_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.
906709_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
906709_16_ITEM7_P46_S2	Actual results may differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
906709_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	We have determined that for the periods in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and the results of our operations.
906709_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Revenue Recognition License, collaboration and other research revenue is recognized based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes amortization of upfront fees.
906709_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	We defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed.
906709_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	The amount of upfront fees and other payments received under our license and collaboration agreements that are allocated to our continuing obligations are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research and development activities, or manufacturing activities through the completion of clinical development or the termination or expiration of the collaboration agreement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	Given the complexities and uncertainties of collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required by management to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	As of December 31, 2015, we had $19.6 million of deferred upfront fees related to two collaboration agreements that include research and development obligations that are being amortized over 11 to 22 years, or an average of approximately 16 years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	For our collaboration agreements, our performance obligations may span the life of the agreement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	For these, the shortest reasonable period is the end of the development period (estimated to be 4 to 8 years) and the longest period is the contractual life of the agreement, which is generally 10-12 years from the first commercial sale.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Given the statistical probability of drug development success in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, drug development programs have only a 5% to 10% probability of reaching commercial success.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	If we had determined a longer or shorter amortization period was appropriate, our annual upfront fee amortization for these agreements could have been as low as $2.0 million or as high as $11.0 million as compared to the approximately $2.0 million recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	As of December 31, 2015, we also had $58.6 million of deferred upfront fees related to seven license, manufacturing and supply agreements that are being amortized over periods from 3 to 15 years.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Our performance obligations for these agreements may include technology transfer assistance and/or back-up manufacturing and supply services for a specified period of time; therefore, the time estimated to complete the performance obligations related to licenses is either specified or is much shorter than the collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	We may experience delays in the execution of technology transfer plans, which may result in a longer amortization period for applicable agreements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S5	Our original estimates are periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimates to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S6	In addition, at the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S7	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S8	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_16_ITEM7_P51_S9	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical study activities performed by third parties.
906709_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients and completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions.
906709_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical studies ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical studies based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the studies.
906709_16_ITEM7_P52_S5	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_16_ITEM7_P54_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first identified.
906709_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for each respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and common stock purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).
906709_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	We expense the estimated fair value of each award, as adjusted by the estimated historical forfeiture rate, ratably over the expected service period of the award.
906709_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under our ESPP.
906709_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	In addition, management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_16_ITEM7_P56_S4	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.
906709_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	In addition, for awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate whether the awards will vest and the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments from sales of the CIMZIA and MIRCERA drug products marketed by UCB and Roche, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM7_P58_S1	Although we are required to make payments to the purchaser (RPI) only in certain situations, including the event of our breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in the Purchase and Sale Agreement that gives rise to a liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement, this royalty sale transaction was recorded as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that we will amortize using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P58_S2	As a result, we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the estimated interest rate.
906709_16_ITEM7_P58_S3	Our estimate of the interest rate under the agreement is based on the amount of royalty payments to be received by RPI over the life of the arrangement and payments we are required to make to RPI under the agreement.
906709_16_ITEM7_P58_S4	We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche using a combination of historical results and forecasts from market data sources.
906709_16_ITEM7_P58_S5	To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are made in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are higher than expected, non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense would also be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2015 should have been one percentage point higher than our current estimate of 17%, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2015 would have increased by $1.3 million.
906709_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncemen ts In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , and is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
906709_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this new guidance.
906709_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606.
906709_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability.
906709_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	This guidance is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.
906709_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	Upon adoption, the new guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
906709_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $0.6 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $0.5 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2014.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2015, we held $253.4 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of six months.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S8	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S9	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S10	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we currently do not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P0_S11	Accordingly, we believe there are no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities and have not recorded any provisions for impairment.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.
906709_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
906709_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
906709_16_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_16_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nektar Therapeutics at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_16_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
906709_16_ITEM8_P2_S1	Nektar Therapeutics management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
906709_16_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
906709_16_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_16_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
906709_16_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
906709_16_ITEM8_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_16_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_16_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_16_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Nektar Therapeutics maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.
906709_16_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Nektar Therapeutics and our report dated February 29, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_16_ITEM8_P4_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.

906709_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization We are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Francisco, California and incorporated in Delaware.
906709_16_ITEM8_P9_S1	We are developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms with the objective to improve the benefits of drugs for patients.
906709_16_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our research and development activities have required significant ongoing investment to date and are expected to continue to require significant investment.
906709_16_ITEM8_P9_S3	As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future.
906709_16_ITEM8_P9_S4	We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreements and financing transactions.
906709_16_ITEM8_P9_S5	At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $308.9 million in cash and investments in marketable securities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P9_S6	Also, as of December 31, 2015, we had $255.8 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes (as further discussed in Note 5) and $5.8 million of capital lease obligations (Note 6), of which $4.8 million is current.
906709_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Nektar Therapeutics (India) Private Limited (Nektar India) and Nektar Therapeutics UK Limited.
906709_16_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
906709_16_ITEM8_P10_S3	Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
906709_16_ITEM8_P10_S4	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity (deficit) section of the balance sheet.
906709_16_ITEM8_P10_S5	To date, such cumulative translation adjustments have not been significant to our consolidated financial position.
906709_16_ITEM8_P10_S6	Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recorded in operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were not significant.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	Accounting estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S3	Our estimates include those related to estimated selling prices of deliverables in collaboration agreements, estimated periods of performance, the net realizable value of inventory, the impairment of investments, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, contingencies, accrued clinical trial expenses, estimated non-cash royalty revenue and interest expense from our liability related to our sale of future royalties, stock-based compensation, and ongoing litigation, among other estimates.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S5	These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily apparent from other sources.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S6	As appropriate, estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information and any changes in estimates will generally be reflected in the period identified.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S7	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P11_S8	Such reclassifications do not materially impact previously reported revenue, operating loss, net loss, total assets, liabilities or stockholders equity.
906709_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	We consider all investments in marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
906709_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	Investments in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year, or where our intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations, are classified as short-term investments.
906709_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	Investments are designated as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity (deficit) as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
906709_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	The disclosed fair value related to our cash equivalents and investments is base d primarily on the reported fair values in our period-end brokerage statements, which are based on market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers and generally represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been deri ved from observable market data.
906709_16_ITEM8_P13_S2	We independently validate these fair values using available market quotes and other information.
906709_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale, as well as amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, are included in interest income.
906709_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are included in other income (expense).
906709_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
906709_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the third parties that hold or issue such assets.
906709_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality and our investment policy limits investments to fixed income securities denominated and payable in U.S. dollars such as U.S. government obligations, money market instruments and funds, and corporate bonds and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer.
906709_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	Accounts Receivable and Significant Customer Concentrations Our customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are located in the U.S. and Europe.
906709_16_ITEM8_P16_S3	Our accounts receivable balance contains billed and unbilled trade receivables from product sales, milestones, other contingent payments and royalties, as well as time and materials based billings from collaborative research and development agreements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	When appropriate, we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts.
906709_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
906709_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	We perform a regular review of our customers payment histories and associated credit risk.
906709_16_ITEM8_P17_S3	We have not experienced significant credit losses from our accounts receivable.
906709_16_ITEM8_P17_S4	At December 31, 2015, three different customers represented 50%, 35%, and 10%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_16_ITEM8_P17_S5	At December 31, 2014, three different customers represented 40%, 31%, and 15%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	Inventory and Significant Supplier Concentrations Inventory is generally manufactured upon receipt of firm purchase orders from our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	Inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead and cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
906709_16_ITEM8_P18_S2	Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and defective or excess inventory is written down to net realizable value based on historical experience or projected usage.
906709_16_ITEM8_P18_S3	Inventory related to our research and development activities is expensed when purchased.
906709_16_ITEM8_P18_S4	We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide raw materials, drugs and devices of appropriate quality and reliability and to meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P18_S5	In certain cases, we rely on single sources of supply of one or more critical materials.
906709_16_ITEM8_P18_S6	Consequently, in the event that supplies are delayed or interrupted for any reason, our ability to develop and produce our drug candidates or our ability to meet our supply obligations could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
906709_16_ITEM8_P19_S1	Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
906709_16_ITEM8_P19_S2	Manufacturing, laboratory and other equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over estimated useful lives of three to ten years.
906709_16_ITEM8_P19_S3	Leasehold improvements and buildings recorded under capital leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
906709_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for another entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
906709_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	We are organized in one reporting unit and evaluate the goodwill for the Company as a whole.
906709_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year using an October 1 measurement date.
906709_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment and goodwill, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
906709_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	When such events occur, we determine whether there has been an impairment in value by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value, as measured by the anticipated undiscounted net cash flows of the asset.
906709_16_ITEM8_P21_S2	In the case of goodwill impairment, market capitalization is generally used as the measure of fair value.
906709_16_ITEM8_P21_S3	If an impairment in value exists, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
906709_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	In March 2015, we announced that the primary endpoint for our BEACON Phase 3 clinical study for NKTR-102 as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	As a result, we performed an impairment analysis for our long-lived assets, including goodwill, as well as our primary long-lived asset group which is related to NK TR-102.
906709_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	Based on this analysis, we concluded that there is no impairment during the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM8_P22_S3	Our revenue is derived from our arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaboration partners and may result from one or more of the following: upfront and license fees, payments for contract research and development, milestone and other contingent payments, manufacturing and supply payments, and royalties.
906709_16_ITEM8_P22_S4	Our performance obligations under our collaborations may include licensing our intellectual property, manufacturing and supply obligations, and research and development obligations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	In order to account for the multiple-element arrangements, we identify the deliverables included within the arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
906709_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	Analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment, and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver goods or services, a right or license to use an asset, or another performance obligation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Revenue is recognized separately for each identified unit of accounting when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met: there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	At the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate all consideration received under multiple-element arrangements to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P24_S3	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material change in our estimates would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	Product sales Product sales are primarily derived from fixed price and cost-plus manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	We have not experienced any significant returns from our customers.
906709_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	Generally, we are entitled to royalties from our collaboration partners based on the net sales of their approved drugs that are marketed and sold in one or more countries where we hold royalty rights.
906709_16_ITEM8_P25_S3	We recognize royalty revenue when the cash is received or when the royalty amount to be received is estimable and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_16_ITEM8_P25_S4	With respect to the non-cash royalties related to sale of future royalties described in Note 7, revenue is recognized when estimable, otherwise, revenue is recognized during the period in which the related royalty report is received, which generally occurs in the quarter after the applicable product sales are made.
906709_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	The amount of upfront fees and other payments received by us in license and collaboration arrangements that are allocated to continuing performance obligations, such as manufacturing and supply obligations, are deferred and generally recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each respective arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research activities, clinical development activities, and manufacturing activities from development through the commercialization of the product.
906709_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	Given the uncertainties of these collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the performance period and this estimate is periodically re-evaluated.
906709_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved, which we believe is consistent with the substance of our performance under our various license and collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	A miles tone is defined as an event (i) that can only be achieved based in whole or in part either on the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at th e date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due to the entity.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	A milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent w ith our performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance, relates solely to our past performance, and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners provide for payments to us upon the achievement of development milestones, such as the completion of clinical trials or regulatory submissions, approvals by regulatory authorities, and commercial launches of drugs.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S3	Given the challenges inherent in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for drug products and in achieving commercial launches, there was substantial uncertainty whether any such milestones would be achieved at the time of execution of these licensing and collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S4	In addition, we evaluated whether the development milestones met the remaining criteria to be considered substantive.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S5	As a result of our analysis, we consider our remaining development milestones under all of our license and collaboration agreements to be substantive and, accordingly, we expect to recognize as revenue future payments received from each milestone only if and as such milestone is achieved.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S6	Our license and collaboration agreements with certain partners also provide for contingent payments to us based solely upon the performance of the respective partner.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S7	For such contingent amounts, we expect to recognize the payments as revenue when earned under the applicable contract, which is generally upon completion of performance by the respective partner, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S8	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners also provide for payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales volumes of approved drugs.
906709_16_ITEM8_P28_S9	We consider these payments to be similar to royalty payments and we will recognize such sales-based payments upon achievement of such sales volumes, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs We recognize costs related to shipping and handling of product to customers in cost of goods sold.
906709_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Research and Development Expense Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits and other operating costs such as outside services, supplies and allocated overhead costs.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	We perform research and development for our proprietary drug candidates and technology development and for certain third parties under collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	For our proprietary drug candidates and our internal technology development programs, we invest our own funds without reimbursement from a third party.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical trial activities performed by third parties.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S3	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S4	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients, and completion of certain clinical trial activities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S5	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical trials ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S6	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical trials based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the trials.
906709_16_ITEM8_P30_S7	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period identified. .
906709_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock option grants and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), through which employees may purchase our common stock at a discount to the market price.
906709_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of the option on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and the estimated fair value of common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The Black- Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	Be cause our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-bas ed compensation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P35_S4	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination.
906709_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	We expense the value of the portion of the option or award that is ultimately expected to vest based on the historical forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	For awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP is recognized over the respective six-month purchase period.
906709_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	Expense amounts are recorded in cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense based on the function of the applicable employee.
906709_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Stock-based compensation charges are non-cash charges and as such have no impact on our reported cash flows.
906709_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
906709_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	For all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the net loss available to common stockholders is equal to the reported net loss.
906709_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same due to our historical net losses and the requirement to exclude potentially dilutive securities which would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.
906709_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	During 2015, 2014 and 2013, potentially dilutive securities consisted of common shares underlying outstanding stock options and restricted stock unit awards (RSUs).
906709_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	There were weighted average outstanding stock options and RSUs of 21.1 million, 21.9 million and 20.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method.
906709_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
906709_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
906709_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.
906709_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	We utilize a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions.
906709_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
906709_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Comprehensive loss Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity (deficit) from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.
906709_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Our other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net loss, gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of the assets and liabilities of our India and UK subsidiaries, and unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , and is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
906709_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this new guidance.
906709_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	We are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606.
906709_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability.
906709_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	This guidance is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2016 and early adoption is permitted.
906709_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	Upon adoption, the new guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
906709_16_ITEM8_P48_S3	We do not believe the adoption of this guid ance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	Note 2 Cash and Investments in Marketable Securities Cash and investments in marketable securities, including cash equivalents and restricted cash, are as follows (in thousands).
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	We invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S2	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in securities with maturities of two years or less and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S3	As December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of our investments had maturities of one year or less.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S4	Gross unrealized gains and losses were not significant at either December 31, 2015 or 2014.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we sold available-for-sale securities totaling $42.5 million, $21.7 million, and $2.9 million, respectively, and realized gains and losses were not significant in any of those periods.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S6	Restricted cash of $25.0 million was required to be maintained in a separate account until July 1, 2015 under the terms of our 12% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S7	This restriction expired on July 1, 2015 and the restricted funds were returned to us.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S8	Under the terms of our 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020, we are required to maintain a minimum cash and investments in marketable securities balance of $60.0 million during the term of the notes.
906709_16_ITEM8_P50_S9	Our portfolio of cash and investments in marketable securities includes (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	All of our investments are categorized as Level 1 or Level 2, as explained in the table above.
906709_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
906709_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had letter of credit arrangements in favor of a landlord and certain vendors totaling $2.4 million.
906709_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	These letters of credit are secured by investments of similar amounts.
906709_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Note 3 Inventory Inventory consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Note 4 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	Building and leasehold improvements include our manufacturing, research and development and administrative facilities and the related improvements to these facilities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	Laboratory and manufacturing equipment include assets that support both our manufacturing and research and development efforts.
906709_16_ITEM8_P58_S2	Construction-in-progress includes assets being built to enhance our manufacturing and research and development efforts, including manufacturing equipment supporting our Amikacin Inhale program at third-party contract manufacturing locations in the U.S. and Germany.
906709_16_ITEM8_P58_S3	Under the terms of our arrangement with certain of these contract manufacturers, during the period the equipment is being constructed, we are obligated to pay for their costs incurred to date.
906709_16_ITEM8_P58_S4	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have recorded a total of $4.3 million and $7.2 million, respectively, in other current and other long-term liabilities related to our obligation to purchase this equipment, which is recorded in property, plant and equipment.
906709_16_ITEM8_P58_S5	After the assets are placed into service, this liability is recorded as a capital lease liability and will be paid over approximately three years.
906709_16_ITEM8_P58_S6	Depreciation expense, including depreciation of assets acquired through capital leases, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $11.4 million, $11.7 million, and $13.0 million, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Note 5 Senior Secured Notes On September 30, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement with TC Lending, LLC and TAO Fund, LLC for the sale of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due 2020 (the Notes ).
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	On October 5, 2015, we completed the sale and issuance of the Notes.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S4	Interest is calculated based on actual days outstanding over a 360 day year.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S5	The Notes will mature on October 5, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal will be due and payable.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S6	In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we paid fees and expenses of $8.9 million, of which $8.3 million of transaction and facility fees paid directly to the purchasers of the Notes were capitalized as a debt discount and recorded as a reduction to the senior secured notes, net liability balance in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S7	An additional $0.4 million of direct issuance costs was capitalized and recorded in Other Assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and $0.2 million of fees were expensed.
906709_16_ITEM8_P59_S8	These debt discount and issuance costs will be amortized to interest expense over the five year term of the Notes.
906709_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	On October 5, 2015, we used a por tion of the proceeds from the Notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due in 2017 (12% Notes) .
906709_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	In addition, on October 5, 2015, we paid $3.3 million of accrued interest on the 12% Notes and made a $1 2 .
906709_16_ITEM8_P60_S2	5 million redemption payment, which includes $1.2 million of additional interest paid to the note holders at redemption.
906709_16_ITEM8_P60_S3	As a result , we received $100.
906709_16_ITEM8_P60_S4	3 million in net proceeds in connection with these transactions .
906709_16_ITEM8_P60_S5	In addition, as a result of these transactions, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of our 12% N otes, which consists of the $11.3 million redemption premium and $1.2 million of incremental interest paid to the note holders and the write -off of $1.6 million of unamortized issuance costs .
906709_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The agreement, pursuant to which the Notes were issued, contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, declare or pay dividends, redeem stock, issue preferred stock, make certain investments, merge or consolidate, make dispositions of assets, or enter into certain new businesses or transactions with affiliates, but do not contain covenants related to future financial performance.
906709_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	In particular, the Notes agreement requires us to maintain a minimum cash and investments in marketable securities balance of $60.0 million during the term of the Notes.
906709_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	The agreement also required that $50.0 million of the proceeds received from the issuance of the Notes be maintained in a restricted account until all liens securing the 12% Notes were released and all liens were released in November 2015 and the restrictions on this amount were removed.
906709_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Notes agreement provides that, beginning on October 5, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the Notes, subject to certain prepayment premiums and conditions.
906709_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	If we experience certain change of control events, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	In addition, upon certain asset sales, we may be required to offer to use the net proceeds thereof to purchase some of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	As of December 31, 2015, given that the Notes were recently issued in October 2015 and based on a discounted cash flow analysis using Level 3 inputs including financial discount rates, we believe the $250.0 million in principal amount of the Notes is consistent with its fair value.
906709_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	We lease office space at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California under a capital lease arrangement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	Under the terms of the lease, rent increases up to 3% annually and the lease termination date is October 5, 2016.
906709_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	As of November 29, 2010, we ceased use of this space as a result of the relocation of our San Carlos operations and corporate headquarters to San Francisco, California.
906709_16_ITEM8_P63_S3	As of April 2013, we had subleased all of the San Carlos facility and our future minimum rental receipts under these subleases total $2.1 million as of December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	In addition to our San Carlos capital lease, we have purchased certain manufacturing equipment under capital leases.
906709_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the gross amount of assets recorded under capital leases was $5.1 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and the recorded value of these assets, net of depreciation, was $3.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	Future minimum payments for our capital leases at December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	Operating Lease On September 30, 2009, we entered into an operating sublease (Sublease) with Pfizer, Inc. for a 126,285 square foot facility located in San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility).
906709_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	Under the terms of the Sublease, we began making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014, after the expiration of our free rent period on August 1, 2014.
906709_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	The Sublease term is 114 months, commencing in August 2010 and terminating on January 31, 2020.
906709_16_ITEM8_P65_S3	Monthly base rent will escalate over the term of the sublease at various intervals.
906709_16_ITEM8_P65_S4	In addition, throughout the term of the Sublease, we are responsible for paying certain costs and expenses specified in the Sublease, including insurance costs and a pro rata share of operating expenses and applicable taxes for the Mission Bay Facility.
906709_16_ITEM8_P65_S5	Our future minimum lease payments for our operating leases at December 31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
906709_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, rent expense for all of our operating leases, which primarily consists of our Mission Bay Facility, was approximately $3.2 million, $3.2 million, and $2.9 million, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had total deferred rent balances of $8.5 million and $8.7 million, respectively, which are recorded in other current and other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
906709_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	Note 7 Liability Related to the Sale of Future Royalties On February 24, 2012, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with RPI Finance Trust (RPI), an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, pursuant to which we sold, and RPI purchased, our right to receive royalty payments (the Royalty Entitlement) arising from the worldwide net sales, from and after January 1, 2012, of (a) CIMZIA , under our license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB), and (b) MIRCERA , under our license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together referred to as Roche).
906709_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	We received aggregate cash proceeds of $124.0 million for the Royalty Entitlement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs, which will be amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	Although we sold all of our rights to receive royalties from the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, as a result of our ongoing manufacturing and supply obligations related to the generation of these royalties, we will continue to account for these royalties as revenue and recorded the $124.0 million in proceeds from this transaction as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that will be amortized using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P67_S4	The following table shows the activity within the liability account during the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period from the inception of the royalty transaction on February 24, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2015 (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in March 2014 and March 2013, we were required to pay RPI $7.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, as a result of worldwide net sales of MIRCERA for the 12 month periods ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 not reaching certain minimum thresholds.
906709_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Purchase and Sale Agreement does not include any other potential payments related to minimum net sales thresholds and, therefore, we do not expect to make any further payments to RPI related to this agreement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to RPI, we will continue to recognize revenue for these royalties.
906709_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $ 22.1 million, $21.9 million, and $22.1 million, respectively, in non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA and we recorded $20.6 million, $20.9 million and $22.3 million, respectively, of related non-cash interest expense.
906709_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	As royalties are remitted to RPI from Roche and UCB, the balance of the Royalty Obligation will be effectively repaid over the life of the agreement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P69_S3	In order to determine the amortization of the Royalty Obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by RPI and payments we are required to make to RPI as noted above over the life of the agreement.
906709_16_ITEM8_P69_S4	The sum of these amounts less the $124.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P69_S5	Since inception, our estimate of this total interest expense resulted in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 17%.
906709_16_ITEM8_P69_S6	We periodically assess the estimated royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche and to the extent the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are made in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are more than expected, the non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense recorded by us would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P70_S3	In addition, the Purchase and Sale Agreement grants RPI the right to receive certain reports and other information relating to the Royalty Entitlement and contains other representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations that are customary for a transaction of this nature.
906709_16_ITEM8_P70_S4	To our knowledge, we are currently in compliance with these provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement; however, if we were to breach our obligations, we could be required to pay damages to RPI that are not limited to the purchase price we received in the sale transaction.
906709_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies Royalty Expense We have third party licenses that require us to pay royalties based on our sales of certain products and/or on our recognition of royalty revenue under certain of our collaboration agreements.
906709_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Royalty expense, which is reflected in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was approximately $2.8 million, $3.4 million, and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	The overall maximum amount of these obligations is based upon sales of the applicable products by our collaboration partners and cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	In the normal course of business, we enter into various firm purchase commitments related to contract manufacturing, clinical development and certain other items.
906709_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	As of December 31, 2015, these commitments were approximately $5.4 million, all of which are expected to be paid in 2016.
906709_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
906709_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
906709_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	Such provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
906709_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	If any unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of our operations of that period and on our cash flows and liquidity.
906709_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	On August 14, 2015, Enzon, Inc. filed a breach of contract complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Court) claiming damages of $1.5 million (plus interest) for unpaid licensing fees through the date of the complaint.
906709_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	Enzon alleged that we failed to pay a post-patent expiration immunity fee related to one of the licenses.
906709_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	Following a hearing held on December 21, 2015, the Court granted Nektar s motion to dismiss the Enzon complaint.
906709_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	Enzon has stated that it currently intends to appeal this dismissal.
906709_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Foreign Operations We operate in a number of foreign countries.
906709_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous local laws and regulations that can result in claims made by foreign government agencies or other third parties that are often difficult to predict even after the application of good faith compliance efforts.
906709_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	During the course of our normal operating activities, we have agreed to certain contingent indemnification obligations as further described below.
906709_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	The term of our indemnification obligations is generally perpetual.
906709_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	There is generally no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P78_S3	To date, we have not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims based on our indemnification obligations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P78_S4	If any of our indemnification obligations is triggered, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	Because the aggregate amount of any potential indemnification obligation is not a stated amount, the overall maximum amount of any such obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	No liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 or 2014.
906709_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Indemnifications in Connection with Commercial Agreements As part of our collaboration agreements with our partners related to the license, development, manufacture and supply of drugs based on our proprietary technologies and drug candidates, we generally agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our partners from and against third party liabilities arising out of the agreement, including product liability (with respect to our activities) and infringement of intellectual property to the extent the intellectual property is developed by us and licensed to our partners.
906709_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	As part of the sale of our royalty interest in the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, we and RPI made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by indemnity obligations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	Additionally, as part of our pulmonary asset sale to Novartis in 2008, we and Novartis made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by an indemnity obligation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P80_S3	In the event it is determined that we breached certain of the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements made by us in any such agreements, we could incur substantial indemnification liabilities depending on the timing, nature, and amount of any such claims.
906709_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Indemnification of Underwriters and Initial Purchasers of our Securities In connection with our sale of equity and senior secured debt securities, we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our underwriters or initial purchasers, as applicable, as well as certain related parties from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
906709_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	Director and Officer Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, we indemnify our directors, executive officers, other officers, employees, and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity.
906709_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, we have insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
906709_16_ITEM8_P81_S3	Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1.5 million per incident for merger and acquisition related claims, $1.0 million per incident for securities related claims and $0.5 million per incident for non-securities related claims retention deductible per our insurance policy.
906709_16_ITEM8_P81_S4	However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	We have authorized 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with each share having a par value of $0.0001.
906709_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, no preferred shares are designated, issued or outstanding.

906709_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	In addition, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other costs in connection with this offering.
906709_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	At December 31, 2015, we had 27,744,597 reserved shares of common stock, all of which are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans as summarized in the following table (share numbers in thousands):

906709_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	On the date of approval, any shares of our common stock that were available for issuance under all other previously existing stock plans (the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, and the 2000 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan) became available for issuance under the 2012 Plan.
906709_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	In addition, 5,300,000 new shares were made available for award grants under the 2012 Plan.

906709_16_ITEM8_P86_S5	On June 16, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2012 Plan whereby 7,000,000 additional shares were made available for award grants under the 2012 Plan.
906709_16_ITEM8_P86_S6	The purpose of the 2012 Plan and our other incentive plans is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward directors, officers, employees, and other eligible persons through the grant of awards and incentives for high levels of individual performance and increasing the value of our business, as well as to further align the interests of award recipients and our stockholders.
906709_16_ITEM8_P86_S7	The 2012 Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, stock bonuses, dividend equivalents, other similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, and other forms of awards granted or denominated in our common stock or units of the Company s common stock, as well as cash bonus awards.
906709_16_ITEM8_P86_S8	Directors, officers, or employees, and certain consultants and advisors may receive awards under the 2012 Plan.
906709_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Pursuant to the 2012 Plan, we granted or issued incentive stock options to officers and non-qualified stock options and RSUs to employees, officers, and non-employee directors.
906709_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	The requisite service period for stock options granted to our employees under the 2012 Plan as well as all other previously existing stock plans is generally four years; the requisite service period for stock options granted to our directors is generally one year.
906709_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we granted RSUs to employees, officers and non-employees directors.
906709_16_ITEM8_P87_S3	No RSUs were granted during 2014 or 2013.
906709_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	The requisite service period for RSUs granted under the 2012 Plan is generally three years for employees and one year for directors.
906709_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	The maximum number of shares of our common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to awards under the 2012 Plan is 19,936,433 shares, plus any shares subject to outstanding awards under the previous stock plans that expire, are cancelled, or otherwise terminate for any reason.
906709_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	Generally, shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason (except for shares exchanged by a participant or withheld to pay the exercise price of an award granted and related tax withholding obligations) are not paid or delivered under the 2012 Plan will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2012 Plan.
906709_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	Shares issued in respect of any award, other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, granted under the 2012 Plan will be counted against the plan s share limit as 1.5 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award.
906709_16_ITEM8_P89_S3	The 2012 Plan will terminate on April 3, 2022, unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors.
906709_16_ITEM8_P89_S4	The maximum term of a stock option or stock appreciation right under the 2012 Plan is eight years from the date of grant.
906709_16_ITEM8_P89_S5	The per share exercise price of an option generally may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.
906709_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	In addition to the 2012 Plan, we have other equity incentive plans under which options granted remain outstanding but no new options may be granted either as a result of the approval of the 2012 Plan or plan expiration.
906709_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	These plans include: (i) the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (2008 Plan) which was adopted by the Board of Directors on March 20, 2008 and approved by our stockholders on June 6, 2008; (ii) the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) which was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 19, 2000 by amending and restating our 1994 Equity Incentive Plan, and which expired on February 9, 2010; and (iii) the 1998 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan which was adopted by our Board of Directors on August 18, 1998, and which was amended and restated in its entirety and renamed the 2000 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan on June 6, 2000 (2000 Non-Officer Plan).

906709_16_ITEM8_P123_S5	Certain of the RSUs granted in 2015 vest upon achievement of pre-determined performance milestones, while the rest of the RSUs have a time-based vesting schedule.
906709_16_ITEM8_P123_S6	We expense the grant date fair value of the RSUs expected to vest ratably over the expected service or performance period.

906709_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	Note 12 Income Taxes Loss before provision (benefit) for income taxes includes the following components (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	The foreign benefit provision in the year ended December 31, 2014 is due to the reduction in taxes related to a favorable determination received from India proceedings.
906709_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	Income tax provision related to continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax loss as follows (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
906709_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	Significant components of our deferred tax assets for federal and state income taxes are as follows (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	Because of our lack of U.S. earnings history, the net U.S. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
906709_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	The valuation allowance increased by $17.3 million and $9.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
906709_16_ITEM8_P130_S3	The valuation allowance includes approximately $35.6 million of income tax benefit at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 related to stock-based compensation and exercises prior to the implementation of the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation that will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized.
906709_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in India are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly, no deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
906709_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income tax.
906709_16_ITEM8_P131_S2	As of December 31, 2015, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $4.4 million of such earnings.
906709_16_ITEM8_P131_S3	Any incremental tax liability would be insignificant due to foreign tax credits that would be realized upon distribution.
906709_16_ITEM8_P131_S4	As of December 31, 2015, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,223.6 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2018.
906709_16_ITEM8_P131_S5	As of December 31, 2015, we had a total state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $489.6 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2016.
906709_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
906709_16_ITEM8_P132_S1	We have federal research credits of approximately $45.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2019 and state research credits of approximately $24.6 million which have no expiration date.
906709_16_ITEM8_P132_S2	We have federal orphan drug credits of $17.7 million which will begin to expire in 2026.
906709_16_ITEM8_P132_S3	These tax credits are subject to the same limitations discussed above.
906709_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits We have incurred net operating losses since inception.
906709_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
906709_16_ITEM8_P133_S2	If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our effective tax rate may be reduced.
906709_16_ITEM8_P133_S3	We currently have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
906709_16_ITEM8_P133_S4	Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.
906709_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	The decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits primarily relates to a recent California Supreme Court decision relating to the calculation of apportionment of income.
906709_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Alabama, and India.
906709_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	Because of net operating losses and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our domestic tax years r emain open and subject to examination.
906709_16_ITEM8_P135_S2	We are currently under examination in India for the fiscal years ending 2009 through 2015 .
906709_16_ITEM8_P135_S3	We have the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
906709_16_ITEM8_P136_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant interest or penalties were recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	We operate in one business segment which focuses on applying our technology platforms to improve the performance of established and novel medicines.
906709_16_ITEM8_P137_S1	We operate in one segment because our business offerings have similar economics and other characteristics, including the nature of products and manufacturing processes, types of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment.
906709_16_ITEM8_P137_S2	We are comprehensively managed as one business segment by our Chief Executive Officer and his management team.
906709_16_ITEM8_P137_S3	Our revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
906709_16_ITEM8_P137_S4	AstraZeneca and UCB represented 57% and 13% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM8_P137_S5	Revenue from AstraZeneca, UCB and Roche represented 52%, 16% and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_16_ITEM8_P137_S6	Revenue from Roche, UCB, AstraZeneca and Bayer represented 28%, 21%, 17% and 10% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013.
906709_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	At December 31, 2015, $54.2 million, or approximately 76%, of the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was located in the United States, $11.1 million, or approximately 16% was located at contract manufacturers in Germany and the Netherlands, and $6.0 million, or approximately 8%, was located in India.
906709_16_ITEM8_P139_S1	At December 31, 2014, $53.3 million, or approximately 76%, of the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was located in the United States, $10.4 million, or approximately 14% was located at contract manufacturers in Germany and the Netherlands, and $6.7 million, or approximately 10%, was located in India.
906709_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data.
906709_16_ITEM8_P140_S1	In our opinion, the unaudited information set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as our audited information and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth herein.
906709_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results and expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
906709_16_ITEM8_P141_S1	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
906709_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	Such reclassifications have not materially impacted previously reported total revenues, operating loss or net loss.
906709_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	All data is in thousands except per share information.
906709_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	Quarterly loss per share amounts may not total to the year-to-date loss per share due to rounding.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
906709_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 has been audited by Ernst Young, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P5_S2	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P5_S4	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P6_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_16_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
906709_16_ITEM10_P0_S0	Information relating to our executive officers required by this item is set forth in Part I Item 1 of this report under the caption Executive Officers of the Registrant and is incorporated herein by reference.

906709_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	Upon initial appointment to the Board of Directors, each Non-Employee Director shall be awarded equity compensation composed of stock options and/or restricted stock units under the Company s equity incentive plans.
906709_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	This initial appointment equity compensation award will be based on one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the annual equity compensation grant, as determined annually by the Board of Directors in consultation with its professional advisors.
906709_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	In September of each year, each Non-Employee Director shall be awarded equity compensation composed of stock options and/or restricted stock units under the Company s equity incentive plans.
906709_16_ITEM15_P84_S1	This annual equity compensation award will be based on a review of equity compensation for non-employee directors of comparable companies as determined by the Board of Directors in consultation with its professional advisors.
906709_16_ITEM15_P84_S2	For purposes of the foregoing, the value of stock options will be determined based on the Black-Scholes valuation methodology and the value of restricted stock units will be based on the value of the Company s common stock on the grant date.
906709_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	Non-Employee Directors are also eligible for discretionary grants of options or restricted stock units under the Company s equity incentive plans.
906709_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	Options granted to a Non-Employee Director for their annual service on the Board of Directors shall vest monthly over a period of one year.

906709_16_ITEM15_P87_S6	All restricted stock units that are awarded under this Plan may only be delivered to the non-employee director upon either the earlier of (i) the completion of the entire vesting period to which the restricted stock unit award relates, or (ii) the termination of the Non-Employee Director s service, and in no event at any earlier date or upon the election or request of a Non-Employee Director at any other alternative date.
906709_16_ITEM15_P87_S7	In the event of a change of control, the vesting of each option or restricted stock unit award shall accelerate in full as of the closing of such transaction.
906709_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	Ownership Guidelines The Board of Directors of the Company believes that Non-Employee Directors should own and hold common stock of the Company to further align their interests and actions with the interests of the Company s stockholders.
906709_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	Non-Employee Directors of the Company should own shares of Nektar s common stock equivalent to at least three times the value of the Annual Retainer.
906709_16_ITEM15_P88_S2	The minimum stock ownership level should be achieved by each Non-Employee Director by January 1, 2015 or within five years of his or her first appointment to the Board of Directors.
906709_16_ITEM15_P88_S3	Any change in the value of the stock (such as a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, etc.) will not affect the amount of stock Non-Employee Directors must hold.
906709_16_ITEM15_P88_S4	Once achieved, ownership of the guideline amount should be maintained as long as the Non-Employee Director retains his or her seat on the Board.
906709_16_ITEM15_P88_S5	Stock that counts towards satisfaction of these guidelines include:
906709_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	Other equity vehicles such as deferred stock units that may be implemented from time to time.
906709_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	There may be rare instances where these guidelines would place a severe hardship on a Non-Employee Director.
906709_16_ITEM15_P90_S1	In these cases, the Board will make the final decision as to developing an alternative stock ownership guideline for a Non-Employee Director that reflects the intention of these guidelines and his or her personal circumstances.

906709_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops innovative medicines in areas of high unmet medical need.
906709_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, auto-immune disease and chronic pain.
906709_17_ITEM1_P0_S2	We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1_P0_S3	These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_17_ITEM1_P0_S4	We refer to our drug candidates where we retain at least U.S. commercial rights as proprietary programs and our other drug candidate programs that we have licensed U.S. and potentially other commercial rights to collaboration partners as collaboration partner programs.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	In the area of I-O, we are developing medicines that target biological pathways which stimulate and sustain the body s immune response in order to fight cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S1	We are developing medicines designed to directly or indirectly modulate the activity of key immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells, to increase their numbers and improve their function to recognize and attack cancer cells.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S2	NKTR-214, our lead I-O candidate, is a biologic with biased signaling through one of the IL-2 receptor subunits (CD 122) that can stimulate proliferation and growth of tumor-killing immune cells in the tumor micro-environment and increase expression of PD-1 on these immune cells.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S3	A Phase 1 trial for NKTR-214 as a single-agent in cancer patients with solid tumors has completed recruitment.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S4	meeting in November 2016 and the ASCO-GU meeting in February 2017.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S5	On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (BMS Agreement) with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating NKTR-214 and BMS human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo (nivolumab), as a potential combination treatment regimen in five tumor types and eight potential indications, and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a Combined Therapy Trial).
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S6	Under the BMS Agreement, BMS will supply nivolumab and be responsible for 50% of all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection with the Combined Therapy Trials.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S7	The first stage of the large Phase 1/2 clinical program for NKTR-214 is underway with BMS and is evaluating a potential combination treatment regimen of NKTR-214 with BMS PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo in up to 260 patients.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S8	This clinical program will explore eight potential indications in five solid tumor types: melanoma, kidney, triple-negative breast cancer, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P1_S9	In addition to the clinical program in collaboration with BMS, we also plan to initiate a broad clinical development program, both on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining NKTR-214 with therapies such as cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, small molecules, and other biological agents in order to generate novel immune-oncology approaches.
906709_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body.
906709_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	NKTR-262 is designed to stimulate the innate immune system and promote maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells.
906709_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	NKTR-262 is being developed as a single intra-tumoral injection in combination with systemic NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	NKTR-262 is currently advancing through preclinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	NKTR-255 is a biologic that targets the interleukin-15 pathway in order to activate the body s innate and adaptive immunity.
906709_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Signaling of the IL-15 pathway induces the proliferation and growth of CD8 memory T cells so the body s immune system retains the ability to identify cancer cells if they re-grow in the body.
906709_17_ITEM1_P3_S2	NKTR-255 has also been shown to stimulate NK cell development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P3_S3	NKTR-255 is currently advancing through preclinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P3_S4	Immunology We are developing a new biologic, NKTR-358, which is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body which occurs in patients with auto-immune disease.
906709_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	The breakdown of mechanisms assuring recognition of self and non-self is what underlies all autoimmune diseases.
906709_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	By increasing the number of T regulatory cells (which are specific immune cells in the body that modul ate the immune system and prevent auto-immune disease by maintaining self-tolerance), these pathogenic auto reactive T cells can be reduced and the proper balance of effector and regulatory T cells can be achieved to restore the body's self-tolerance mecha nisms.
906709_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	There is consistent evidence that suboptimal T regulatory cell numbers and their lack of activity play a significant role in a myriad of autoimmune diseases.
906709_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	NKTR-358 is designed to optimally target the IL-2 receptor complex in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of T regulatory cells.
906709_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	NKTR-358 is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of auto-immune diseases.
906709_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	In 2017, clinical trials are planned for NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers and patients with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and other indications.
906709_17_ITEM1_P8_S2	We submitted an IND for NKTR-358 with the FDA in February 2017.
906709_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Pain - NKTR-181 NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions and is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	We enrolled the first patient in the first Phase 3 efficacy study, which we call SUMMIT-07 in February 2015 and we completed enrollment in the study in late 2016.
906709_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	We are now conducting blinded data verification activities and currently plan to un-blind and announce the top-line data from SUMMIT-07 in March 2017.
906709_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	In this study, we randomized patients with chronic low back pain in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which included a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 is given to all patients, followed by a 12-week double-blind randomized period where subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	In 2016, we increased the sample size of this trial by approximately 200 patients following a pre-specified sample size assessment by the independent analysis center (IAC) after approximately fifty percent of the initially planned 416 patients completed the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	In 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181 dose levels that were included in SUMMIT-07.
906709_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower drug liking scores and reduced feeling high scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_17_ITEM1_P11_S2	In January 2017, we started enrollment in a second HAL study where we are assessing abuse liability of supra-therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in order to further evaluate NKTR-181 for labeling and scheduling purposes.
906709_17_ITEM1_P11_S3	The Phase 3 program for NKTR-181 is anticipated to also include a Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial in people who are opioid-experienced.
906709_17_ITEM1_P11_S4	If the top-line data from the SUMMIT-07 study is positive, we plan to seek a collaboration partner for this program to support further development investments and commercialize NKTR-181.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Oncology - ONZEALD TM ONZEALD TM (also known as NKTR-102, etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	On March 17, 2015, we announced topline data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALD TM , which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S2	The BEACON study compared ONZEALD TM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S3	In a topline analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALD TM provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALD TM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S4	Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the ONZEALD TM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S5	Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S6	We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroup populations patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S7	We have explored future regulatory and development paths forward for ONZEALD TM with the EU and U.S. health authorities.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S8	In Europe, we met with the National Authorities in Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss the BEACON data.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S9	In June 2016, we filed an MAA for conditional approval of ONZEALD TM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S10	On July 14, 2016, we received a letter from the EMA notifying us that the ONZEALD TM MAA successfully passed validation to be accepted for review.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S11	(Daiichi Europe) and in connection with MAA filing for ONZEALD TM , in the fourth quarter of 2016 we initiated a randomized Phase 3 confirmatory study to evaluate ONZEALD TM as compared to treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in approximately 350 adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases, which we call the ATTAIN study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S12	The primary endpoint of the ATTAIN study will be overall survival (OS) and the ATTAIN study will include a pre-specified interim analysis for OS which is to be conducted after 130 events have occurred in the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P12_S13	In addition, based on our meetings with the FDA s Oncology Division, the FDA staff has indicated that positive results from the ATTAIN study could potentially support a New Drug Application (NDA) filing in the U.S. where Nektar has retained all rights to ONZEALD TM .
906709_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	Collaboration Partner Programs In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK (naloxegol), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca).
906709_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	MOVANTIK is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, a side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines.
906709_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	AstraZeneca markets and sells MOVANTIK in the United States in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (Daiichi).
906709_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kirin) has exclusive marketing rights to MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the EU) in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
906709_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	We have a collaboration with Baxalta Incorporated, (a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of Shire plc) to develop and commercialize PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	Under this collaboration, we worked with Baxalta to develop ADYNOVATE (previously referred to as BAX 855), an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for Hemophilia A based on ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)].
906709_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	In November 2015, ADYNOVATE was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. Baxalta announced the launch and first shipments of ADYNOVATE in the U.S. on November 30, 2015.
906709_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	On April 4, 2016, Baxalta announced that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan approved ADYNOVATE for patients aged 12 years and older with Hemophilia A. On December 27, 2016, Shire plc announced that the FDA approved ADYNOVATE for use in surgical settings for both adult and pediatric patients and the FDA also approved ADYNOVATE for the treatment for Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.
906709_17_ITEM1_P15_S6	ADYNOVATE is also under regulatory review in the European Union, Switzerland and Canada.
906709_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	We also have two significant drug development programs with Bayer Healthcare LLC (Bayer).
906709_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	The first is a collaboration to develop BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale, formerly known as NKTR-061), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic.
906709_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	We originally developed the liquid aerosol inhalation platform and the NKTR-061 drug candidate and entered into a collaboration agreement with Bayer to further advance the drug candidate s development and potential commercialization.
906709_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	Bayer is currently enrolling patients in a Phase 3 clinical study for Amikacin Inhale.
906709_17_ITEM1_P16_S4	Bayer is conducting this study under a Special Protocol Assessment process agreed to with the FDA.
906709_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	The second program is the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG (Bayer Schering) that we transferred to Novartis as part of the 2008 pulmonary asset divestiture transaction.
906709_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	In August 2012, Bayer Schering initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	In September 2016, Bayer Schering presented data from the first Phase 3 trail (RESPIRE 1) at the 2016 European Respiratory Society Annual Meeting which showed that the study met its co-primary endpoints for the every 14-day dosing arm of Cipro DPI.
906709_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	The second Phase 3 trial (RESPIRE 2) completed recruitment in September 2016 and Bayer Schering has not yet reported the results from RESPIRE 2.
906709_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	We have a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma for dapirolizumab pegol, a monovalent pegylated Fab antibody fragment against the CD40 ligand (CD40L), being developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for which the candidate is entering Phase 2 development with UCB partner Biogen.
906709_17_ITEM1_P17_S5	We also have a number of license, manufacturing and supply agreements with other leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen Inc., Allergan, Inc., Opthotech Corporation (Fovista), Merck Co., Inc., Pfizer, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche).
906709_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	A total of ten products using our PEGylation technology have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or EU.
906709_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	There are also a number of other products in clinical development that incorporate our advanced polymer conjugate technologies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	We were incorporated in California in 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998.
906709_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	We maintain our executive offices at 455 Mission Bay Boulevard South, San Francisco, California 94158, and our main telephone number is (415) 482-5300.
906709_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	Our website is located at www.nektar.com.
906709_17_ITEM1_P19_S3	The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of, and is not incorporated in, this Annual Report.
906709_17_ITEM1_P19_S4	Our Technology Platform As a leader in the polymer conjugation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules including many classes of drugs targeting numerous disease areas.
906709_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Polymer conjugation or PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Roche s PEGASYS (PEG-interferon alfa-2a).
906709_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body.
906709_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics.
906709_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	For example, these techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from t he application of the technology.
906709_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in polymer conjugation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
906709_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
906709_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates Our customized approach for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_17_ITEM1_P26_S1	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_17_ITEM1_P26_S2	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_17_ITEM1_P26_S3	An example of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is MOVANTIK , an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that is approved in the United States and European Union.
906709_17_ITEM1_P26_S4	An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile.
906709_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy.
906709_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_17_ITEM1_P27_S3	We are using this approach with our lead oncolytic drug candidate, ONZEALD TM next-generation topoisomerase I-inhibitor currently in Phase 3 clinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity.
906709_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	An example of this is Baxalta s ADYNOVATE , a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A.
906709_17_ITEM1_P28_S4	In December 2016, Shire plc announced the FDA approved ADYNOVATE for use in surgical settings for both adults and pediatric patients, and that the FDA also approved ADYNOVATE for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.
906709_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	More recently, our scientists have shown that we can also optimize relative receptor binding characteristics of large molecule conjugates.
906709_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	For instance, the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has two different receptor complexes in the body that cause opposing effects on the immune system.
906709_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	We have engineered different novel conjugates of IL-2 with optimized differential receptor binding to the IL-2 receptor categories in the immune system.
906709_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	By biasing the receptor binding of these molecules in complementary ways, we have made two different drug candidates: NKTR-214, which selectively activates effector T-cells, which kill tumors; and NKTR-358, which selectively activates regulatory T-cells, which can reduce the pathological immune activation that underlies many autoimmune diseases.
906709_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have expanded to include a new approach with biologics, in particular cytokines, which utilizes the polymer as a means to bias action to a certain receptor or receptor sub-type.
906709_17_ITEM1_P29_S5	In addition, a cytokine s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_17_ITEM1_P29_S6	An example of this is NKTR-214, which is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine with an every two or every three-week dosing schedule.
906709_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and EU.
906709_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	To support this strategy, we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of existing drugs and drug candidates as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_17_ITEM1_P33_S3	We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_17_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_17_ITEM1_P33_S5	We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	Enter int o Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.
906709_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	The following table summarizes our proprietary drugs and drug candidates that have either received regulatory approval or are being developed by us or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies or independent investigators.
906709_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	The table includes the type of molecule or drug, the target indications for the drug candidate, and the status of the clinical development program.
906709_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	Phase 3 or Pivotal product in large-scale clinical trials conducted to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell the drug (these trials are typically initiated following encouraging Phase 2 trial results).
906709_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Phase 2 a drug candidate in clinical trials to establish dosing and efficacy in patients.
906709_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Phase 1 a drug candidate in clinical trials, typically in healthy subjects, to test safety.
906709_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	NKTR-214 is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine designed for the treatment of solid tumors.
906709_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	NKTR-214 is designed to preferentially activate the IL-2 beta sub-receptors and gamma sub-units of the IL-2 receptor in order to proliferate tumor-killing T cells within the body (CD8-positive effector T cells and natural killer T cells) without stimulating regulatory T cells (CD4-positive T cells).
906709_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	This receptor selectivity is intended to increase efficacy and improve safety over existing immunostimulatory cytokine drugs.
906709_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	In June 2015, we and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced a research collaboration that includes a Phase 1/2 clinical study to evaluate NKTR-214 in a variety of tumor types as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies, including PD-1 pathway inhibitors.
906709_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	In December 2015, we announced that dosing had commenced in the Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of NKTR-214 in patients with advanced solid tumors, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical study for NKTR-214, which is our engineered immunostimulatory CD122-biased cytokine designed to preferentially activate the beta and gamma sub-units of the IL-2 receptor with the objective to induce proliferation and accumulation of tumor-killing lymphocyte cells within the body (CD8-positive effector T cells and natural killer T cells) with limited activity on regulatory T cells (CD4-positive T cells).
906709_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	The study is being conducted initially at three primary investigator sites: the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Yale Cancer Center and the Providence Cancer Center in Portland, Oregon.
906709_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	The dose-escalation stage of the Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy, and define the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 in patients with solid tumors.
906709_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	In addition to a determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose, the study will assess the safety profile of NKTR-214, the immunologic effect of NKTR-214 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune activation markers in both blood and tumor tissue, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity based on objective response rate.
906709_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	We plan to study NKTR-214 in combination with a number of therapeutic approaches where we believe there is a strong biologic rationale for complimentary mechanisms of action.
906709_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (BMS Agreement) with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating NKTR-214 and BMS human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo (nivolumab), as a potential combination treatment regimen in five tumor types and eight potential indications, and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a Combined Therapy Trial).
906709_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	The dose escalation stage of the Phase 1/2 program evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo , which we call the PIVOT study is currently enrolling patients at multiple clinical sites.
906709_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	In the first phase of the PIVOT study, we expect to evaluate the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo in patients.
906709_17_ITEM1_P41_S6	The second phase of the expansion cohorts is expected to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo .
906709_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Under the BMS Agreement, BMS is responsible for 50% of all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection with third party contract research organization, laboratories, clinical sites and institutional review boards.
906709_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	Each party will otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combined Therapy Trial.
906709_17_ITEM1_P42_S2	Nektar and BMS will use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture and supply its compound for each Combined Therapy Trial and will bear the costs related thereto.
906709_17_ITEM1_P42_S3	In addition to the clinical trials in collaboration with BMS, we also plan to initiate a broad clinical development program, both on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining NKTR-214 with therapies such as cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, small molecules, and other biological agents in order to generate novel immune-oncology approaches.
906709_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	NKTR-262 NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body.
906709_17_ITEM1_P43_S1	NKTR-262 is designed to overcome the body s dysfunction of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells.
906709_17_ITEM1_P43_S2	NKTR-262 is being developed as a single intra-tumoral injection to be administered at the start of therapy with NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P43_S3	NKTR-262 is currently advancing through preclinical development with the objective of filing an IND and beginning clinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	NKTR-255 NKTR-255 is a memory T cell stimulating cytokine designed to engage the IL-15 pathway to induce long-term T cell activation and improve the quality of T cell memory response to treat cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	Through optimal engagement of the IL-15R /IL-2R receptor complex, NKTR-255 stimulates proliferation and survival of CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and enhances formation of long-term immunological memory which may lead to sustained anti-tumor immune response.
906709_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	body and must be administered frequently and in high doses limiting its utility due to toxicity.
906709_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	NKTR-255 is designed with IL-15 receptor alpha specificity to optimize biological a ctivity and is uniquely engineered to provide optimal exposure and an improved safety profile.
906709_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Immunology NKTR-358 is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body which occurs in patients with auto-immune disease.
906709_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Current systemic treatments for autoimmune disease, including corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents, suppress the immune system broadly and come with severe side effects.
906709_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	NKTR-358 targets the CD25 sub-receptor in the interleukin-2 pathway in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of T regulatory cells, which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent auto-immune disease by maintaining self-tolerance.
906709_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	We plan to evaluate NKTR-358 in clinical studies for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and other indications.
906709_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	We filed an IND for Nektar-358 in February 2017.
906709_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	NKTR-181 is an orally-available novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule in development as a long-acting analgesic to treat chronic pain.
906709_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	NKTR-181 is designed with the objective to address the abuse liability and serious central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with current opioid therapies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	NKTR-181 was created using Nektar s proprietary polymer conjugate technology, which provides it with a long-acting profile and slows its entry into the CNS.
906709_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	NKTR-181 s abuse deterrent properties are inherent to its novel molecular structure and do not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid.
906709_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	In May 2012, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the NKTR-181 development program.
906709_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	In June 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	The Phase 2 clinical study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, enriched enrollment study design.
906709_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	The study enrolled 295 opioid-na ve patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were not getting adequate pain relief from their current non-opioid pain medication.
906709_17_ITEM1_P50_S4	Patients who qualified during the baseline period entered a titration phase, during which they were titrated on NKTR-181 tablets administered orally twice-daily until a dose was reached that provided a reduction of at least 20% in the patient s pain score as compared to the patient s own baseline.
906709_17_ITEM1_P50_S5	Patients that achieved this level of analgesia were then randomized on a 1:1 basis to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive placebo for up to 25 days.
906709_17_ITEM1_P50_S6	The primary endpoint of the study was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181.
906709_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower "drug liking" scores and reduced "feeling high" scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	On June 19, 2013, we presented data from the HAL study at the 2013 Annual Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence in San Diego, California.
906709_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	On September 26, 2013, we announced results from this Phase 2 efficacy study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P52_S2	Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only 9 patients (representing 3% of the patient population) were unable to achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181.
906709_17_ITEM1_P52_S3	A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P52_S4	NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study with patients continuing to show a reduction in pain scores throughout the randomized phase of the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P52_S5	However, patients who were randomized to placebo did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P52_S6	This unusual lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint in the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	In October 2014, we engaged in an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA, which included discussions of the design of the Phase 3 clinical study program.
906709_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	We enrolled the first patient in the first Phase 3 efficacy study, which we call SUMMIT-07 in February 2015 and we completed enrollment in the study in the fourth quarter of 2016.
906709_17_ITEM1_P53_S2	In this study, we randomized patients with chronic low back pain in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which included a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 was given to all patients, followed by a 12-week double-blind randomized period where subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_17_ITEM1_P53_S3	On February 29, 2016, we increased the sample size of this trial by approximately 200 patients following a pre-specified sample size assessment by the independent analysis center (IAC) after approximately fifty percent of the initially planned 416 patients completed the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P53_S4	The protocol for the NKTR-181 study defined only two possible outcomes for this pre-planned blinded interim sample size assessment: (1) if the conditional powering at the midpoint of the trial fell between 50-85%, the sample size was to be increased by approximately 200 patients; or (2) if the conditional powering fell below 50%, or above 85%, the sample size was not to be changed.
906709_17_ITEM1_P53_S5	The IAC s determination was nondiscretionary and was based upon our determination of pre-defined acceptable power to detect a statistically significant difference between NKTR-181 and placebo based on the primary efficacy endpoint.
906709_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	In 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181 dose levels that were included in SUMMIT-07.
906709_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower drug liking scores and reduced feeling high scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	enrollment in a second HAL study where we are assessing abuse liability of supra-therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in order to further evaluate NKTR-181 for labeling and scheduling p urposes.
906709_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	The Phase 3 program for NKTR-181 is anticipated to also include a Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial in people who are opioid-experienced.
906709_17_ITEM1_P55_S2	We are now conducting blinded data verification activities and currently plan to un-blind and announce the top-line data from SUMMIT-07 in March 2017.
906709_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	According to a 2011 report from the National Academy of Sciences, chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis, back pain and cancer pain, affect at least 100 million adults in the U.S. annually and contribute to over $300 billion a year in lost productivity.
906709_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain.
906709_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	However, opioids cause significant problems for physicians and patients because of their serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation, as well as the risks they pose for addiction, abuse, misuse, and diversion.
906709_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	The FDA has cited prescription opioid analgesics as being at the center of a major public health crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death.
906709_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine 2016 report, there are 1.9 million Americans which have a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers.
906709_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	This same report attributes 18,893 overdose deaths in 2015 were related to prescription pain relievers.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	ONZEALD TM (previously known as NKTR-102 or etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	In 2015, we announced topline data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALD TM , which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with ONZEALD TM ), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	The BEACON study compared ONZEALD TM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S3	In a topline analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALD T M provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALD TM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S4	Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the hazard ratio for survival in the ONZEALD TM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S5	Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S6	We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroups patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S7	We have explored future regulatory and development paths forward for ONZEALD TM with the EU and U.S. health authorities.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S8	In Europe, we met with the National Authorities in Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss the BEACON data.
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S9	In June 2016, we filed an MAA for conditional approval of ONZEALD TM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases .
906709_17_ITEM1_P58_S10	On July 14, 2016, we received a letter from the EMA notifying us that the ONZEALD TM MAA successfully passed validation to be accepted for review.
906709_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	In 2016 we initiated a randomized Phase 3 confirmatory study to evaluate ONZEALD TM as compared to treatment of physician s choice (TPC) in approximately 350 adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases (ATTAIN Study).
906709_17_ITEM1_P59_S1	The primary endpoint of the ATTAIN Study will be overall survival (OS) and the ATTAIN Study will include a pre-specified interim analysis for OS which is to be conducted after 130 events have occurred in the study .
906709_17_ITEM1_P59_S2	In addition, based on our meetings with the FDA s Oncology Division, the FDA staff has indicated that positive results from the ATTAIN Study could potentially support a New Drug Application (NDA) filing in the U.S. where Nektar has retained all rights to ONZEALD TM .
906709_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year.
906709_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman s life is a little less than one in eight (approximately 12%).
906709_17_ITEM1_P60_S2	In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the U.S. and about 40,610 women will die from breast cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease.
906709_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	There are currently no FDA-approved topoisomerase I inhibitors indicated to treat breast cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	We have also conducted clinical studies for ONZEALD TM in other solid tumor settings.
906709_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	In 2013, we completed a Phase 2 clinical study for ONZEALD TM in approximately 170 patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P62_S3	We also initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of ONZEALD TM monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene.
906709_17_ITEM1_P62_S4	The Phase 2 clinical study was designed to enroll 174 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P62_S5	In February 2014, we decided to close enrollment in this study after 80 patients were randomized due to challenges in recruiting new patients because the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the U.S. or EU.
906709_17_ITEM1_P62_S6	We also conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study which enrolled 26 patients to evaluate ONZEALD TM in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers.
906709_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen.
906709_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	On January 18, 2014, we presented data from this study at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, California.
906709_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	In addition to the clinical study of ONZEALD TM being conducted by us, we have also provided support for f our investigator-initiated Phase 2 studies being conducted for ONZEALD TM .
906709_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	On August 7, 2012, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALD TM in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma being conducted at the Stanford Cancer Institute.
906709_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	In May 2013, the study completed enrollment of 20 patients with high-grade glioma who had received a median of three prior lines of therapy before enrolling in the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P64_S4	A separate investigator-initiated clinical study is also being conducted at Stanford to evaluate ONZEALD TM in patients with brain metastasis from primary lung cancer.
906709_17_ITEM1_P64_S5	On February 5, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALD TM in patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer being conducted at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
906709_17_ITEM1_P64_S6	On October 24, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALD TM in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.

906709_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Overview of Collaboration Partner Programs We have a number of product candidates in clinical development and approved products in collaboration with our partners where we invented the drug candidate or where our collaboration partners have licensed our proprietary intellectual property to enable one of their drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	Our agreements with collaboration partners may involve several elements including a technology license as well as the development, commercialization, and manufacturing and supply obligations.
906709_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	We typically receive consideration from our collaboration partners in the form of upfront payments, or milestone payment and royalties on sales.
906709_17_ITEM1_P74_S3	In certain cases, we also manufacture and supply our proprietary polymer materials to our partners.
906709_17_ITEM1_P74_S4	In September 2009, we entered into a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca) pursuant to which we granted AstraZeneca a worldwide, exclusive, perpetual, royalty-bearing license under our patents and other intellectual property to develop, market and sell MOVANTIK and MOVANTIK fixed-dose combination products.
906709_17_ITEM1_P74_S5	MOVANTIK was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	MOVANTIK is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist being investigated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications.
906709_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors.
906709_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur.
906709_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	On September 16, 2014, the FDA approved MOVAN TIK as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	On December 9, 2014, the European Commission, or EC, granted Marketing Author isation to MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the European Union) as the first once-daily oral PAMORA to be approved in the EU for the treatment of OIC in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S2	The EC s approval applies to all 28 EU member countries plus Iceland and Norway.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S3	AstraZeneca launched the commercial sales of MOVANTIK in the United States in March 2015 and MOVENTIG in Germany, the first EU member country, in August 2015.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S4	Under the terms of our license agreement with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca made an initial license payment of $125.0 million to us and has responsibility for all activities and bears all costs associated with research, development and commercialization for MOVANTIK and MOVANTIK fixed-dose combinati on products.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S5	We received milestone payments of $70.0 million and $25.0 million upon the acceptance of regulatory approval applications of MOVANTIK by the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), respectively, in 2013.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S6	We received an additional developmen tal milestone payment of $35.0 million upon the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK in 2014 and a total of $140.0 million upon commercial launches in 2015, including $100.0 million for MOVANTIK in the U.S. and $40.0 million for MOVENTIG in Germany.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S7	We are also e ntitled to up to $375.0 million in sales milestones for MOVANTIK if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S8	For the MOVANTIK fixed-dose combination products, we are also eligible to receive significant development milestones as well as significant sales milestone payments if the program achieves certain annual commercial sales levels.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S9	For both MOVANTIK and the fixed-dose combination products, we are also entitled to significant double-digit royalty payments starting at 20% of net sa les in the U.S. and 18% of net sales in the EU and rest of world, varying by country of sale and level of annual net sales.
906709_17_ITEM1_P78_S10	Our right to receive royalties (subject to certain adjustments) in any particular country will expire upon the later of (a) a specif ied period of time after the first commercial sale of the product in that country or (b) the expiration of patent rights in that particular country.
906709_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	AstraZeneca has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one MOVANTIK fixed-dose combinati on product and has the right to develop multiple products which combine MOVANTIK with opioids.
906709_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	There are a number of patents relevant to MOVANTIK , some of which are listed in the FDA s Orange Book.
906709_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	The Orange Book currently lists six patents for MOVANTIK .
906709_17_ITEM1_P80_S2	Four patents (i.e., U.S. Patent Nos. 7,056,500, 7,662,365, 7,786,133 and 9,012,469) are composition of matter patents - one of which has a patent expiry extending into 2032.

906709_17_ITEM1_P124_S3	We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the CIMZIA product for the longer of ten years from the first commercial sale of the product anywhere in the world or the expiration of patent rights in a particular country.
906709_17_ITEM1_P124_S4	In February 2012, we sold our rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of CIMZIA effective as of January 1, 2012 until the agreement with UCB is terminated or expires.
906709_17_ITEM1_P124_S5	This sale is further discussed in Note 7 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
906709_17_ITEM1_P125_S0	We share a portion of the payments we receive from UCB with Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. pursuant to the terms of the Cross-License and Option Agreement we have with them.
906709_17_ITEM1_P125_S1	Our agreement with UCB Pharma expires upon the expiration of all of UCB s royalty obligations, provided that the agreement can be extended for successive two year renewal periods upon mutual agreement of the parties.
906709_17_ITEM1_P125_S2	In addition, UCB may terminate the agreement should it cease the development and marketing of CIMZIA and either party may terminate for cause under certain conditions.
906709_17_ITEM1_P126_S0	MIRCERA (C.E.R.A.) (Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator), Agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.
906709_17_ITEM1_P127_S0	In December 2000, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), which was amended and restated in its entirety in December 2005.
906709_17_ITEM1_P127_S1	Pursuant to the agreement, we license our intellectual property related to our proprietary PEGylation materials for the manufacture and commercialization of Roche s MIRCERA product.
906709_17_ITEM1_P128_S0	MIRCERA is a novel continuous erythropoietin receptor activator indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S0	As of the end of 2006, we were no longer required to manufacture and supply our proprietary PEGylation materials for MIRCERA under our original agreement.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S1	In February 2012, we entered into a toll-manufacturing agreement with Roche under which we manufactured our proprietary PEGylation material for MIRCERA .
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S2	Roche entered into the toll-manufacturing agreement with the objective of establishing us as a secondary back-up source on a non-exclusive basis through December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S3	Under the terms of this agreement, Roche paid us an up-front payment of $5.0 million plus a total of $22.0 million in performance-based milestone payments upon our achievement of certain manufacturing readiness, validation and production milestones, including the delivery of specified quantities of PEGylation materials, all of which were successfully completed by the end of January 2013.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S4	In 2013, we delivered additional quantities of PEGylation materials used by Roche to produce PEGASYS and MIRCERA for total consideration of approximately $18.6 million.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S5	We were also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of the MIRCERA product.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S6	In February 2012, we sold all of our future rights to receive royalties on future worldwide net sales of MIRCERA effective as of January 1, 2012.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S7	This sale is further discussed in Note 7 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
906709_17_ITEM1_P129_S8	As of December 31, 2016, we no longer have any continuing manufacturing or supply obligations under this MIRCERA agreement.
906709_17_ITEM1_P130_S0	The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries.
906709_17_ITEM1_P130_S1	These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
906709_17_ITEM1_P131_S0	The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms.
906709_17_ITEM1_P131_S1	If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
906709_17_ITEM1_P132_S0	submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval of a drug, a Biological License Application (BLA) for approval of a biological product or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or Premarket Notification 510(k) for a medical device product (a 510(k)).
906709_17_ITEM1_P133_S0	If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests, including those relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA, and clinical trials, may not be necessary if the company has a right of reference to existing preclinical or clinical data under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Services Act.
906709_17_ITEM1_P134_S0	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation.
906709_17_ITEM1_P134_S1	Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations.
906709_17_ITEM1_P134_S2	The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologic s Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin.
906709_17_ITEM1_P134_S3	Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires c larification within that period.
906709_17_ITEM1_P135_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review.
906709_17_ITEM1_P135_S1	Dru g products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).
906709_17_ITEM1_P135_S2	Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to moni tor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P135_S3	Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
906709_17_ITEM1_P135_S4	Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P135_S5	The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted.
906709_17_ITEM1_P135_S6	The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical study.
906709_17_ITEM1_P136_S0	Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases.
906709_17_ITEM1_P137_S0	Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion.
906709_17_ITEM1_P137_S1	Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
906709_17_ITEM1_P138_S0	identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
906709_17_ITEM1_P139_S0	If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability.
906709_17_ITEM1_P140_S0	The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk.
906709_17_ITEM1_P140_S1	In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S0	Following a series of formal meetings and communications between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S1	The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S2	Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S3	Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S4	Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S5	Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S6	The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs.
906709_17_ITEM1_P141_S7	After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
906709_17_ITEM1_P142_S0	Each manufacturing establishment producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment.
906709_17_ITEM1_P142_S1	Such inspections are also held periodically after the commercialization.
906709_17_ITEM1_P142_S2	Establishments handling controlled substances must also be licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
906709_17_ITEM1_P142_S3	Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1_P142_S4	They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
906709_17_ITEM1_P143_S0	For product candidates currently under development utilizing pulmonary technology, the pulmonary inhaler devices are considered to be part of a drug and device combination for deep lung delivery of each specific molec ule.
906709_17_ITEM1_P144_S0	The FDA will make a determination as to the most appropriate center and division within the agency that will assume primary responsibility for the review of the applicable applications, which would consist of an IND and an NDA or BLA where CDER or CBE R are determined to have primary jurisdiction or an investigational device exemption application and PMA or 510(k) where the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is determined to have primary jurisdiction.
906709_17_ITEM1_P144_S1	In the case of our product candidates , CDER in consultation with CDRH could be involved in the review.
906709_17_ITEM1_P145_S0	The assessment of jurisdiction within the FDA is based upon the primary mode of action of the drug or the location of the specific expertise in one of the centers.
906709_17_ITEM1_P145_S1	Where CDRH is determined to have primary jurisdiction over a product, 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is required.
906709_17_ITEM1_P146_S0	Medical devices are classified into one of three classes Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
906709_17_ITEM1_P146_S1	Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a Premarket Notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device.
906709_17_ITEM1_P146_S2	This process is known as 510(k) clearance.
906709_17_ITEM1_P146_S3	Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement.
906709_17_ITEM1_P146_S4	Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring PMA approval.
906709_17_ITEM1_P147_S0	In situations where our partners are responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, we may still participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for the inhaler device, polymer conjugation materials or drug.
906709_17_ITEM1_P147_S1	For our proprietary products, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for product candidates being developed under an IND.
906709_17_ITEM1_P148_S0	The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
906709_17_ITEM1_P148_S1	Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.
906709_17_ITEM1_P148_S2	Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs.
906709_17_ITEM1_P148_S3	Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
906709_17_ITEM1_P149_S0	In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.
906709_17_ITEM1_P149_S1	The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years.
906709_17_ITEM1_P149_S2	In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products.
906709_17_ITEM1_P150_S0	Once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity, a second product that is considered to be the same drug for the same indication generally may be approved during the exclusivity period only if the second product is shown to be clinically superior to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
906709_17_ITEM1_P151_S0	Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the EU.
906709_17_ITEM1_P152_S0	In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation to a product candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.
906709_17_ITEM1_P152_S1	Important features of Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation include a potentially reduced clinical program and close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development.
906709_17_ITEM1_P153_S0	Patents and Proprietary Rights We own more than 215 U.S. and 750 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_17_ITEM1_P153_S1	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1_P153_S2	More specifically, our patents and patent applications cover polymer architecture, drug conjugates, formulations, methods of making polymers and polymer conjugates, methods of administering polymer conjugates, and methods of manufacturing polymers and polymer conjugates.
906709_17_ITEM1_P153_S3	Our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, some of which we acquired in our acquisition of Shearwater Corporation in June 2001.
906709_17_ITEM1_P153_S4	Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world.
906709_17_ITEM1_P153_S5	Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid).
906709_17_ITEM1_P153_S6	In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent.
906709_17_ITEM1_P154_S0	In January 2002, we entered into a Cross-License and Option Agreement with Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Enzon), pursuant to which we and Enzon provided certain licenses to selected portions of each party s PEGylation patent portfolio.
906709_17_ITEM1_P154_S1	In certain cases, we have the option to license certain of Enzon s PEGylation patents for use in our proprietary products or for sublicenses to third parties in each case in exchange for payments to Enzon based on manufacturing profits, revenue share or royalties on net sa les if a designated product candidate is approved in one or more markets.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business, associated technology and intellectual property to Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (together referred to as Novartis) for a purchase price of $115.0 million in cash (Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale).
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S1	In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as of December 31, 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S2	Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Novartis Pharma AG grants back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights acquired by Novartis from us in the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as well as certain improvements or modifications thereto that are made by Novartis.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S3	Certain of such patent rights and other related intellectual property rights relate to our development program for inhaled vancomycin or are necessary for us to satisfy certain continuing contractual obligations to third parties, including in connection with development, manufacture, sale, and commercialization activities related to BAY41-6551 partnered with Bayer Healthcare LLC.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S4	We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S5	No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S6	Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S7	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S8	In certain situations in which we work with drugs covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S9	Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages.
906709_17_ITEM1_P155_S10	Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1_P156_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_17_ITEM1_P156_S1	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_17_ITEM1_P156_S2	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_17_ITEM1_P156_S3	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage).
906709_17_ITEM1_P156_S4	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_17_ITEM1_P156_S5	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patent.

906709_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Drug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	We have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive, difficult to design and implement and highly uncertain as to outcome.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S3	It will take us, or our collaborative partners, many years to conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S4	The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our and our partners financial constraints.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Drug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of preclinical and clinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S6	Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S7	The risk of failure increases for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to ONZEALD TM , NKTR-181, NKTR-214 and other drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S8	For example, while we believe our NKTR-181 Phase 3 clinical program employs the most appropriate clinical trial design, we were unable to identify a single cause for the Phase 2 study for NKTR-181 not meeting its primary efficacy endpoint, and therefore there is increased risk in effectively designing a Phase 3 clinical program for NKTR-181.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S9	The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S10	The risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S11	A number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy or safety, even after achieving preclinical proof-of-concept or positive results from earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing regulatory authorities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of our clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase clinical trials of the product candidate.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We, the FDA, IRB, an independent ethics committee, or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee may suspend a clinical trial at a particular trial site.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If one or more of our drug candidates fail in clinical studies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Our results of operations and financial condition depend significantly on the ability of our collaboration partners to successfully develop and market drugs and they may fail to do so.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Under our collaboration agreements with various pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, our collaboration partner is generally solely responsible for:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	marketing and selling the drugs when and if they are approved.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of significant risks to our business, including risks that:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Given these risks, the success of our current and future collaboration partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business in particular, we expect the commercial outcomes of MOVANTIK , MOVENTIG and ADYNOVATE (previously referred to as BAX 855) to have a particularly significant impact on our near to mid- term financial results and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Additionally, there are also several important drugs in later stage development with collaboration partners including Amikacin Inhale, Cipro DPI, and Fovista .
906709_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If the approved drugs fail to achieve commercial success or the drugs in development fail to have positive late stage clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory approval in major markets, it could significantly impair our access to capital necessary to fund our research and development efforts for our proprietary drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital resources to advance our drug candidate pipeline, it would negatively impact the value of our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are a party to numerous significant collaboration agreements and other strategic transaction agreements (e.g., financings and asset divestitures) that contain complex representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If we are found to have materially breached such agreements, it could subject us to substantial liabilities and harm our financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	From time to time, we are involved in litigation matters involving the interpretation and application of complex terms and conditions of our agreements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	For example, in February 2015 we filed a claim against Allergan and MAP seeking monetary damages re lated to a dispute over the economic sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement with MAP.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	On August 14, 2015, Enzon, Inc. filed a breach of contract claim for alleged unpaid licensing fees.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	In 2013, we settled a breach of contract litigation matter with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) pursuant to which we paid an aggregate of $12.0 million.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or thi rd-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive review process for safety and efficacy by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The time required for obtaining regulatory decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	For example, while data from certain pre-specified subgroups in the BEACON study was positive, the study did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint and the FDA and European Medicines Agency rarely approve drugs on the basis of studies that do not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Further, regulatory authorities have the discretion to analyze data using their own methodologies that may differ from those used by us or our partners which could lead such authorities to arrive at different conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	For example, AstraZeneca will be conducting a post-marketing, observational epidemiological study comparing MOVANTIK to other treatments of OIC in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain and the results of this study could at some point in the future negatively impact the labeling, regulatory status, and commercial potential of MOVANTIK .
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Our partnered drugs that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	If we do not receive substantial milestone or royalty payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	As of December 31, 2016, we had cash and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $389.1 million.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Also, as of December 31, 2016, we had $255.1 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes and $5.1 million of capital lease obligations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	A significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate sufficient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments and we choose to continue our later stage research and development programs, we may need to pursue financing alternatives, including dilutive equity-based financings, such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock, which would dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of our research and development programs.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	While we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have not been able to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, there is a risk that a technique could be discovered in the future to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, which would significantly diminish the value of this drug candidate.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	An important objective of our NKTR-181 drug development program is to create a unique opioid molecule that does not rapidly enter a patient s central nervous system and therefore has the potential to be less susceptible to abuse than alternative opioid therapies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S6	To date, we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have been unable to convert NKTR-181 into a rapidly-acting, more abusable form of opioid.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P17_S7	In the future, an alternative chemistry technique, process or method of administration, or combination thereof, may be discovered to enable the conversion of NKTR-181 into a more abusable opioid, which could significantly and negatively impact the commercial potential or diminish the value of NKTR-181.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The commercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	It is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, drug scheduling status, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our product candidates following approval by regulatory authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate or, if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and this would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations .
906709_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We also depend on our relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and the commercialization of product candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Poor performance by these companies, or disputes with these companies, could negatively impact our revenue and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	The timing of new collaboration partnerships is difficult to predict due to availability of clinical data, the outcomes from our clinical studies, the number of potential partners that need to complete due diligence and approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	terms with respect to our exis ting and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Preliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data become available.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	From time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Preliminary data remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Interim data are also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Delays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us or our partners could result in delay in regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We or our partners may experience delays in clinical trials of drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We currently have several ongoing clinical studies for NKTR-181 in patients with chronic lower back pain and initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical study for NKTR-214 in December 2015.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S8	In addition, our collaboration partners have several ongoing Phase 3 clinical programs including Baxalta for ADYNOVATE (previously referred to as BAX 855) in the EU, Bayer for Amikacin Inhale and CIPRO Inhale, and Ophthotech for Fovista .
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S9	We also have ongoing trials with our partners for the following: Halozyme has trials in Pancreatic, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and other multiple tumor types in Phase 1, 2, and 3 development.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S10	These and other clinical studies may not begin on time, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P21_S11	Clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	changes in regulatory authorities policies or guidance applicable to our drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	If the initiation or completion of any of the planned clinical studies for our drug candidates is delayed for any of the above or other reasons, the regulatory approval process would be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of these drug candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In certain cases, we have existing licenses or cross-licenses with third parties; however, the scope and adequacy of these licenses is very uncertain and can change substantially during long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be prevented from developing and commercializing the drug, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We own more than 215 U.S. and 750 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant and/or broad coverage).
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patents.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S7	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S8	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P26_S9	There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply would actually issue as patents, or do so with commercially relevant and/or broad coverage.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	An adverse outcome in any judicial proceeding involving intellectual property, including patents, could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from or to third parties or require us to cease using the technology in dispute.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our ability to freely commercialize our technologies or products.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S4	We are involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S5	From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S6	A third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P28_S7	Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, they could effectively prevent us, or our partners, from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Costs associated with litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings where we or other third parties are enforcing or seeking intellectual property rights, invalidating or limiting patent rights that have already been allowed or issued, or otherwise asserting proprietary rights through one or more potential legal remedies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	PEGylated Factor VIII which we have exclusively licensed to Baxalta.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The subject matter of our patent filings in this proceeding relates to Bayer s investigational PEGylated recombinant Factor VIII compound.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	We believe that Bayer s claim to an ownership interest in these patent filings is without merit and are vigorously defending sole and exclusive ownership rights to this intellectual property.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, Bayer has filed a claim in the U.S. against Baxalta and Nektar in which Bayer alleges ADYNOVATE infringes a Bayer patent.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	We are also regularly involved in opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office where third parties seek to invalidate or limit the scope of our allowed European patent applications covering (among other things) our drugs and platform technologies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P31_S5	The cost to us in initiating or defending any litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management s attention.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts or result in financial implications either in terms of seeking license arrangements or payment of damages or royalties.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to laws and other governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	We and our contract manufacturers are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and with laws and regulations governing manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and are subject to inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions administering such requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers adherence to such cGMP and other laws and governmental regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures, administrative detention, or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S6	Regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S8	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S9	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture and supply sufficient drug quantities meeting applicable quality standards required to support large clinical studies or commercial manufacturing in a timely manner, it could delay our or our collaboration partners clinical studies or result in a breach of our contractual obligations, which could in turn reduce the potential commercial sales of our or our collaboration partners products.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P32_S10	As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages and any product sales or royalty revenue that we would otherwise be entitled to receive could be reduced, delayed or eliminated.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In some cases, we rely on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply drug product for our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturing of drugs and devices involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstration of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process and analytical methods validations, device performance and challenges in controlling for all of these variables.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party contract manufacturers required for drug and device supply to support our clinical studies and the clinical studies and products of our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Failure by us or our contract manufacturers to supply drug product or devices in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical studies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the past we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We experienced repeated significant delays in starting the Phase 3 clinical development program for Amikacin Inhale as we sought to finalize and validate the device design with a demonstrated capability to be manufactured at commercial scale.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Drug/device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient and doctor use, maintenance of clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is theref ore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, from which we receive upfront fees, contract research payments, milestone and other contingent payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and manufacturing revenue.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from significant payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch or the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S4	Our past revenue generated from collaboration agreements is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S5	If any of our existing or future collaboration partners fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture or ultimately commercialize any product candidate under our collaboration agreement, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S6	If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates successfully.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S7	We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S8	To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must either develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S9	If we decide to market our products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P37_S10	Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or indirectly with our partners include:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	If we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	To the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S2	To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and over which we have little or no control important examples of this risk include MOVANTIK partnered with AstraZeneca and ADYNOVATE (previously referred to as BAX 855) partnered with Baxalta.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment, and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S4	We purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S5	We often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunities or contract liabilities to third parties.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S6	For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P39_S7	Any interruption in supply or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P40_S2	No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P40_S5	We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P40_S6	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported a net loss of $153.5 million.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone and other contingent payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Such third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P43_S3	Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P43_S4	Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P43_S5	For example, President Trump has indicated support for possible new measures related to drug pricing.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	New government legislation or regulations related to pricing or a government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements of, our products hold the potential to severely limit market opportunities of such products.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obl igations could harm our development and commercialization plans.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Though we are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trials, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S5	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S6	The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or the failure of third parties to properly conduct our clinical trials could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P45_S7	Significant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Competitors of our polymer conjugate chemistry technologies include Biogen Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S (formerly assets held by Neose Technologies, Inc.), and NOF Corporation.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing polymer conjugation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	There are many competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in development.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	For Amikacin Inhale, the current standard of care includes several approved intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of either hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilators.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	For MOVANTIK , there are currently several alternative therapies used to address opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD), including RELISTOR Subcutaneous Injection (methylnaltrexone bromide), oral therapy Amitizia (lubiprostone), and oral and rectal over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	In addition, there are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Merck Co., Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., Purdue Pharma L.P. in collaboration with Shionogi Co., Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Develco Pharma GmbH, Alkermes plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Theravance, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	For ADYNOVATE , on June 6, 2014, the FDA approved Biogen Idec s ELOCTATE for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with Hemophilia A, and Bayer Healthcare and Novo Nordisk have ongoing Phase 3 clinical development programs for longer acting Factor VIII proteins based on polymer conjugation technology approaches.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	For NKTR-181, there are numerous companies developing pain therapies designed to have less abuse potential primarily through formulation technologies and techniques applied to existing pain therapies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Potential competitors include Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Egalet Ltd, Elite Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Endo Health Solutions Inc., KemPharm, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Purdue Pharma L.P., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	For ONZEALD TM there are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for breast cancer, including, but not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Xeloda (capecitabine), Afinitor (everolimus), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Ibrance (palbociclib), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Iniparib, Paraplatin (carboplatin), Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for breast cancers include, but are not limited to, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Eisai Inc., and Sanofi Aventis S.A.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P51_S1	In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P51_S2	Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Kite Pharma/NCI, Adaptimmune LLC, Celgene Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, and Novartis, Alkermes, Altor, and Armo in the cytokine-based therapies space, and Tesaro, Macrogenics, Merck, BMS, and Roche in the checkpoint inhibitor space.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P51_S3	There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P51_S4	Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relation ships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technolo gies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P53_S3	Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs or the theft of our confidential information or patient confidential information.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Such events could cause interruptions of our operations.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	For instance, the loss of preclinical data or data from any future clinical trial involving our product candidates could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information of our company or clinical patients, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S6	Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S7	Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S8	If we make a decision to bear a majority or all of the clinical development costs of NKTR-102 this will substantially increase our future capital requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S9	If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S10	If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S11	Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S12	We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S13	Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S14	The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S15	The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S16	We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S17	Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S18	We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S19	Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S20	We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, research, regulatory and finance, and may need to attract and retain marketing and distribution experts and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S21	We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P54_S22	Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the pri ce of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S2	If earthquakes or other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S4	In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S5	There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S6	In the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster, political instability, or terrorist event in any of these locations, our ability to manufacture and supply materials for drug candidates in development and our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers would be significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S7	Our collaborative partners may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S8	We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S9	In addition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S10	We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P56_S11	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Further, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then-current market prices.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We also have a change of control severance benefit plan, which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The price of our common stock is expected to remain volatile.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	During the year ended December 31, 2016, based on closing prices on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $11.00 to $19.68 per share.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	We expect our stock price to remain volatile.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P59_S3	A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including the risks described in this section titled Risk Factors and the following:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	At times, our stock price has been volatile even in the absence of significant news or developments.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The stock prices of biotechnology companies and securities markets generally have been subject to dramatic price swings in recent years.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The indenture governing our 7.75% senior secured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P61_S2	On October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The indenture governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to take various actions, including, among other things:
906709_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	consummate a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination, sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or other change of control transaction.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	This indenture also requires us to maintain a minimum cash balance of $60.0 million.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We have certain reporting obligations under the indenture regarding cash position and royalty revenue.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The indenture specifies a number of events of default, some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, non-payment of material judgments, loss of any material business license, criminal indictment of the Company, and certain civil forfeiture proceedings involving material assets of the Company.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including even ts beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Our failure to comply with our obligations could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness and the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes.
906709_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	The restrictions contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.
906709_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	California We lease a 126,285 square foot facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility), under an operating lease which expires in 2020.
906709_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Mission Bay Facility is our corporate headquarters and also includes our research and development operations.
906709_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Effective January 1, 2017, we entered into a lease amendment for an additional 2,508 square feet within the Mission Bay Facility, which also expires in 2020.
906709_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	Alabama We currently own four facilities consisting of approximately 165,000 square feet in Huntsville, Alabama, which house laboratories as well as administrative, clinical and commercial manufacturing facilities for our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology operations as well as manufacturing of APIs for early clinical studies.
906709_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	In July 2012, we consolidated our U.S.-based research activities into our Mission Bay Facility and ceased use of one of our buildings located in Huntsville that was dedicated to research activities.
906709_17_ITEM2_P1_S2	We are currently seeking a buyer for the land and building.
906709_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	India We own a research and development facility consisting of approximately 88,000 square feet, near Hyderabad, India.
906709_17_ITEM2_P2_S1	In addition, we lease approximately 1,600 square feet of office space in Hyderabad, India, under a three-year operating lease that will expire in 2018.
906709_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings.
906709_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	We are not currently a party to or aware of any proceedings that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	Our common stock trades on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol NKTR.

906709_17_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected consolidated financial data set forth below should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the other information contained herein.
906709_17_ITEM6_P1_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on net sales of UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA .
906709_17_ITEM6_P1_S1	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_17_ITEM6_P1_S2	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests starting in the second quarter of 2012, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_17_ITEM6_P2_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
906709_17_ITEM6_P3_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_17_ITEM6_P3_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_17_ITEM6_P3_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Strategic Direction of Our Business Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops innovative new medicines in areas of high unmet medical need.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, auto-immune disease and chronic pain.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S2	We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S3	These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S4	We continue to make significant investments in building and advancing our pipeline of proprietary drug candidates as we believe that this is the best strategy to build shareholder value.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S5	In 2017, our plan is to execute a broad clinical development program for NKTR-214 in combination with other immuno-oncology agents including Opdivo (nivolumab) as part of our broad Phase 1/2 clinical collaboration with BMS in five tumor types and eight potential indications, a dose-escalation study with atezolizumab, and numerous preclinical collaboration programs.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S6	In February 2017, we filed an IND for NKTR-358, our auto-immune disease drug candidate, and plan to start the Phase 1 study for this program in healthy volunteers and then advance the program into Phase 1b in patients with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), and other potential immune disease indications.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S7	We completed enrollment in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study for NKTR-181 in late 2016 and expect to announce the top-line data in March 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S8	We also have an ongoing pivotal human abuse liability study (HAL) for NKTR-181 that is expected to complete enrollment in the first half of 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S9	If the NKTR-181 Phase 3 program is successful, we plan to seek a collaboration partner to support future development and commercialization activities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S10	We are also completing preclinical research and IND-enabling work for NKTR-262 and NKTR-255 with the goal of advancing those programs into the clinic later this year or in the early part of next year.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S11	The level of our future research and development investment will depend on a number of trends and uncertainties including clinical outcomes, future studies required to advance programs to regulatory approval, and the economics related to potential future collaborations that may include up-front payments, development funding, milestones, and royalties.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S12	We have significant milestone and royalty economic interests in approved drugs and drug candidates in late stage development with our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S13	With AstraZeneca, we have a collaboration for MOVANTIK , an oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult patients with non-cancer pain.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S14	We have a collaboration with Baxalta (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire plc) for ADYNOVATE , that was approved by the FDA in late 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S15	The FDA approved recently expanded the approval of ADYNOVATE for the treatment of Hemophilia A in patients under 12 years of age, and for the use in surgical settings for both adult and pediatric patients.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S16	ADYNOVATE is also under regulatory review in the European Union, Switzerland and Canada.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S17	We also have significant milestone and royalty interests in two drug development programs with Bayer.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S18	BAY41-6551 (Amikacin Inhale), which is an inhaled solution of amikacin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic in Phase 3 clinical development to treat ventilated associated pneumonia and we expect topline results from this program in the first half of 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S19	The second program with Bayer Schering is the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale) which is an inhaled dry powder ciprofloxacin in Phase 3 development to treat non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S20	The first Phase 3 clinical study for CIPRO DPI met its co-primary endpoints for the every 14-day dosing arm of Cipro DPI and we expect top-line results from the second Phase 3 clinical study in 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S21	We also have milestone and royalty interests in other collaboration partner programs including PEGPH20 with Halozyme that is in Phase 3 development and dapirolizumab pegol with UCB Pharma that is in Phase 2 development for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S22	The level of sales growth of MOVANTIK and ADYNOVATE , together with the future clinical trial results and potential subsequent approvals of these collaboration partner drug candidates, will have a material impact on our future financial results and financial position.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S23	Our business is subject to significant risks, including the risks inherent in our development efforts, the results of our clinical trials, the marketing of our dependence on collaborative parties, uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents, the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S24	For a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business, see Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While the approved drugs and clinical development programs described above are key elements of our future success, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier-stage drug candidate pipeline.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S25	We have several drug candidates in earlier stage clinical development or being explored in research that we are preparing to advance into the clinic in future years.
906709_17_ITEM7_P0_S26	We are also advancing several other drug candidates in preclinical development in the areas of cancer immunotherapy, immunology, and other therapeutic indications.
906709_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	trial results are extremely difficult to predict.
906709_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial condition and prospects, results of operations and market value.
906709_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary polymer reagents on a fixed price or cost-plus basis.
906709_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply polymer reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third-party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources We estimate that we have working capital to fund our current business plans through at least March 1, 2018.
906709_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $389.1 million in cash and investments in marketable securities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	Also, as of December 31, 2016, we had $255.1 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes and $5.1 million of capital lease obligations.
906709_17_ITEM7_P2_S5	As is further described in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 24, 2016, we completed a public offering of common stock with net proceeds of approximately $189.3 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, license fees, milestone and other contingent payments and/or contract research payments.
906709_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	The amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations, such as manufacturing and supply commitments, is recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P4_S2	As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue.
906709_17_ITEM7_P4_S3	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations.
906709_17_ITEM7_P4_S4	Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by us to determine the performance periods.
906709_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	Product sales Product sales include predominantly fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and are the result of firm purchase orders from those partners.
906709_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	Product sales increased for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of increased product demand from our collaboration partner Ophthotech related to its drug candidate Fovista .
906709_17_ITEM7_P5_S3	In the year ended December 31, 2016, product sales to Ophthotech totaled $30.1 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	In December 2016, Ophthotech announced that two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for Fovista failed to meet their primary endpoints although a separate Phase 3 trial for Fovista remains ongoing.
906709_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	As a result, other than approximately $10.4 million of product sales to Ophthotech related to their binding purchase commitments, we currently do not expect any further sales to Ophthotech in 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Royalty revenue We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products.
906709_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Royalty revenue received in cash increased for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 due primarily to the commercial launch by AstraZeneca of MOVANTIK in the U.S. in March 2015 and MOVENTIG in the EU in August 2015 and the launch of ADYNOVATE by Baxalta in the U.S. in November 2015.
906709_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	We expect royalty revenue in 2017 will increase as compared to 2016 due to royalties we expect to receive from net sales of MOVANTIK , MOVENTIG and ADYNOVATE as a result of sales growth of these partnered products.
906709_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	We expect non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA in 2017 to increase marginally compared to 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	License, collaboration and other revenue License, collaboration and other revenue includes the recognition of upfront payments, milestone and other contingent payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and reimbursed research and development expenses.
906709_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments, the achievement of milestones and other contingent events, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of reimbursed research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.
906709_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	License, collaboration and other revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the recognition in March 2015 of the $100.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca as a result of the U.S. commercial launch of MOVANTIK and the $40.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca in August 2015 as a result of the EU commercial launch of MOVENTIG partially offset by the recognition of $28.0 million in March 2016 for our 40% share of the $70.0 million sublicense payment received by AstraZeneca from Kirin.
906709_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of increased revenue from payments received from AstraZeneca in 2015 as compared to 2014.
906709_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	During the year-ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $105.0 million of payments from AstraZeneca as a result of the FDA s approval of MOVANTIK in September 2014 and recognized $9.0 million of milestone payments resulting from the transfer of our manufacturing technology to two of our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM7_P8_S5	In addition, in 2014, we recognized $8.0 million of milestones received in December 2014 related to positive results from Baxalta s ADYNOVATE Phase 3 study.
906709_17_ITEM7_P8_S6	We expect license, collaboration and other revenue in 2017 to decrease compared to 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area:
906709_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The decrease in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreased milestone and other contingent payments from our existing European based collaboration partners, including the recognition in 2015 of a total of $140.0 million payments from AstraZeneca in connection with its commercial launches of MOVANTIK described above.
906709_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	contingent payments from our existin g European based collaboration partners, including the recognition of the payments from AstraZeneca in connection with its commercial launches of MOVANTIK described above.
906709_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Cost of goods sold decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the mix of product sales, which resulted in decreases to cost of goods sold even though product sales increased during the same period.
906709_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the increase in product sales of $15.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	The improvement in product gross profit and product gross margin during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is primarily due to a more favorable product mix.
906709_17_ITEM7_P13_S3	In particular, the increased demand from our collaboration partners in 2016 and 2015 results in product sales where we have a relatively higher gross margin.
906709_17_ITEM7_P13_S4	This increased margin is partially offset by a manufacturing arrangement with another partner that includes a fixed price which is less than the fully burdened manufacturing cost for the reagent and we expect this situation to continue with this partner in future years.
906709_17_ITEM7_P13_S5	There were fewer shipments to this partner relative to shipments to other customers during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	In addition to product sales from reagent materials supplied to the partner where our sales are less than our fully burdened manufacturing cost, we also receive royalty revenue from this collaboration.
906709_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the royalty revenue from this collaboration exceeded the related negative gross profit.
906709_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	We expect product gross margin to continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level and mix of manufacturing orders from our customers due to the predominantly fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	We currently expect product gross margin to decrease significantly in 2017 as compared to 2016 and gross margin may approximate breakeven in 2017 as a result of the anticipated decrease in product sales from our collaboration partner Ophthotech as described above.
906709_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of clinical study costs, direct costs of outside research, materials, supplies, licenses and fees as well as personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation).
906709_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of support and facilities-related costs.
906709_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	Research and development expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to costs incurred in our NKTR-214 clinical and NKTR-358 pre-clinical programs as well as increased headcount costs, partially offset by a decrease to our ONZEALD TM program costs.
906709_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	Research and development expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the initiation of Phase 3 clinical studies for NKTR-181 in the first quarter of 2015.
906709_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs.
906709_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The following table shows expenses incurred for clinical and regulatory services, clinical supplies, and preclinical study support provided by third parties as well as direct materials costs for each of our drug candidates.
906709_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	The table also presents other costs and overh ead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1.
906709_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	We partnered this program with Bayer Healthcare LLC in August 2007.
906709_17_ITEM7_P18_S1	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale in 2008, we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	We expect research and development expense to continue to increase in 2017 compared to 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	In 2017, we plan to continue and expand a broad Phase 1/2 clinical development program for NKTR-214 in combination with other immune-oncology therapies including but not limited to Opdivo in collaboration with BMS.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	For NKTR-358, we have filed an IND with the FDA and plan to begin clinical studies in the near-term.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S3	The timing and amount of our future clinical investments in NKTR-214 and NKTR-358 will vary significantly based upon our evaluation of ongoing clinical results and the structure, timing, and scope of potential collaboration partnerships (if any) for these programs.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S4	If our NKTR-181 Phase 3 efficacy study results are positive, we plan to pursue a collaboration to secure a development and commercialization partner to fund further development for NKTR-181 through direct program funding, up-front payments, milestones, or a combination thereof.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S5	In connection with our European Union collaboration partnership with Daiichi-Sankyo and our filing of a conditional approval application for ONZEALD TM with the European Medicines Agency in June 2016, we have initiated a Phase 3 confirmatory study of ONZEALD TM to support our conditional approval application.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S6	In addition, we plan to continue to make substantial investments to support the clinical and commercial manufacturing preparation and scale-up for the nebulizer devices to supply Bayer for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S7	Under our collaboration agreement with Bayer for Amikacin, we are responsible for all clinical and commercial supply of the nebulizer devices for this drug candidate and we will continue to fund our contractual obligation to support manufacturing activities for the Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S8	In addition to our drug candidates that we plan to have in clinical development during 2017 and beyond, we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build the value of our drug candidate pipeline and our business.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S9	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our polymer conjugation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S10	We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_17_ITEM7_P19_S11	Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
906709_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	In order to advance our drug candidates through clinical development, each drug candidate must be tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies.
906709_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete.
906709_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development program as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
906709_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Furthermore, our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for MOVANTIK and Amikacin Inhale.
906709_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	In these situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control.
906709_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	General and administrative expense includes the cost of administrative staffing, business development, marketing, finance, and legal activities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	General and administrative expense increased marginally during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	General and administrative expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a $3.0 million payment obligation related to the settlement of a commercial litigation matter.
906709_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	In 2017, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase compared to 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to our secured notes transaction completed in October 2015.
906709_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased marginally compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_17_ITEM7_P25_S2	As is further described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020 and used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P25_S3	Interest on the 7.75% senior secured notes is calculated based on actual days outstanding over a 360 day year.
906709_17_ITEM7_P25_S4	We expect interest expense in 2017 to be consistent with 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 decreased marginally as compared to the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to the decrease in 2016 and 2 015, respectively, of the average balance of the related liability as that liability balance amortizes.
906709_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser.
906709_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	We impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate, which we currently estimate to be approximately 17%.
906709_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	There are a number of factors that could materially af fect the estimated interest rate, in particular, the amount and timing of royalty payments from future net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis.
906709_17_ITEM7_P27_S4	As a result, future interest rates could differ significantly an d any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively.
906709_17_ITEM7_P27_S5	Unless we adjust our estimated interest rate, we expect non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for 2017 to decrease marginally compared with 2016 as a result of the decreasing royalty liability balance.
906709_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Loss on Extinguishment of Debt As a result of the secured note financing transaction in October 2015 discussed above, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of our 12% notes, which consists of a $11.3 million redemption premium payment, $1.2 million of incremental interest paid at redemption to the 12% note holders and the write-off of $1.6 million of unamortized issuance costs on the 12% notes.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and strategic collaboration agreements, as well as public offering and private placements of debt and equity securities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $389.1 million in cash and investments in marketable securities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	Also, as of December 31, 2016, we had $255.1 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes and $5.1 million of capital lease obligations.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	As described in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 24, 2016, we completed a public offering of common stock with net proceeds of approximately $189.3 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	We estimate that we have working capital to fund our current business plans at least through March 1, 2018.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S5	We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including NKTR-181, Amikacin Inhale, ONZEALD TM , NKTR-214, and NKTR-358, will require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S6	However, we have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S7	In the past we have received a number of significant payments from collaboration agreements and other significant transactions.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S8	In the future, we expect to continue to receive increasing royalties from commercial sales of products such as MOVANTIK , MOVENTIG and ADYNOVATE as they continue to increase sales after their recent product launches and potential substantial payments from future collaboration transactions if drug candidates in our pipeline achieve positive clinical or regulatory outcomes.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S9	Our current business plan is also subject to significant uncertainties and risks as a result of, among other factors, the sales levels of products for which we are entitled to royalties such as MOVANTIK , MOVENTIG and ADYNOVATE , clinical program outcomes, whether, when and on what terms we are able to enter into new collaboration transactions, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and the need to satisfy contingent liabilities, including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S10	The availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on many factors including the success or failure of drug development programs in our pipeline, including NKTR-181, Amikacin Inhale, CIPRO DPI, Fovista , ONZEALD TM , NKTR-214 and NKTR-358, as well as other early stage development programs.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S11	The availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies, whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining regulatory authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs, as well as general capital market conditions.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S12	We will pursue various financing alternatives as needed to continue to fund our research and development activities and to fund the expansion of our business as appropriate.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S13	Due to the potential for adverse developments in the credit markets in 2017 and thereafter, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S14	These investments are generally held to maturity, which, in accordance with our investment policy, is less than two years.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S15	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S16	At December 31, 2016, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately five months and the maturity of any single investment did not exceed one year.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S17	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities.
906709_17_ITEM7_P29_S18	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $117.0 million, which includes $158.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $19.7 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $31.0 million of payments from AstraZeneca related to its sub-license to Kirin, the receipt of a $20.0 million upfront payment in August 2016 from Daiichi Sankyo related to our ONZEALD TM collaboration arrangement in Europe, as well as the receipt of a $10.0 million milestone in January 2016 from our Baxalta collaboration agreement, which was recorded in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront, milestone and other contingent payments received, if any, will increase in the full year of 2017 compared to 2016 primarily as a result of increased research and development expenses.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $73.1 million, which includes $196.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $18.8 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $142.0 million of milestones and other contingent payments from collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $142.0 million, which includes $199.0 million of net operating cash uses as well as $15.0 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $72.0 million of milestones and other contingent payments from collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized as revenue a $70.0 million payment made to us from AstraZeneca in November 2013.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S5	Cash flows from investing activities We paid $6.4 million, $11.2 million, and $10.0 million to purchase property, plant and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S6	We expect our capital expenditures in 2017 to increase compared to 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S7	Restricted cash of $25.0 million was required to be maintained in a separate account until July 1, 2015 under the terms of our 12% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P30_S8	This restriction expired on July 1, 2015 and the restricted funds were returned to us.
906709_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	Cash flows from financing activities On October 24, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of 14,950,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering with total proceeds of approximately $189.7 million after deducting the underwriting commissions and discounts of approximately $12.1 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	In addition, we incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other costs in connection with this offering.
906709_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	On October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due 2020.
906709_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	The notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year.
906709_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	In connection with the issuance of the notes, we paid $8.7 million of transaction and facility fees paid to the purchasers of the notes and other direct costs, which were capitalized as a debt discount and issuance costs and are recorded as a reduction to the note payable liability.
906709_17_ITEM7_P31_S5	On October 5, 2015, we used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due in 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P31_S6	In addition, on October 5, 2015, we paid accrued interest of $3.3 million and made a $12.5 million redemption payment, which includes $1.2 million additional interest paid to the 12% note holders at redemption.
906709_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	On January 28, 2014, we completed the issuance and sale of 9,775,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering with total proceeds of approximately $117.2 million after deducting the underwriting commissions and discounts of approximately $7.5 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	In addition, we incurred approximately $0.6 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other costs in connection with this offering.
906709_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made a payment of $7.0 million to the purchaser of these royalties because a certain minimum MIRCERA net sales threshold was not met.
906709_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	The remaining $108.6 million royalty obligation liability at December 31, 2016 will not be settled in cash.
906709_17_ITEM7_P32_S5	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $20.3 million, $32.2 million, and $47.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 8 of Item 8.
906709_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	In November 2010, we moved into our Mission Bay Facility, which includes our corporate headquarters and a research and development center.
906709_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Under the terms of the sublease we entered into with Pfizer Inc. on September 30, 2009 for the Mission Bay Facility, we began making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014.
906709_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	The sublease is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	These amounts primarily result from our purchase of manufacturing equipment supporting our Amikacin Inhale program.
906709_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2016 that were issued under existing contracts.
906709_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	This amount does not represent any minimum contract termination liabilities for our existing contracts.
906709_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.
906709_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_17_ITEM7_P38_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
906709_17_ITEM7_P38_S2	Actual results may differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
906709_17_ITEM7_P38_S3	We have determined that for the periods in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and the results of our operations.
906709_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Revenue Recognition License, collaboration and other research revenue is recognized based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes amortization of upfront fees.
906709_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	We defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed.
906709_17_ITEM7_P40_S1	The amount of upfront fees and other payments received under our license and collaboration agreements that are allocated to our continuing obligations are recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each arrangement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P40_S2	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research and development activities, or manufacturing activities through the completion of clinical development or the termination or expiration of the collaboration agreement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P40_S3	Given the complexities and uncertainties of collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required by management to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2016, we had $21.7 million of deferred upfront fees related to two collaboration agreements that include research and development obligations that are being amortized over 5 to 22 years, or an average of approximately 13 years.
906709_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	For our collaboration agreements, our performance obligations may span the life of the agreement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	For these, the shortest reasonable period is the end of the development period (estimated to be 4 to 8 years) and the longest period is the contractual life of the agreement, which is generally 10-12 years from the first commercial sale.
906709_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	Given the statistical probability of drug development success in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, drug development programs have only a 5% to 10% probability of reaching commercial success.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	have been as low as $2 million or as high as $11 million as compared to the approximately $2.0 million recognized in th e year ended December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	As of December 31, 2016, we also had $41.3 million of deferred upfront fees related to six license, manufacturing and supply agreements that are being amortized over periods from 3 to 15 years.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	Our performance obligations for these agreements may include technology transfer assistance and/or back-up manufacturing and supply services for a specified period of time; therefore, the time estimated to complete the performance obligations related to licenses is either specified or is much shorter than the collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	We may experience delays in the execution of technology transfer plans, which may result in a longer amortization period for applicable agreements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	Our original estimates are periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimates to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S5	In addition, at the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S6	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S7	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P43_S8	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical study activities performed by third parties.
906709_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients and completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions.
906709_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical studies ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_17_ITEM7_P44_S4	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical studies based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the studies.
906709_17_ITEM7_P44_S5	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_17_ITEM7_P46_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first identified.
906709_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for each respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant (grant date fair value).
906709_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	We expense the estimated fair value of each award, as adjusted by the estimated historical forfeiture rate, ratably over the expected service period of the award.
906709_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
906709_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	Management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_17_ITEM7_P49_S1	In addition, for awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate whether the awards will vest and the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P49_S2	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.
906709_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments from sales of the CIMZIA and MIRCERA drug products marketed by UCB and Roche, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	liability (Royalty Obligation) that we will amortize using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P51_S1	As a result, we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the estimated interest rate.
906709_17_ITEM7_P51_S2	Our estimate of the interest rate under the agreement is based on the amount of royalty payments to be received by RPI over the life of the arrangem ent and payments we are required to make to RPI under the agreement.
906709_17_ITEM7_P51_S3	We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche using a combination of historical results and forecasts from market data sources.
906709_17_ITEM7_P51_S4	To the extent such pa yments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	There are a number of factors that could mate rially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are mad e in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which woul d result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are higher than expected, non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense would b e greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2016 should have been one percentage point higher than our current estimate of 17%, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 3 1, 2016 would have increased by $1.2 million.
906709_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	Numerous updates have been issued subsequent to the initial FASB guidance that provide clarification on a number of specific issues as well as requiring additional disclosures.
906709_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
906709_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	Although we are still evaluating our contracts and assessing all the potential impacts of the standard on existing arrangements we anticipate the adoption may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	Specifically, the new standard differs from the current accounting standard in many respects, such as in the accounting for variable consideration, including milestone payments or contingent payments from our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	Under our current accounting policy, we recognize contingent or milestone payments as revenue in the period that the payment-triggering event occurred or is achieved.
906709_17_ITEM7_P54_S1	The new revenue standard, however, may require us to recognize these payments before the payment-triggering event is completely achieved, subject to management s assessment of whether it is probable that the triggering event will be achieved and that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
906709_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of employee share-based payment accounting, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
906709_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
906709_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
906709_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	The guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
906709_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $0.8 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S5	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $0.6 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2015.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2016, we held $329.5 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of six months.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S8	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S9	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S10	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we currently do not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P0_S11	Accordingly, we believe there are no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities and have not recorded any provisions for impairment.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.
906709_17_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
906709_17_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
906709_17_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_17_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_17_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nektar Therapeutics at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_17_ITEM8_P1_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	We have audited Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
906709_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Nektar Therapeutics management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
906709_17_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
906709_17_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
906709_17_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
906709_17_ITEM8_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
906709_17_ITEM8_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_17_ITEM8_P3_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_17_ITEM8_P3_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_17_ITEM8_P3_S4	In our opinion, Nektar Therapeutics maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.
906709_17_ITEM8_P3_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Nektar Therapeutics and our report dated March 1, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

906709_17_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization We are a research-based biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Francisco, California and incorporated in Delaware.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S1	We are developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, auto-immune disease and chronic pain.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S3	Our research and development activities have required significant ongoing investment to date and are expected to continue to require significant investment.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S4	As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S5	We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreements and financing transactions.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S6	At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $389.1 million in cash and investments in marketable securities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P9_S7	Also, as of December 31, 2016, we had $255.1 million in debt, including $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes and $5.1 million of capital lease obligations, of which $2.9 million is current.
906709_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Nektar Therapeutics (India) Private Limited (Nektar India) and Nektar Therapeutics UK Limited.
906709_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
906709_17_ITEM8_P10_S3	Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
906709_17_ITEM8_P10_S4	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
906709_17_ITEM8_P10_S5	To date, such cumulative translation adjustments have not been significant to our consolidated financial position.
906709_17_ITEM8_P10_S6	Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recorded in operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were not significant.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	Accounting estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S3	Our estimates include those related to estimated selling prices of deliverables in collaboration agreements, estimated periods of performance, the net realizable value of inventory, the impairment of investments, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, contingencies, accrued clinical trial expenses, estimated non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense from our liability related to our sale of future royalties, stock-based compensation, and ongoing litigation, among other estimates.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S5	These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily apparent from other sources.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S6	As appropriate, estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information and any changes in estimates will generally be reflected in the period first identified.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S7	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the classification of debt issuance costs described below.
906709_17_ITEM8_P11_S8	Such reclassifications do not materially impact previously reported revenue, operating loss, net loss, total assets, liabilities or stockholders equity.
906709_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	We consider all investments in marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
906709_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	Investments in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year, or where our intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations, are classified as short-term investments.
906709_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Investments are designated as availa ble-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
906709_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	The disclosed fair value related to our cash equivalents and investments is based primarily on t he reported fair values in our period-end brokerage statements, which are based on market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers and generally represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observa ble market data.
906709_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	We independently validate these fair values using available market quotes and other information.
906709_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale, as well as amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, are included in interest income.
906709_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are included in other income (expense).
906709_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
906709_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the third parties that hold or issue such assets.
906709_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality.
906709_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	Our investment policy limits investments to fixed income securities denominated and payable in U.S. dollars such as U.S. government obligations, money market instruments and funds, and corporate bonds and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer.
906709_17_ITEM8_P16_S3	Accounts Receivable and Significant Customer Concentrations Our customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are located in the U.S. and Europe.
906709_17_ITEM8_P16_S4	Our accounts receivable balance contains billed and unbilled trade receivables from product sales, milestones, other contingent payments and royalties, as well as time and materials based billings from collaborative research and development agreements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	When appropriate, we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts.
906709_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
906709_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	We perform a regular review of our customers credit risk and payment histories, including payments made subsequent to year-end.
906709_17_ITEM8_P17_S3	We have not experienced significant credit losses from our accounts receivable.
906709_17_ITEM8_P17_S4	At December 31, 2016, three different customers represented 39%, 32%, and 13%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_17_ITEM8_P17_S5	At December 31, 2015, three different customers represented 50%, 35%, and 10%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Inventory and Significant Supplier Concentrations Inventory is generally manufactured upon receipt of firm purchase orders from our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	Inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead and cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
906709_17_ITEM8_P18_S2	Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market and defective or excess inventory is written down to net realizable value based on historical experience or projected usage.
906709_17_ITEM8_P18_S3	Inventory related to our research and development activities is expensed when purchased.
906709_17_ITEM8_P18_S4	We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide raw materials, drugs and devices of appropriate quality and reliability and to meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P18_S5	In certain cases, we rely on single sources of supply of one or more critical materials.
906709_17_ITEM8_P18_S6	Consequently, in the event that supplies are delayed or interrupted for any reason, our ability to develop and produce our drug candidates or our ability to meet our supply obligations could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
906709_17_ITEM8_P19_S1	Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
906709_17_ITEM8_P19_S2	Manufacturing, laboratory and other equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over estimated useful lives of three to ten years.
906709_17_ITEM8_P19_S3	Buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over the estimated useful life of twenty years.
906709_17_ITEM8_P19_S4	Leasehold improvements and buildings recorded under capital leases are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
906709_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for another entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
906709_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	We are organized in one reporting unit and evaluate the goodwill for the Company as a whole.
906709_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year using an October 1 measurement date.
906709_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment and goodwill, whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying a mounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
906709_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	When such events occur, we determine whether there has been an impairment in value by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value, as measured by the anticipated undiscounted net cash flo ws associated with the asset.
906709_17_ITEM8_P21_S2	In the case of goodwill impairment, market capitalization is generally used as the measure of fair value.
906709_17_ITEM8_P21_S3	If an impairment in value exists, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
906709_17_ITEM8_P21_S4	Our revenue is derived from our arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaboration partners and may result from one or more of the following: upfront and license fees, payments for contract research and development, milestone and other contingent payments, manufacturing and supply payments, and royalties.
906709_17_ITEM8_P21_S5	Our performance obligations under our collaborations may include licensing our intellectual property, manufacturing and supply obligations, and research and development obligations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	In order to account for the multiple-element arrangements, we identify the deliverables included within the arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
906709_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	Analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment, and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver goods or services, a right or license to use an asset, or another performance obligation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	Revenue is recognized separately for each identified unit of accounting when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met: there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	At the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate all consideration received under multiple-element arrangements to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P23_S3	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material change in our estimates would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	Product sales Product sales are primarily derived from fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	We have not experienced any significant returns from our customers.
906709_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	Generally, we are entitled to royalties from our collaboration partners based on the net sales of their approved drugs that are marketed and sold in one or more countries where we hold royalty rights.
906709_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	We recognize royalty revenue when the cash is received or when the royalty amount to be received is estimable and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_17_ITEM8_P24_S4	With respect to the non-cash royalties related to sale of future royalties described in Note 7, revenue is recognized when estimable, otherwise, revenue is recognized during the period in which the related royalty report is received, which generally occurs in the quarter after the applicable product sales are made.
906709_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	The amount of upfront fees and other payments received by us in license and collaboration arrangements that are allocated to continuing performance obligations, such as manufacturing and supply obligations, is deferred and generally recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each respective arrangement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research activities, clinical development activities, and manufacturing activities from research and development through the commercialization of the product.
906709_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Given the uncertainties of these collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the performance period and this estimate is periodically re-evaluated.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved, which we believe is con sistent with the substance of our performance under our various license and collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	A milestone is defined as an event (i) that can only be achieved based in whole or in part either on the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a sp ecific outcome resulting from the entity s performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due to the entity.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	A milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent with our performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance, relates solely to our past performance, and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S3	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners provide for payments to us upon the achievement of development milestones, such as the completion of clinical trials or regulatory submissions, approvals by regulatory authorities, and commercial launches of drugs.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S4	Given the challenges inherent in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for drug products and in achieving commercial launches, there was substantial uncertainty whether any such milestones would be achieved at the time of execution of these licensing and collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S5	In addition, we evaluated whether the development milestones met the remaining criteria to be considered substantive.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S6	As a result of our analysis, we consider our remaining development milestones under all of our license and collaboration agreements to be substantive and, accordingly, we expect to recognize as revenue future payments received from each milestone only if and as such milestone is achieved.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S7	Our license and collaboration agreements with certain partners also provide for contingent payments to us based solely upon the performance of the respective partner.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S8	For such contingent amounts, we expect to recognize the payments as revenue when earned under the applicable contract, which is generally upon completion of performance by the respective partner, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S9	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners also provide for payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales volumes of approved drugs.
906709_17_ITEM8_P26_S10	We consider these payments to be similar to royalty payments and we will recognize such sales-based payments upon achievement of such sales volumes, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs We recognize costs related to shipping and handling of product to customers in cost of goods sold.
906709_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Research and Development Expense Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits and other operating costs such as outside services, supplies and allocated overhead costs.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	We perform research and development for our proprietary drug candidates and technology development and for certain third parties under collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	For our proprietary drug candidates and our internal technology development programs, we invest our own funds without reimbursement from a third party.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical trial activities performed by third parties.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S3	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S4	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients, and completion of certain clinical trial activities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S5	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical trials ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S6	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical trials based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the trials.
906709_17_ITEM8_P28_S7	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_17_ITEM8_P30_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_17_ITEM8_P30_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period identified.
906709_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock option grants and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), through which employees may purchase our common stock at a discount to the market price.
906709_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of the option on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and the estimated fair value of common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price vola tility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	Management will con tinue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and me thodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination.
906709_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	We expense the value of the portion of the option or award that is ultimately expected to vest based on the historical forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	For options and awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP is recognized over the respective six-month purchase period.
906709_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Expense amounts are recorded in cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense based on the function of the applicable employee.
906709_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Stock-based compensation charges are non-cash charges and as such have no impact on our reported cash flows.
906709_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
906709_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	For all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the net loss available to common stockholders is equal to the reported net loss.
906709_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	Basic and diluted net loss per share are the same due to our historical net losses and the requirement to exclude potentially dilutive securities which would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.
906709_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	During 2016, 2015 and 2014, potentially dilutive securities consisted of common shares underlying outstanding stock options and RSUs.
906709_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	There were weighted average outstanding stock options and RSUs of 19.9 million, 21.1 million and 21.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method.
906709_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
906709_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
906709_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.
906709_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	We utilize a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions.
906709_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
906709_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Comprehensive loss Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.
906709_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Our other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net loss, gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of the assets and liabilities of our India and UK subsidiaries, and unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	This guidance is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	Upon adoption, the new guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	Accordingly, as of January 1, 2016, we reclassified $0.4 million and $3.0 million of capitalized debt issuance costs to senior secured notes, net, and liability related to the sale of future royalties, net, respectively, from our other assets balance.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S4	This reclassification has also been applied retrospectively to these balances in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S5	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S6	Numerous updates have been issued subsequent to the initial FASB guidance that provide clarification on a number of specific issues as well as requiring additional disclosures.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S7	We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S8	Although we are still evaluating our contracts and assessing all the potential impacts of the standard on existing arrangements we anticipate the adoption may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P44_S9	Specifically, the new standard differs from the current accounting standard in many respects, such as in the accounting for variable consideration, including milestone payments or contingent payments from our collaboration partners.
906709_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Under our current accounting policy, we recognize contingent or milestone payments as revenue in the period that the payment-triggering event occurred or is achieved.
906709_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	The new revenue standard, however, may require us to recognize these payments before the payment-triggering event is completely achieved, subject to management s assessment of whether it is probable that the triggering event will be achieved and that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
906709_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of employee share-based payment accounting, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
906709_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	This guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017.
906709_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize almost all leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
906709_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	The guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
906709_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.
906709_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Note 2 Cash and Investments in Marketable Securities Cash and investments in marketable securities, including cash equivalents and restricted cash, are as follows (in thousands).
906709_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	We invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in securities with maturities of two years or less and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	As December 31, 2016 and 2015, all of our investments had maturities of one year or less.
906709_17_ITEM8_P49_S4	Gross unrealized gains and losses were not significant at either December 31, 2016 or 2015.
906709_17_ITEM8_P49_S5	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we sold available-for-sale securities totaling $5.0 million, $42.5 million, and $21.7 million, respectively, and realized gains and losses were not significant in any of those periods.
906709_17_ITEM8_P49_S6	Under the terms of our 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020, we are required to maintain a minimum cash and investments in marketable securities balance of $60.0 million.
906709_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Our portfolio of cash and investments in marketable securities includes (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	All of our investments are categorized as Level 1 or Level 2, as explained in the table above.
906709_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
906709_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had letter of credit arrangements in favor of a landlord and certain vendors totaling $2.4 million.
906709_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	These letters of credit are secured by investments of similar amounts.
906709_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Note 3 Inventory Inventory consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Note 4 Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Building and leasehold improvements include our manufacturing, research and development and administrative facilities and the related improvements to these facilities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	and resear ch and development efforts.
906709_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Construction-in-progress includes assets being built to enhance our manufacturing and research and development efforts.
906709_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Depreciation expense, including depreciation of assets acquired through capital leases, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $13.2 million, $11.4 million, and $11.7 million, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Note 5 Senior Secured Notes On September 30, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement with TC Lending, LLC and TAO Fund, LLC for the sale of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due 2020 (the Notes ).
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	On October 5, 2015, we completed the sale and issuance of the Notes.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Notes are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	The Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S4	Interest is calculated based on actual days outstanding over a 360 day year.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S5	The Notes will mature on October 5, 2020, at which time the outstanding principal will be due and payable.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S6	In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we paid fees and expenses of $8.9 million, of which $8.7 million of transaction and facility fees paid directly to the purchasers of the Notes and other direct issuance costs were capitalized as a debt discount and issuance costs and are recorded as a reduction to the senior secured notes, net liability balance in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S7	The unamortized balance of these costs is $6.5 million at December 31, 2016 and will be amortized to interest expense over the remainder of the five year term of the Notes.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S8	On October 5, 2015, we used a portion of the proceeds from the Notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due in 2017 (12% Notes).
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S9	In addition, on October 5, 2015, we paid $3.3 million of accrued interest on the 12% Notes and made a $12.5 million redemption payment, which includes $1.2 million of additional interest paid to the note holders at redemption.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S10	As a result, we received $100.3 million in net proceeds in connection with these transactions.
906709_17_ITEM8_P61_S11	In addition, as a result of these transactions, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of our 12% Notes, which consists of the $11.3 million redemption premium and $1.2 million of incremental interest paid to the note holders and the write-off of $1.6 million of unamortized issuance costs.
906709_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	The agreement, pursuant to which the Notes were issued, contains customary covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, incur indebtedness, declare or pay dividends, redeem stock, issue preferred stock, make certain investments, merge or consolidate, make dispositions of assets, or enter into certain new businesses or transactions with affiliates, but do not contain covenants related to future financial performance.
906709_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	In particular, the Notes agreement requires us to maintain a minimum cash and investments in marketable securities balance of $60.0 million during the term of the Notes.
906709_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Notes agreement provides that, beginning on October 5, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the Notes, subject to certain prepayment premiums and conditions.
906709_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	If we experience certain change of control events, the holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of the Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_17_ITEM8_P63_S2	In addition, upon certain asset sales, we may be required to offer to use the net proceeds thereof to purchase some of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase.
906709_17_ITEM8_P63_S3	As of December 31, 2016, based on a discounted cash flow analysis using Level 3 inputs including financial discount rates, we believe the $250.0 million in principal amount of the Notes is consistent with its fair value.
906709_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	We have purchased certain manufacturing and office equipment under capital leases.
906709_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the gross amount of assets recorded under capital leases was $8.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and the recorded value of these assets, net of depreciation, was $7.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	We previously leased office space at 201 Industrial Road in San Carlos, California under a capital lease arrangement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	This lease and related subleases ended on October 5, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	Future minimum payments for our capital leases at December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Operating Leases On September 30, 2009, we entered into an operating sublease (Sublease) with Pfizer, Inc. for a 126,285 square foot facility located in San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility).
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Sublease term is 114 months, commencing in August 2010 and terminating on January 31, 2020 and we began making non-cancelable lease payments in 2014, after the expiration of our free rent period on August 1, 2014.
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S2	Monthly base rent will escalate over the term of the sublease at various intervals.
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S3	In addition, throughout the term of the Sublease, we are responsible for paying certain costs and expenses specified in the Sublease, including insurance costs and a pro rata share of operating expenses and applicable taxes for the Mission Bay Facility.
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S4	We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period.
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, rent expense was approximately $3.2 million in each year.
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S6	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had total deferred rent balances of $6.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively, which are recorded in other current and other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
906709_17_ITEM8_P66_S7	Our future minimum lease payments for our operating leases at December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	Note 7 Liability Related to the Sale of Future Royalties On February 24, 2012, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with RPI Finance Trust (RPI), an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, pursuant to which we sold, and RPI purchased, our right to receive royalty payments (the Royalty Entitlement) arising from the worldwide net sales, from and after January 1, 2012, of (a) CIMZIA , under our license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB), and (b) MIRCERA , under our license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together referred to as Roche).
906709_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	We received aggregate cash proceeds of $124.0 million for the Royalty Entitlement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P67_S2	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs, which will be amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P67_S3	Although we sold all of our rights to receive royalties from the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, as a result of our ongoing manufacturing and supply obligations related to the generation of these royalties, we will continue to account for these royalties as revenue and we recorded the $124.0 million in proceeds from this transaction as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that will be amortized using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The following table shows the activity within the liability account during the year en ded December 31, 2016 and for the period from the inception of the royalty transaction on February 24, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2016 (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in March 2014 and March 2013, we were required to pay RPI $7.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, as a result of worldwide net sales of MIRCERA for the 12 month periods ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 not reaching certain minimum thresholds.
906709_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	The Purchase and Sale Agreement does not include any other potential payments related to minimum net sales thresholds and, therefore, we do not expect to make any further payments to RPI related to this agreement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $30.2 million, $22.1 million, and $21.9 million, respectively, in non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA and we recorded $19.7 million, $20.6 million and $20.9 million, respectively, of related non-cash interest expense.
906709_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	As royalties are remitted to RPI from Roche and UCB, the balance of the Royalty Obligation will be effectively repaid over the life of the agreement.
906709_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	In order to determine the amortization of the Royalty Obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by RPI.
906709_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	The sum of these amounts less the $124.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P70_S2	Since inception, our estimate of this total interest expense resulted in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 17%.
906709_17_ITEM8_P70_S3	We periodically assess the estimated royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche and to the extent the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are made in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are more than expected, the non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense recorded by us would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P71_S3	In addition, the Purchase and Sale Agreement grants RPI the right to receive certain reports and other information relating to the Royalty Entitlement and contains other representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations that are customary for a transaction of this nature.
906709_17_ITEM8_P71_S4	To our knowledge, we are currently in compliance with these provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement; however, if we were to breach our obligations, we could be required to pay damages to RPI that are not limited to the purchase price we received in the sale transaction.
906709_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Note 8 Commitments and Contingencies Royalty Expense We have third party licenses that require us to pay royalties based on our sales of certain products and/or on our recognition of royalty revenue under certain of our collaboration agreements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	Royalty expense, which is reflected in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was approximately $3.7 million, $2.8 million, and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	The overall maximum amount of these obligations is based upon sales of the applicable products by our collaboration partners and cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Purchase Commitments In the normal course of business, we enter into various firm purchase commitments related to contract manufacturing, clinical development and certain other items.
906709_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	As of December 31, 2016, these commitments were approximately $5.8 million, all of which are expected to be paid in 2017.
906709_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
906709_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
906709_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	Such provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
906709_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	If any unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of our operations of that period and on our cash flows and liquidity.
906709_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	On August 14, 2015, Enzon, Inc. filed a breach of contract complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Court) claiming damages of $1.5 million (plus interest) for unpaid licensing fees through the date of the complaint.
906709_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	Enzon alleged that we failed to pay a post-patent expiration immunity fee related to one of the licenses.
906709_17_ITEM8_P77_S2	Following a hearing held on December 21, 2015, the Court granted Nektar s motion to dismiss the Enzon complaint.
906709_17_ITEM8_P77_S3	Enzon filed an appeal to the Court s dismissal decision.
906709_17_ITEM8_P77_S4	On October 25, 2016 the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, reversed the earlier decision by the Court granting Nektar s motion to dismiss the Enzon complaint.
906709_17_ITEM8_P77_S5	As a result, the case has been remanded to the Court for further proceedings.
906709_17_ITEM8_P77_S6	No liability has been recorded for this matter on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.
906709_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	Foreign Operations We operate in a number of foreign countries.
906709_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous local laws and regulations that can result in claims made by foreign government agencies or other third parties that are often difficult to predict even after the application of good faith compliance efforts.
906709_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	During the course of our normal operating activities, we have agreed to certain contingent indemnification obligations as further described below.
906709_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	The term of our indemnification obligations is generally perpetual.
906709_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	There is generally no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	To date, we have not incurred significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims based on our indemnification obligations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P79_S4	If any of our indemnification obligations is triggered, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	Because the aggregate amount of any potential indemnification obligation is not a stated amount, the overall maximum amount of any such obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	No liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 or 2015.
906709_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	Indemnifications in Connection with Commercial Agreements As part of our collaboration agreements with our partners related to the license, development, manufacture and supply of drugs based on our proprietary technologies and drug candidates, we generally agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our partners from and against third party liabilities arising out of the agreement, including product liability (with respect to our activities) and infringement of intellectual property to the extent the intellectual property is developed by us and licensed to our partners.
906709_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	As part of the sale of our royalty interest in the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, we and RPI made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by indemnity obligations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P81_S2	Additionally, as part of our pulmonary asset sale to Novartis in 2008, we and Novartis made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by an indemnity obligation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P81_S3	In the event it is determined that we breached certain of the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements made by us in any such agreements, we could incur substantial indemnification liabilities depending on the timing, nature, and amount of any such claims.
906709_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	Indemnification of Underwriters and Initial Purchasers of our Securities In connection with our sale of equity and senior secured debt securities, we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our underwriters or initial purchasers, as applicable, as well as certain related parties from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
906709_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	Director and Officer Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, we indemnify our directors, executive officers, other officers, employees, and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity.
906709_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, we have insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
906709_17_ITEM8_P83_S2	Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1.5 million per incident for merger and acquisition related claims, $1.3 million per incident for securities related claims and $0.5 million per incident for non-securities related claims retention deductible per our insurance policy.
906709_17_ITEM8_P83_S3	However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	We have authorized 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with each share having a par value of $0.0001.
906709_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, no preferred shares are designated, issued or outstanding.

906709_17_ITEM8_P89_S6	The 2012 Plan will terminate on April 3, 2022, unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors.
906709_17_ITEM8_P89_S7	The maximum term of a stock option or stock appreciation right under the 2012 Plan is eight years from the date of grant.
906709_17_ITEM8_P89_S8	The per share exercise price of an option generally may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant.

906709_17_ITEM8_P95_S1	This CIC Plan has subsequently been amended a number of times by our Board of Directors with the most recent amendment occurring on April 5, 2011.
906709_17_ITEM8_P95_S2	The CIC Plan is designed to make certain benefits available to our eligible employees in the event of a change of control of Nektar and, following such change of control, an employee s employment with us or a successor company is terminated in certain specified circumstances.
906709_17_ITEM8_P95_S3	We adopted the CIC Plan to support the continuity of the business in the context of a change of control transaction.

906709_17_ITEM8_P101_S9	This payment sharing arrangement is in lieu of other royalties payable by AstraZeneca to us and a portion of the sales milestones as described below.
906709_17_ITEM8_P101_S10	Our 40% share of royalty payments made by Kirin to AstraZeneca will be financially equivalent to us receiving high single-digit to low double-digit royalties dependent on the level of Kirin s net sales.
906709_17_ITEM8_P101_S11	Kirin s MOVENTIG net sales will be included for purposes of achieving the annual global sales milestones payable to us by AstraZeneca and will also be included for purposes of determining the applicable ex-U.S. royalty rate, from the tier schedule in our AstraZeneca license agreement, that will be applied to ex-U.S. sales outside of the Kirin territory.
906709_17_ITEM8_P101_S12	The global sales milestones under our license agreement with AstraZeneca will be reduced in relation to the amount of Kirin MOVENTIG net sales that contribute to any given annual sales milestone target.
906709_17_ITEM8_P101_S13	As a result, in April 2016, we received 40% (or $28.0 million) of the $70.0 million payment received by AstraZeneca from Kirin.

906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S13	We identified our grant of the exclusive license to Daiichi on May 30, 2016 and our ongoing clinical and regulatory development service obligations as the significant, non-contingent deliverables under the agreement and determined that each represents a separate unit of accounting.
906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S14	We made our best estimate of the selling price for the license grant based on a discounted cash flow analysis of projected ONZEALD TM sales and estimated the selling price for the development services based on our experience with the costs of similar clinical studies and regulatory activities.
906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S15	Based on these estimates, we allocated the $7.5 million non-refundable portion of the $20.0 million upfront payment from Daiichi to these items based on their relative selling prices.
906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S16	As a result, we recognized $3.7 million of revenue in 2016 from this arrangement, primarily related to the delivery of the license.
906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S17	As of December 31, 2016, we have deferred revenue of approximately $3.8 million related to our development service obligations under this agreement, which we expect to recognize through May 2021, the estimated end of our development obligations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S18	If and when the remaining $12.5 million portion of the upfront payment becomes non-refundable, we expect to allocate this amount between the license and development service obligation consistent with the estimated selling prices of these deliverables.
906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S19	The license related amount will be recognized immediately and the development service related amount will be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the remaining obligation period.
906709_17_ITEM8_P104_S20	We determined that the milestones noted above payable to us by Daiichi upon the first commercial sale of ONZEALD TM following conditional marketing approval and following final marketing authorization approval of ONZEALD TM by the EC are substantive milestones that will be recognized if and when achieved.
906709_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	upon Daiichi s first achievement of a certain specified annual net sales target should be consider ed a contingent payment and will be recognized if and when achieved.

906709_17_ITEM8_P118_S6	However, given the current phase of development of the potential products under these collaboration agreements, we cannot estimate the probability or timing of achieving these milestones.
906709_17_ITEM8_P118_S7	As of December 31, 2016, we have deferred revenue of approximately $8.6 million related to these other collaboration agreements, which we expect to recognize through 2020, the estimated end of our obligations under those agreements.
906709_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	Note 11 Stock-Based Compensation We issue stock-based awards from our equity incentive plans, which are more fully described in Note 9.
906709_17_ITEM8_P119_S1	Stock-based compensation expense was recognized as follows (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	As of December 31, 2016, total unrecognized compensation costs of $71.2 million related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements are expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.
906709_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	The following table lists the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions used to calculate the fair value of employee and director stock options.
906709_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	We have never paid dividends, nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, we used a dividend yield of 0.0%.
906709_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	Our estimate of expected volatility is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock at the time of grant over a historical period commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_17_ITEM8_P124_S1	We estimated the weighted-average expected life based on the contractual and vesting terms of the stock options, as well as historical cancellation and exercise data.
906709_17_ITEM8_P124_S2	Stock-based compensation expense resulting from our ESPP was not material in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
906709_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	Summary of Stock Option Activity The table below presents a summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plans (in thousands, except for price per share and contractual life information):
906709_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $6.54, $6.55, and $6.50, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P127_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $17.9 million, $20.5 million, and $25.9 million, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P127_S2	The estimated fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $16.7 million, $16.8 million, and $15.2 million, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	Summary of RSU Activity During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we granted RSUs to officers, employees and non-employee directors.
906709_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	No RSUs vested during 2015 and no RSUs were granted during 2014.
906709_17_ITEM8_P128_S2	Most of our RSU awards have a strictly time-based vesting schedule while some RSU awards vest upon achievement of pre-determined performance milestones along with a time-based vesting schedule.
906709_17_ITEM8_P128_S3	We expense the grant date fair value of the RSUs expected to vest ratably over the expected service or performance period.
906709_17_ITEM8_P128_S4	The fair value of an RSU is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date.
906709_17_ITEM8_P128_S5	A summary of RSU award activity is as follows (in thousands except for per share amounts):
906709_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the grant price of the award, which is zero, and the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	Note 12 Income Taxes Loss before provision (benefit) for income taxes includes the following components (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	The foreign benefit provision in the year ended December 31, 2014 is due to the reduction in taxes related to a favorable determination received from India proceedings.
906709_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	Income tax provision related to continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax loss as follows (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
906709_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	Significant components of our deferred tax assets for federal and state income taxes are as follows (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	Because of our lack of U.S. earnings history, the net U.S. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
906709_17_ITEM8_P135_S2	The valuation allowance increased by $52.5 million and $17.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
906709_17_ITEM8_P135_S3	The valuation allowance includes approximately $35.6 million of income tax benefit at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 related to stock-based compensation and exercises prior to the implementation of the accounting guidance for stock-based compensation that will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized.
906709_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	Undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary in India are considered to be permanently reinvested and accordingly, no deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.
906709_17_ITEM8_P136_S1	Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. income tax.
906709_17_ITEM8_P136_S2	As of December 31, 2016, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $3.4 million of such earnings.
906709_17_ITEM8_P136_S3	Any incremental tax liability would be insignificant due to foreign tax credits that would be realized upon distribution.
906709_17_ITEM8_P136_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,413.3 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2018.
906709_17_ITEM8_P136_S5	As of December 31, 2016, we had a total state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $473.6 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2017.
906709_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
906709_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	We have federal research credits of approximately $50.1 million, which will begin to expire in 2019 and state research credits of approximately $25.2 million which have no expiration date.
906709_17_ITEM8_P137_S2	We have federal orphan drug credits of $17.7 million which will begin to expire in 2026.
906709_17_ITEM8_P137_S3	These tax credits are subject to the same limitations discussed above.
906709_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits We have incurred net operating losses since inception.
906709_17_ITEM8_P138_S1	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
906709_17_ITEM8_P138_S2	If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our effective tax rate may be reduced.
906709_17_ITEM8_P138_S3	We currently have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
906709_17_ITEM8_P138_S4	Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.
906709_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	The decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits in 2015 primarily relates to a California Supreme Court decision relating to the calculation of apportionment of income.
906709_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Alabama, and India.
906709_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	Because of net operating losses and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our domestic tax years remain open and s ubject to examination.
906709_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	We are currently under examination in India for the fiscal years ending 2009, 2013 and 2014.
906709_17_ITEM8_P140_S3	We have the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months.
906709_17_ITEM8_P141_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no significant interest or penalties were recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	We operate in one business segment which focuses on applying our technology platforms to improve the performance of established and novel medicines.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S1	We operate in one segment because our business offerings have similar economics and other characteristics, including the nature of products and manufacturing processes, types of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S2	We are comprehensively managed as one business segment by our Chief Executive Officer.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S3	Our revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S4	AstraZeneca, UCB, Ophthotech and Roche represented 29%, 21%, 19% and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S5	Revenue from AstraZeneca and UCB represented 57% and 13% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S6	Revenue from AstraZeneca, UCB and Roche represented 52%, 16% and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S7	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_17_ITEM8_P142_S8	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	At December 31, 2016, $48.8 million, or approximately 74%, of the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was located in the United States, $10.4 million, or approximately 16% was located at contract manufacturers in Germany and the Netherlands, $5.6 million, or approximately 9%, was located in India, and $0.8 million or approximately 1%, was located in other countries.
906709_17_ITEM8_P143_S1	At December 31, 2015, $54.2 million, or approximately 76%, of the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was located in the United States, $11.1 million, or approximately 16% was located at contract manufacturers in Germany and the Netherlands, and $6.0 million, or approximately 8%, was located in India.
906709_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data.
906709_17_ITEM8_P144_S1	In our opinion, the unaudited information set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as our audited information and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth herein.
906709_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results and expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
906709_17_ITEM8_P145_S1	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
906709_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_17_ITEM8_P146_S1	Such reclassifications have not materially impacted previously reported total revenues, operating loss or net loss.
906709_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	All data is in thousands except per share information.
906709_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	Quarterly loss per share amounts may not total to the year-to-date loss per share due to rounding.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Ernst Young, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S6	We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P4_S4	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
906709_17_ITEM10_P0_S0	Information relating to our executive officers required by this item is set forth in Part I Item 1 of this report under the caption Executive Officers of the Registrant and is incorporated herein by reference.

906709_17_ITEM10_P1_S3	The stock trading program allows a broker acting on behalf of the executive officer, director or other employee to trade our stock during blackout periods or while such executive officer, director or other employee may be aware of material, nonpublic information, if the trade is performed according to a pre-existing contract, instruction or plan that was established with the broker when such executive officer, director or employee was not aware of any material, nonpublic information.

906709_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops innovative medicines in areas of high unmet medical need.
906709_18_ITEM1_P0_S1	Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, autoimmune disease and chronic pain.
906709_18_ITEM1_P0_S2	We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1_P0_S3	These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_18_ITEM1_P0_S4	We refer to our drug candidates where we retain at least U.S. commercial rights as proprietary programs and our other drug candidate programs that we have licensed U.S. and potentially other commercial rights to collaboration partners as collaboration partner programs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	In the area of I-O, we are developing medicines that target biological pathways, which stimulate and sustain the body s immune response in order to fight cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	We are developing medicines designed to directly or indirectly modulate the activity of key immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, to increase their numbers and improve their function to recognize and attack cancer cells.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	NKTR-214, our lead I-O candidate, is a biologic with biased signaling through one of the IL-2 receptor subunits (CD 122) that can stimulate proliferation and growth of tumor-killing immune cells in the tumor micro-environment and increase expression of PD-1 on these immune cells.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S3	On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (BMS Agreement) with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating NKTR-214 and BMS human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo (nivolumab), as a potential combination treatment regimen in at least five tumor types and eight indications, and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a Combined Therapy Trial).
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S4	Under the BMS Agreement, BMS is responsible for 50% of all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by us in connection with third party contract research organizations, laboratories, clinical sites and institutional review boards.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S5	Each party is otherwise responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combination Therapy Trial.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S6	and we are currently enrolling subjects in the expansion phase of the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S7	On February 13, 2018, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (the BMS Collaboration Agreement) with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214, including, without limitation, in combination with BMS s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab), and other compounds of BMS, us or any third party.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S8	The parties have agreed to jointly commercialize NKTR-214 on a worldwide basis.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S9	BMS will pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion and purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement).
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S10	We are eligible to receive additional cash payments of a total of up to $1.43 billion upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and a total of up to $350.0 million upon achievement of certain sales milestones.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S11	We will book all worldwide sales and revenue for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S12	We will share global commercialization profits and losses with BMS for NKTR-214, with Nektar sharing 65% and BMS sharing 35% of the net profits and losses.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S13	BMS will lead commercialization for combinations of NKTR-214 with BMS proprietary medicines, and we will lead all other commercialization efforts for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S14	We will have the final decision-making authority regarding the pricing for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S15	NKTR-214 will be sold on a stand-alone basis and there will be no fixed-dose combinations or co-packaging without the consent of both parties.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S16	Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will collaborate to develop and conduct clinical studies of NKTR-214 pursuant to a joint development plan, which initially includes a series of registration-enabling trials in more than 20 indications in nine tumor types and may be updated and expanded only upon mutual agreement of the parties.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S17	The parties will share the development costs for NKTR-214 in combination regimens based on each party s relative own ership interest in the compounds included in the regimens.
906709_18_ITEM1_P1_S18	Nektar s share of such development costs are limited to an annual cap of $125.0 million.
906709_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	If a registration-enabling study included in the joint development plan does not have the first patient enrolled prior to the date which is 14 months from the closing date, subject to allowable delays, the indication covered by that study is no longer subject to the above exclusivity.
906709_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Other than as described above, Nektar may independently develop and commercialize NKTR-214 either alone or in com bination with other Nektar proprietary compounds or third party compounds.
906709_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	The closing date under the BMS Collaboration Agreement will occur simultaneously with the closing under the Purchase Agreement, which is subject to the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary closing conditions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	The closings are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018, upon which the BMS Collaboration Agreement will supersede and replace the existing BMS Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM1_P4_S2	On May 22, 2017, we announced a research collaboration that is currently underway bewteen Nektar and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) to evaluate NKTR-214 with five compounds from Takeda s cancer portfolio.
906709_18_ITEM1_P4_S3	On September 12, 2017, we announced that we had begun dosing in a clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors, TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) and KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab).
906709_18_ITEM1_P4_S4	This study is planned to enroll patients into two separate arms concurrently with the first arm evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with atezolizumab in up to 30 patients, and the second arm evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 30 patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P4_S5	This study is not impacted by the BMS Collaboration Agreement and we plan to continue this study through completion.
906709_18_ITEM1_P4_S6	In addition to the existing clinical programs, we plan to continue to advance a broad clinical development program, both on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining NKTR-214 with therapies such as cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, small molecules, and other biological agents in order to generate novel immune-oncology approaches.
906709_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body.
906709_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	NKTR-262 is designed to stimulate the innate immune system and promote maturation and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells.
906709_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	NKTR-262 is being developed as an intra-tumoral injection in combination with systemic NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	We filed an IND for NKTR-262 in December 2017 and a Phase 1 clinical trial is expected to start before the end of the first quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	NKTR-255 is a biologic that targets the interleukin-15 pathway in order to activate the body s innate and adaptive immunity.
906709_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	Signaling of the IL-15 pathway induces the proliferation and growth of CD8 memory T cells so the body s immune system retains the ability to identify cancer cells if they re-grow in the body.
906709_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	NKTR-255 has also been shown to stimulate NK cell development.
906709_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	NKTR-255 is currently advancing through preclinical development.
906709_18_ITEM1_P6_S4	In February 2017 we submitted an investigational new drug application (IND) for a new biologic that we are developing, NKTR-358, which is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body that occurs in patients with autoimmune disease.
906709_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	The breakdown of mechanisms assuring recognition of self and non-self is what underlies all autoimmune diseases.
906709_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	A failure of the body's self-tolerance mechanisms is known to result from pathogenic auto reactive T lymphocytes.
906709_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	By increasing the number of regulatory T cells (which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease by maintaining self-tolerance), these pathogenic auto reactive T cells can be reduced and the proper balance of effector and regulatory T cells can be achieved to restore the body's self-tolerance mechanisms.
906709_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	There is consistent evidence that suboptimal regulatory T cell numbers and their lack of activity play a significant role in a myriad of autoimmune diseases.
906709_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	NKTR-358 is designed to optimally target the IL-2 receptor complex in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	NKTR-358 is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of autoimmune diseases.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S1	On July 23, 2017, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) to co-develop NKTR-358.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S2	We received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to an additional $250.0 million for development and regulatory milestones.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S3	We will be responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S4	We will also share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by us.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S5	We will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the global Phase 3 development costs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S6	We are eligible for tiered royalties on global sales up to the low twenties that escalate based upon our level of our contribution to Phase 3 development costs and the level of global product annual sales.
906709_18_ITEM1_P11_S7	Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	In March 2017, we began the first Phase 1 dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in approximately 50 healthy patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	trial to evaluate NKTR-358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	Pain - NKTR-181 NKTR-181 is a novel mu-opioid analgesic drug candidate for chronic pain conditions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	NKTR-181 is currently in Phase 3 clinical development, which we call the SUMMIT Phase 3 program, which includes the SUMMIT-07 efficacy study, a human abuse potential (HAP) study, and the SUMMIT-LTS long-term safety study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	On March 20, 2017, we announced that NKTR-181 met its primary and secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	We enrolled the first patient in the first SUMMIT-07 study in February 2015, and we completed enrollment in the study in late 2016.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	The SUMMIT-07 study compared twice-daily dosing of NKTR-181 tablets to placebo in the treatment of over 600 patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain who were new to opioid therapy (opioid-na ve).
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S5	SUMMIT-07 evaluated four analgesic doses of NKTR-181 (100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg).
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S6	Patients in the trial achieved an average pain score reduction of over 65% (from 6.73 at screening to 2.32 at randomization) during the dose titration period.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S7	The primary efficacy endpoint of the study demonstrated significantly improved chronic back pain relief with NKTR-181 compared to placebo (p=0.0019).
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S8	Key secondary endpoints of the study also achieved high statistical significance.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S9	The study demonstrated that NKTR-181 had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S10	On July 18, 2017, we announced positive top-line data for our pivotal human abuse potential study (HAP) for NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S11	The HAP study was designed to confirm and assess the relative oral abuse potential of NKTR-181, at its maximum analgesic therapeutic, dose (400 mg) studied in the SUMMIT-07 trial and at a supratherapeutic dose (3 times to 12 times greater than the analgesic dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg used in the SUMMIT-07 trial), compared to common therapeutic doses of oxycodone (40 mg and 60 mg) in 54 healthy non-dependent recreational drug users.
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S12	For the primary endpoint of Drug Liking, NKTR-181 (400 mg and 600 mg) rated less likable compared to oxycodone 40 mg and 60 mg (p 0.0001), and a supratherapeutic dose of NKTR-181 (1200 mg) rated less likable than oxycodone 60 mg (p=0.0071).
906709_18_ITEM1_P14_S13	Key secondary endpoints of Area Under Effect for Drug Liking (0-1 hours, 0-2 hours, 0-3 hours), Drug High and Take Drug Again scores met statistical significance for all doses of NKTR-181 (1200 mg, 600 mg, 400 mg) compared to oxycodone (60 mg).
906709_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	The SUMMIT Phase 3 program also includes a 52-week long-term safety study, which we call SUMMIT-LTS.
906709_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	SUMMIT-LTS is evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in 638 patients (opioid-na ve and opioid-experienced) with moderate to severe chronic low pain or chronic non-cancer pain.
906709_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	The study was completed in December 2017.
906709_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Following our success of the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study and the HAP study, we are seeking a partner to support future development and commercialization activities for NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	We have completed pre-NDA meetings with FDA and we are currently planning to file an NDA for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Oncology - ONZEALD TM ONZEALD TM (also known as NKTR-102, etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	On March 17, 2015, we announced top-line data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALD TM , which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with NKTR-102), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	The BEACON study compared ONZEALD TM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	In a top-line analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALD TM provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALD TM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S4	Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the Hazard Ratio (HR) for survival in the ONZEALD TM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S5	Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S6	We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroup populations patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S7	We have explored future regulatory and development paths forward for ONZEALD TM with the European Union (EU) and U.S. health authorities.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S8	In Europe, we met with the National Authorities in Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss the BEACON data.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S9	In June 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for conditional approval of ONZEALD TM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases and began enrolling in the ATTAIN study, which compares the overall survival in patients with breast cancer and brain metastases treated with ONZEALD TM versus physicians treatment of choice.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S10	On July 21, 2017, we were informed by the EMA s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing authorization application for ONZEALD TM in the European Union.
906709_18_ITEM1_P17_S11	On July 26, 2017, we filed a request for re-examination of the opinion adopted by the CHMP (the CHMP Appeal ) but such request was not successful.
906709_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	GmbH (Daiichi), exercising its right to terminate the Collaboration and License Agreement between us and Daiich i (the Daiichi Collaboration Agreement), which termination became effective on February 4, 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	As a result of the termination, we made a $12.5 million termination payment to Daiichi in December 2017, and all rights and licenses granted to Daiichi under t he Daiichi Collaboration Agreement reverted exclusively to Nektar.
906709_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Phase 3 study (ATTAIN) in breast cancer patients having brain metastases is ongoing.
906709_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	Collaboration Partner Programs In 2014, we achieved the first approval of one of our proprietary drug candidates, MOVANTIK (naloxegol), under a global license agreement with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca).
906709_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	MOVANTIK is an oral peripherally-acting opioid antagonist, for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation, or OIC, a side effect caused by chronic administration of prescription opioid pain medicines.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	AstraZeneca markets and sells MOVANTIK in the United States in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. (Daiichi Inc.).
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kirin) has exclusive marketing rights to MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the EU) in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	We have a collaboration with Baxalta Incorporated, (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire plc) to develop and commercialize PEGylated drug candidates with the objective of providing new long-acting therapies for hemophilia patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	Under this collaboration, we worked with Baxalta to develop ADYNOVATE (previously referred to as BAX 855), an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for Hemophilia A based on ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)].
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S4	ADYNOVATE , was first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S5	In December 2016 the FDA expanded the approval of ADYNOVATE for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age, and for the use in surgical settings for both adult and pediatric patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S6	In March 2016, ADYNOVATE was approved in Japan for p atients aged 12 years and older with Hemophilia A and in November 2017 that approval was extended to include pediatric patients under 12 years of age, and those undergoing surgery.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S7	In late 2016, ADYNOVATE (marketed as ADYNOVI) was approved in Switzerland for use in Hemophilia A patients aged 12 years and older and in March 2017, ADYNOVI was approved for use in pediatric patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S8	In November 2016, ADYNOVATE was approved in Canada for patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of Hemophilia A, including for perioperative management.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S9	In March 2017, ADYNOVATE was approved in Australia for use in adult and pediatric patients with Hemophilia A.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S10	In September 2017, ADYNOVATE was approved in Colombia for use in children and adults with Hemophilia A I n January 2018, ADYNOVATE (marketed as ADYNOVI) was approved in the European Union for on-demand and prophylactic use in patients 12 years and older with Hemophilia A.
906709_18_ITEM1_P22_S11	In January 2018, ADYNOVATE was also approved in S. Korea for use in children and adults with Hemophilia A. We retained our right to receive royalties on net sales of the Cipro DPI (Cipro Dry Powder Inhaler, previously called Cipro Inhale), pursuant to a drug development program with Bayer Schering Pharma AG (Bayer Schering) that we transferred to Novartis as part of the 2008 pulmonary asset divestiture transaction.
906709_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	In August 2012, Bayer Schering initiated a global Phase 3 program called RESPIRE for the Cipro DPI product candidate in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB).
906709_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	In September 2016, Bayer Schering presented data from the first Phase 3 trail (RESPIRE 1) at the 2016 European Respiratory Society Annual Meeting which showed in the 14 days on/off regimen, the RESPIRE 1 trial met its primary endpoints of significantly prolonged time to first exacerbation and significantly reduced frequency of exacerbations versus placebo.
906709_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	The top-line results of the second Phase 3 trial (RESPIRE 2) were presented at the American Thoracic Society 2017 International Conference.
906709_18_ITEM1_P23_S3	A pooled analysis of the primary efficacy results from RESPIRE 1 and RESPIRE 2 is positive and the data from both RESPIRE 1 and RESPIRE 2 indicate that Cipro DPI has a positive safety profile.
906709_18_ITEM1_P23_S4	On November 16, 2017, the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted not to recommend Cipro DPI to be approved for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis.
906709_18_ITEM1_P23_S5	Bayer Schering has informed us that they are discontinuing development of Cipro DPI in NCFB for the time being as they evaluate possible future options for this asset.
906709_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	We have a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB) for dapirolizumab pegol, a monovalent pegylated Fab antibody fragment against the CD40 ligand (CD40L), being developed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for which the candidate is entering Phase 2 development with UCB partner Biogen Inc.

906709_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Our Techn ology Platform As a leader in the polymer conjugation field, we have advanced our technology platform to include new advanced polymer technologies that can be tailored in specific and customized ways with the objective of optimizing and significantly improving the profile of a wide range of molecules, including many classes of drugs targeting numerous disease areas.
906709_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	Polymer conjugation or PEGylation has been a highly effective technology platform for the development of therapeutics with significant commercial success, such as Amgen s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) and Roche s PEGASYS (PEG-interferon alfa-2a).
906709_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	Nearly all of the PEGylated drugs approved over the last fifteen years were enabled with our PEGylation technology through our collaborations and licensing partnerships with a number of well-known biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	PEGylation is a versatile technology as a result of polyethylene glycol (PEG) being a water soluble, amphiphilic, non-toxic, non-immunogenic compound that has been shown to safely clear from the body.
906709_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	Its primary use to date has been in currently approved biologic drugs to favorably alter their pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties.
906709_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	However, in spite of its widespread success in commercial drugs, there are some limitations with the first-generation PEGylation approaches that have been used with biologics.
906709_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	For example, these techniques cannot be used successfully to create small molecule drugs which could potentially benefit from the application of the technology.
906709_18_ITEM1_P27_S4	Other limitations of the early applications of PEGylation technology include sub-optimal bioavailability and bioactivity, and its limited ability to be used to fine-tune properties of the drug, as well as its inability to be used to create oral drugs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	With our expertise and proprietary technology in polymer conjugation, we have created the next generation of PEGylation technology.
906709_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Our advanced polymer conjugation technology platform is designed to overcome the limitations of the first generation of the technology platform and to allow the platform to be utilized with a broader range of molecules across many therapeutic areas.
906709_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	We have also developed robust manufacturing processes for generating second generation PEGylation reagents that allow us to utilize the full potential of these newer approaches.
906709_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	Our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms have the potential to offer one or more of the following benefits:
906709_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	reduce immune response to certain macromolecules with the potential to prolong their effectiveness with repeated doses.
906709_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	We have a broad range of approaches that we may use when designing our own drug candidates, some of which are further described below.
906709_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Small Molecule Stable Polymer Conjugates Our customized approach for small molecule polymer conjugates allows for the fine-tuning of the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of small molecule oral drugs to potentially increase their therapeutic benefit.
906709_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	In addition, this approach can enable oral administration of subcutaneously or intravenously delivered small molecule drugs that have low bioavailability when delivered orally.
906709_18_ITEM1_P31_S2	The benefits of this approach can also include: improved potency, modified biodistribution with enhanced pharmacodynamics, and reduced transport across specific membrane barriers in the body, such as the blood-brain barrier.
906709_18_ITEM1_P31_S3	An example of reducing transport across the blood-brain barrier is MOVANTIK , an orally-available peripherally-acting opioid antagonist that is approved in the United States and the EU.
906709_18_ITEM1_P31_S4	An additional example of the application of membrane transport, specifically slowing transport across the blood-brain barrier is NKTR-181, an orally-available mu-opioid analgesic molecule that is currently in Phase 3 clinical development.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Small Molecule Pro-Drug Releasable Polymer Conjugates The pro-drug polymer conjugation approach can be used to optimize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a small molecule drug to substantially increase its efficacy and improve its side effect profile.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	We are currently using this platform with oncolytics, which typically have sub-optimal half-lives that can limit their therapeutic efficacy.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	With our releasable polymer conjugate technology platform, we believe that these drugs can be modulated for programmed release within the body, optimized bioactivity and increased sustained exposure of active drug to tumor cells in the body.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have enabled numerous successful PEGylated biologics on the market today.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S4	Based on our knowledge of the technology and biologics, our scientists have designed novel hydrolyzable linkers that in many cases can be used to optimize bioactivity.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S5	Through rational drug design, a protein or peptide s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S6	An example of this is Baxalta s ADYNOVATE , a longer-acting (PEGylated) form of a full-length recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) protein, which was approved by the FDA in November 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A.
906709_18_ITEM1_P32_S7	In December 2016, Shire plc announced the FDA approved ADYNOVATE for use in surgical settings for both adults and pediatric patients, and that the FDA also approved ADYNOVATE for the treatment of Hemophilia A in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.
906709_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	More recently, our scientists have shown that we can also optimize relative receptor binding characteristics of large molecule conjugates.
906709_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	For instance, the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has two different receptor complexes in the body that cause opposing effects on the immune system.
906709_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	We have engineered different novel conjugates of IL-2 with optimized differential receptor binding to the IL-2 receptor categories in the immune system.
906709_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	By biasing the receptor binding of these molecules in complementary ways, we have made two different drug candidates: NKTR-214, which selectively activates effector T cells, which kill tumors; and NKTR-358, which selectively activates regulatory T cells, which can reduce the pathological immune activation that underlies many autoimmune diseases.
906709_18_ITEM1_P33_S4	Our customized approaches with large molecule polymer conjugates have expanded to include a new approach with biologics, in particular cytokines, which utilizes the polymer as a means to bias action to a certain receptor or receptor sub-type.
906709_18_ITEM1_P33_S5	In addition, a cytokine s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can be substantially improved and its half-life can be significantly extended.
906709_18_ITEM1_P33_S6	An example of this is NKTR-214, which is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine with an every two or every three-week dosing schedule.
906709_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	This approach uses a large molecular weight PEG conjugated to antibody fragments in order to potentially improve their toxicity profile, extend their half-life and allow for ease of synthesis with the antibody.
906709_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	The specially designed PEG replaces the function of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of full length antibodies with a branched architecture PEG with either stable or degradable linkage.
906709_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	This approach can be used to reduce antigenicity, reduce glomerular filtration rate, enhance uptake by inflamed tissues, and retain antigen-binding affinity and recognition.
906709_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	There is currently one approved product on the market that utilizes our technology with an antibody fragment, CIMZIA (certoluzimab pegol), which was developed by our partner UCB Pharma and is approved for the treatment of Crohn s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the U.S. and rheumatoid arthritis in the U.S. and EU.
906709_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	The key elements of our business strategy are described below:
906709_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	Our objective is to create value by advancing our lead drug candidates through various stages of clinical development.
906709_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	To support this strategy, we have significantly expanded and added expertise to our internal preclinical, clinical development and regulatory departments.
906709_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	A key component of our development strategy is to potentially reduce the risks and time associated with drug development by capitalizing on the known safety and efficacy of existing drugs and drug candidates as well as established pharmacologic targets and drugs directed to those targets.
906709_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	For many of our novel drug candidates, we may seek to study the drug candidates in indications for which the parent drugs have not been studied or approved.
906709_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	We believe that the improved characteristics of our drug candidates will provide meaningful benefit to patients compared to the existing therapies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	In addition, in certain instances we have the opportunity to develop new treatments for patients for which the parent drugs are not currently approved.
906709_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Ensure Future Gro wth of our Proprietary Pipeline through Internal Research Efforts and Advancement of our Preclinical Drug Candidates into Clinical Trials We believe it is important to maintain a diverse pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build on the value of our business.
906709_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our discovery research organization is continuing to identify new drug candidates by applying our technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	We continue to advance our most promising research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective of advancing these early-stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	Enter into Strategic and High-Value Partnerships to Bring Certain of Our Drug Candidates to Market We decide on a drug candidate-by-drug candidate basis, how far to advance clinical development (e.g. Phase 1, 2 or 3) and whether to commercialize products on our own, or seek a partner, or pursue a combination of these approaches.
906709_18_ITEM1_P38_S4	When we determine to seek a partner, our strategy is to enter into collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to fund further clinical development, manage the global regulatory filing process, and market and sell drugs in one or more geographies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P38_S5	The options for future collaboration arrangements range from comprehensive licensing and commercialization arrangements to co-promotion and co-development agreements with the structure of the collaboration depending on factors such as the structure of economic risk sharing, the cost and complexity of development, marketing and commercialization needs, therapeutic area and geographic capabilities.
906709_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	We are committed to continuing to build on our intellectual property position in the field of polymer conjugate chemistry.
906709_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	To that end, we have a comprehensive patent strategy with the objective of developing a patent estate covering a wide range of novel inventions, including among others, polymer materials, conjugates, formulations, synthesis, therapeutic areas, methods of treatment and methods of manufacture.
906709_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	The following table summarizes our proprietary drugs and drug candidates that have either received regulatory approval or are being developed by us or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies or independent investigators.
906709_18_ITEM1_P39_S3	The table includes the type of molecule or drug, the target indications for the drug candidate, and the status of the clinical development program.
906709_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Phase 3 or Pivotal product in large-scale clinical trials conducted to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell the drug (these trials are typically initiated following encouraging Phase 2 trial results).
906709_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	Phase 2 a drug candidate in clinical trials to establish dosing and efficacy in patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	Phase 1 a drug candidate in clinical trials, typically in healthy subjects, to test safety.
906709_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	NKTR-214 is a CD122-biased immune-stimulatory cytokine designed to preferentially activate the IL-2 beta sub-receptors and gamma sub-units of the IL-2 receptor in order to proliferate tumor-killing T cells within the body (CD8-positive effector T cells and natural killer T cells) without stimulating regulatory T cells (CD4-positive T cells).
906709_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	This receptor selectivity is intended to increase efficacy and improve safety over existing immunostimulatory cytokine drugs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	Under a research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in December 2015 we commenced a Phase 1 study to evaluate NKTR-214 as a monotherapy in a variety of tumor types to evaluate safety and efficacy, and define the recommended Phase 2 dose of NKTR-214 in patients with solid tumors.
906709_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	In addition, the study also assessed the safety profile of NKTR-214, the immunologic effect of NKTR-214 on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune activation markers in both blood and tumor tissue, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The development program for NKTR-214 includes combinations with a number of therapeutic approaches where we believe there is a strong biologic rationale for complimentary mechanisms of action.
906709_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS are collaborating to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating NKTR-214 and BMS human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo (nivolumab), as a potential combination treatment regimen in five tumor types and eight potential indications, and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a Combined Therapy Trial).
906709_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	The dose expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 program evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo is currently enrolling patients at multiple clinical sites.
906709_18_ITEM1_P44_S3	In the first phase of the PIVOT-02 study, we evaluated the clinical benefit, safety, and tolerability of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo in thirty-eight patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P44_S4	Interim data from the dose-escalation phase of the trial was presented at the 2017 SITC meeting in November 2017.
906709_18_ITEM1_P44_S5	We identified the recommended Phase 2 dose for NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo and are currently enrolling subjects in the expansion phase of the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P44_S6	The second phase of the expansion cohorts is evaluating the safety and efficacy of combining NKTR-214 with Opdivo .
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Under the Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement, BMS is responsible for 50% of all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred in connection with third party contract research organization, laboratories, clinical sites and institutional review boards.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	Each party will otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combined Therapy Trial.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	Nektar and BMS will use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture and supply its compound for each Combined Therapy Trial and will bear the costs related thereto.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S3	On February 13, 2018, we entered into the BMS Collaboration Agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214, including, without limitation, in combination with BMS s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab), and other compounds of BMS, us or any third party.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S4	The parties have agreed to jointly commercialize NKTR-214 on a worldwide basis.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S5	BMS will pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1 billion and purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement).
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S6	We are eligible to receive additional cash payments of a total of up to $1.43 billion upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and a total of up to $350.0 million upon achievement of certain sales milestones.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S7	We will book all worldwide sales and revenue for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S8	We will share global commercialization profits and losses with BMS for NKTR-214, with Nektar sharing 65% and BMS sharing 35% of the net profits and losses.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S9	BMS will lead commercialization for combinations of NKTR-214 with BMS proprietary medicines, and we will lead all other commercialization efforts for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S10	We will have the final decision-making authority regarding the pricing for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S11	NKTR-214 will be sold on a stand-alone basis and there will be no fixed-dose combinations or co-packaging without the consent of both parties.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S12	Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will collaborate to develop and conduct clinical studies of NKTR-214 pursuant to a joint development plan, which initially includes a series of registration-enabling trials in more than 20 indications in nine tumor types and may be updated and expanded only upon mutual agreement of the parties.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S13	The parties will share the development costs for NKTR-214 in combination regimens based on each party s relative ownership interest in the compounds included in the regimens.
906709_18_ITEM1_P45_S14	Nektar s share of such development costs are limited to an annual cap of $125.0 million.
906709_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Neither party will develop any Competing Combination, whether alone or in collaboration with any third party, during a limited exclusivity period from the closing date under the BMS Collaboration Agreement until the later of (i) the first commercial sale of NKTR-214 or (ii) the third anniversary of the closing date, but each party may develop a Competing Combination on its own (but not in collaboration with any third party) during the three years after the end of the foregoing limited exclusivity period.
906709_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	If a registration-enabling study included in the joint development plan does not have the first patient enrolled prior to the date which is 14 months from the closing date, subject to allowable delays, the indication covered by that study is no longer subject to the above exclusivity.
906709_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Other than as described above, Nektar may independently develop and commercialize NKTR-214 either alone or in combination with other Nektar proprietary compounds or third party compounds.
906709_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	The closing under the BMS Collaboration Agreement will occur simultaneously with the closing under a Share Purchase Agreement entered into between us and BMS on February 13, 2018, which is subject to the expiration or early termination of the wai ting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary closing conditions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	The closings are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018, upon which the BMS Collaboration Agreement will supersede and replace the existing Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	In addition to the clinical trials in collaboration with BMS, we also plan to initiate a broad clinical development program, both on our own or in collaboration with other potential partners, to explore the potential of combining NKTR-214 with therapies such as cancer vaccines, adoptive cell therapy, small molecules, and other biological agents in order to generate novel immune-oncology approaches.
906709_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	NKTR-262 NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist that targets toll-like receptors (TLRs) found on innate immune cells in the body.
906709_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	NKTR-262 is designed to overcome the body s dysfunction of antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, which are critical to induce the body s adaptive immunity and create antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells.
906709_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	NKTR-262 is being developed as a single intra-tumoral injection to be administered at the start of therapy with NKTR-214 in order to induce an abscopal response and achieve the goal of complete tumor regression in cancer patients treated with both therapies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	We filed an IND for NKTR-262 in December 2017 and expect to begin enrolling patients in the initial Phase 1 study before the end of the first quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	NKTR-255 NKTR-255 is a memory T cell stimulating cytokine designed to engage the IL-15 pathway to induce long-term T cell activation and improve the quality of T cell memory response to treat cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	Through optimal engagement of the IL-15R /IL-2R receptor complex, NKTR-255 stimulates proliferation and survival of CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and enhances formation of long-term immunological memory which may lead to sustained anti-tumor immune response.
906709_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Native rhIL-15 is rapidly cleared from the body and must be administered frequently and in high doses limiting its utility due to toxicity.
906709_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	NKTR-255 is designed with IL-15 receptor alpha specificity to optimize biological activity and is uniquely engineered to provide optimal exposure and an improved safety profile.
906709_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	Immunology NKTR-358 is designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body which occurs in patients with autoimmune disease.
906709_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	Current systemic treatments for autoimmune disease, including corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents, suppress the immune system broadly and come with severe side effects.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	NKTR-358 targets the CD25 sub-receptor in the interleukin-2 pathway in order to stimulate proliferation and growth of regulatory T cells, which are specific immune cells in the body that modulate the immune system and prevent autoimmune disease by maintaining self-tolerance.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	On July 23, 2017, we entered into the Lilly Agreement, pursuant to which we and Lilly will co develop NKTR-358.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	Under the terms of the Lilly Agreement, we received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to $250.0 million in additional development and regulatory milestones.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	We will be responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S4	We will also share Phase 2 development costs with Lilly, with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by us.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S5	We will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis, ranging from zero to 25% of the global Phase 3 development costs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S6	We are eligible to receive up to double-digit sales royalty rates that escalate based upon our contribution to Phase 3 development cost and the level of global product annual sales.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S7	Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S8	In February 2017 we filed an IND for NKTR-358 and we are currently enrolling patients in the initial Phase 1 dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR 358 in approximately 50 healthy patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P56_S9	The Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2018 to evaluate NKTR 358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other indications.
906709_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	NKTR-181 is an orally-available novel mu-opioid analgesic molecule in development as a long-acting analgesic to treat chronic pain.
906709_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	NKTR-181 is designed with the objective to address the abuse liability and serious central nervous system (CNS) side effects associated with current opioid therapies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P57_S2	NKTR-181 was created using Nektar s proprietary polymer conjugate technology, which provides it with a long-acting profile and slows its entry into the CNS.
906709_18_ITEM1_P57_S3	The abuse deterrent properties of NKTR-181 are inherent to its novel molecular structure and do not rely on a formulation approach to prevent its conversion into a more abusable form of an opioid.
906709_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	In May 2012, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the NKTR-181 development program.
906709_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	In June 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the knee.
906709_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	The Phase 2 clinical study utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal, enriched enrollment study design.
906709_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	The study enrolled 295 opioid-na ve patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were not getting adequate pain reli ef from their current non-opioid pain medication.
906709_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	Patients who qualified during the baseline period entered a titration phase, during which they were titrated on NKTR-181 tablets administered orally twice-daily until a dose was reached that provided a redu ction of at least 20% in the patient s pain score as compared to the patient s own baseline.
906709_18_ITEM1_P59_S4	Patients that achieved this level of analgesia were then randomized on a 1:1 basis to either continue to receive their analgesic dose of NKTR-181 or to receive pla cebo for up to 25 days.
906709_18_ITEM1_P59_S5	The primary endpoint of the study was the average change in a patient s pain score from baseline to the end of the double-blind, randomized treatment period.
906709_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	In the first half of 2013, we conducted a human abuse liability study, or HAL study, for NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	In this study, NKTR-181 had highly statistically significant lower "drug liking" scores and reduced "feeling high" scores as compared to oxycodone at all doses tested (p 0.0001).
906709_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	On June 19, 2013, we presented data from the HAL study at the 2013 Annual Meeting of The College on Problems of Drug Dependence in San Diego, California.
906709_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	On September 26, 2013, we announced results from this Phase 2 efficacy study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P61_S2	Of the 295 patients that entered the study, only 9 patients (representing 3% of the patient population) were unable to achieve meaningful pain relief with NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM1_P61_S3	A total of 213 patients achieved an average 40% reduction in pain and entered the randomized phase of the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P61_S4	NKTR-181 performed as expected as an opioid analgesic throughout the study with patients continuing to show a reduction in pain scores throughout the randomized phase of the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P61_S5	However, patients who were randomized to placebo did not show the expected increase in pain scores observed in similar enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal studies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P61_S6	This unusual lack of a placebo rebound caused the Phase 2 study to miss the primary endpoint in the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	In October 2014, we engaged in an end-of-Phase 2 meeting for NKTR-181 with the FDA, which included discussions of the design of the Phase 3 clinical study program.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	We enrolled the first patient in the first Phase 3 efficacy study, which we call SUMMIT-07 in February 2015 and we completed enrollment in the study in the fourth quarter of 2016.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	In this study, we randomized patients with chronic low back pain in an enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal design which included a qualifying screening period, an open-label titration period where NKTR-181 was given to all patients, followed by a 12-week double-blind randomized period where subjects were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either NKTR-181 or placebo.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S3	On February 29, 2016, we increased the sample size of this trial by approximately 200 patients following a pre-specified sample size assessment by the independent analysis center (IAC) after approximately fifty percent of the initially planned 416 patients completed the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S4	The protocol for the NKTR-181 study defined only two possible outcomes for this pre-planned blinded interim sample size assessment: (1) if the conditional powering at the midpoint of the trial fell between 50-85%, the sample size was to be increased by approximately 200 patients; or (2) if the conditional powering fell below 50%, or above 85%, the sample size was not to be changed.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S5	The IAC s determination was nondiscretionary and was based upon our determination of pre-defined acceptable power to detect a statistically significant difference between NKTR-181 and placebo based on the primary efficacy endpoint.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S6	In January 2017, we started enrollment in a second human abuse liability study where we are assessing abuse liability of supra-therapeutic doses of NKTR-181 in order to further evaluate NKTR-181 for labeling and scheduling purposes.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S7	On March 20, 2017, we announced that NKTR-181 met its primary and secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy Study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P62_S8	On July 18, 2017, we announced positive top-line data for our pivotal human abuse potential study for NKTR-181, which we call the HAP study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P63_S0	The SUMMIT Phase 3 program also includes a 52-week long-term safety study, which we call SUMMIT-LTS.
906709_18_ITEM1_P63_S1	SUMMIT-LTS is evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of NKTR-181 in over 600 patients (opioid-na ve and opioid-experienced) with moderate to severe chronic low pain or chronic non-cancer pain.
906709_18_ITEM1_P63_S2	The study was completed in December 2017.
906709_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	Following our success of the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study and the HAP study, we are seeking a partner to support future development and commercialization activities for NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	We have completed pre-NDA meetings with the FDA to discuss plans for an NDA submission and we are currently planning to file an NDA for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	According to a 2011 report from the National Academy of Sciences, chronic pain conditions, such as osteoarthritis, back pain and cancer pain, affect at least 100 million adults in the U.S. annually and contribute to over $300 billion a year in lost productivity.
906709_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Opioids are considered to be the most effective therapeutic option for pain.
906709_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	However, opioids cause significant problems for physicians and patients because of their serious side effects such as respiratory depression and sedation, as well as the risks they pose for addiction, abuse, misuse, and diversion.
906709_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	The FDA has cited prescription opioid analgesics as being at the center of a major public health crisis of addiction, misuse, abuse, overdose and death.
906709_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine 2016 report, there are 1.9 million Americans which have a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers.
906709_18_ITEM1_P66_S4	This same report attributes 18,893 overdose deaths in 2015 were related to prescription pain relievers.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	ONZEALD TM (previously known as NKTR-102 or etirinotecan pegol) is our next-generation topoisomerase I inhibitor proprietary drug candidate.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	In 2015, we announced top-line data from a Phase 3 clinical study for ONZEALD TM , which we call the BEACON study (BrEAst Cancer Outcomes with ONZEALD TM ), as a single-agent therapy for women with advanced metastatic breast cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S2	The BEACON study compared ONZEALD TM to an active control arm comprised of a single chemotherapy agent of physician s choice (TPC) in patients who were heavily pre-treated with a median of three prior therapies for metastatic disease.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S3	In a top-line analysis of 852 patients from the trial, ONZEALD TM provided a 2.1 month improvement in median overall survival over TPC (12.4 months for patients receiving ONZEALD TM compared to 10.3 months for patients receiving TPC).
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S4	Based on a stratified log-rank analysis, the primary endpoint measuring the hazard ratio for survival in the ONZEALD TM group compared to the active control arm was 0.87 with a p-value of 0.08, which did not achieve statistical significance.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S5	Secondary endpoints in the BEACON study included objective response rate and progression-free survival, which did not achieve statistical significance in the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S6	We also announced that we observed a significant overall survival benefit in two pre-specified subgroups patients with a history of brain metastases and patients with baseline liver metastases at study entry.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S7	We have also conducted clinical studies for ONZEALD TM in other solid tumor settings.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S8	In 2013, we completed a Phase 2 clinical study for ONZEALD TM in approximately 170 patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S9	We also initiated a Phase 2 clinical study of ONZEALD TM monotherapy versus irinotecan in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients with the KRAS mutant gene.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S10	The Phase 2 clinical study was designed to enroll 174 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S11	In February 2014, we decided to close enrollment in this study after 80 patients were randomized due to challenges in recruiting new patients because the comparator arm of this study, single-agent irinotecan, is not the common standard of care for second line metastatic colorectal therapy in the U.S. or EU.
906709_18_ITEM1_P67_S12	We also conducted a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study which enrolled 26 patients to evaluate ONZEALD TM in combination with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin in refractory solid tumor cancers.
906709_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	The chemotherapy agent 5-FU is currently used as a part of a combination treatment regimen for colorectal cancer in combination with irinotecan, which is also known as the FOLFIRI regimen.
906709_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	On January 18, 2014, we presented data from this study at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium in San Francisco, California.

906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	On August 7, 2012, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALD TM in patients with bevacizumab (Avastin)-resistant high-grade glioma being conducted at the Stanford Cancer Institute.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S2	In May 2013, the study completed enrollment of 20 patients with high-grade glioma who had received a median of three prior lines of therapy before enrolling in the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S3	A separate investigator-initiated clinical study is also being conducted at Stanford to evaluate ONZEALD TM in patients with brain metastasis from primary lung cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S4	On February 5, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALD TM in patients with metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer being conducted at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S5	On October 24, 2013, we announced a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study of ONZEALD TM in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S6	We have explored future regulatory and development paths forward for ONZEALD TM with the EU and U.S. health authorities.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S7	In Europe, we met with the National Authorities in Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as the EMA to discuss the BEACON data.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S8	In June 2016, we filed an MAA for conditional approval of ONZEALD TM for adult patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases treated with ONZEALD TM versus physicians treatment of choice in the ATTAIN trial.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S9	On July 21, 2017, we were informed by the EMA s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing authorization application for ONZEALD in the EU.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S10	On July 26, 2017, we filed a request for re-examination of the opinion adopted by the CHMP (the CHMP Appeal ) but we were informed by the CHMP in November 2017 that our request was not successful.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S11	On December 6, 2017 we received notice of termination from Daiichi exercising its right to terminate the Daiichi Collaboration Agreement, which termination became effective on February 4, 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1_P69_S12	As a result of the termination, we made a $12.5 million termination payment to Daiichi in December 2017, and all rights and licenses granted to Daiichi under the Daiichi Collaboration Agreement reverted exclusively to Nektar.
906709_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Phase 3 study (ATTAIN) in breast cancer patients having brain metastases is ongoing.
906709_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	According to the American Cancer Society and World Health Organization, more than 1.4 million women worldwide are diagnosed with breast cancer globally every year.
906709_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	The chance of developing invasive breast cancer at some time in a woman s life is a little less than one in eight (approximately 12%).
906709_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimates there will be 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the U.S. and about 40,610 women will die from breast cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Anthracyclines and taxanes are the among the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer, but the increased use of these agents at an early stage of disease often renders tumors resistant to these drugs by the time the disease recurs, thereby reducing the number of treatment options for metastatic disease.
906709_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	There are currently no FDA-approved topoisomerase I inhibitors indicated to treat breast cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	The following table outlines our collaborations with a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently license our intellectual property and, in some cases, purchase our proprietary PEGylation materials for their drug products.

906709_18_ITEM1_P81_S5	MOVANTIK was developed using our oral small molecule polymer conjugate technology and we advanced this drug through the completion of Phase 2 clinical studies prior to licensing it to AstraZeneca.
906709_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	MOVANTIK is an orally-available peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist which is a medication for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC), which is a common side effect of prescription opioid medications.
906709_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors.
906709_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	When the opioids attach to certain opioid receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, constipation may occur.
906709_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	OIC is a result of decreased fluid absorption and lower gastrointestinal motility due to opioid receptor binding in the gastrointestinal tract.
906709_18_ITEM1_P84_S1	On September 16, 2014, the FDA approved MOVANTIK as the first once-daily oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) medication for the treatment of OIC in adult patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.

906709_18_ITEM1_P125_S8	As of December 31, 2016, we no longer had any continuing manufacturing or supply obligations under this MIRCERA agreement.
906709_18_ITEM1_P126_S0	The research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of products using our technologies are subject to regulation by the FDA and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries.
906709_18_ITEM1_P126_S1	These national agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing (in vitro, in animals, and in human clinical trials), manufacture, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, marketing, advertising and promotion of our products.
906709_18_ITEM1_P127_S0	The approval process required by the FDA before a product using any of our technologies may be marketed in the U.S. depends on whether the chemical composition of the product has previously been approved for use in other dosage forms.
906709_18_ITEM1_P127_S1	If the product is a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved, the process includes the following:
906709_18_ITEM1_P128_S0	submission to the FDA of an NDA for approval of a drug, a Biological License Application (BLA) for approval of a biological product or a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) or Premarket Notification 510(k) for a medical device product (a 510(k)).
906709_18_ITEM1_P129_S0	If the active chemical ingredient has been previously approved by the FDA, the approval process is similar, except that certain preclinical tests, including those relating to systemic toxicity normally required for the IND and NDA or BLA, and clinical trials, may not be necessary if the company ha s a right of reference to existing preclinical or clinical data under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or is eligible for approval under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA or the biosimilars provisions of the Public Health Serv ices Act.
906709_18_ITEM1_P129_S1	Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its chosen formulation.
906709_18_ITEM1_P129_S2	Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA good laboratory practices (GLP) regulations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P129_S3	The results of the preclinical tests for drugs, biological products and combination products subject to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and are reviewed by the FDA before clinical trials can begin.
906709_18_ITEM1_P129_S4	Clinical trials may begin 30 days after receipt of the IND by the FDA, unless the FDA raises objections or requires clarification within that period.
906709_18_ITEM1_P130_S0	Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified, identified medical investigator according to a protocol submitted in the IND for FDA review.
906709_18_ITEM1_P130_S1	Drug products to be used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).
906709_18_ITEM1_P130_S2	Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety and product efficacy as well as other criteria to be evaluated in the study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P130_S3	Each protocol is submitted to the FDA in the IND.
906709_18_ITEM1_P130_S4	Apart from the IND process described above, each clinical study must be reviewed by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the IRB must be kept current with respect to the status of the clinical study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P130_S5	The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the potential risks to subjects participating in the trial and the possible liability to the institution where the trial is conducted.
906709_18_ITEM1_P130_S6	The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form to be signed by the trial participants and any significant changes in the clinical study.
906709_18_ITEM1_P131_S0	Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases.
906709_18_ITEM1_P132_S0	Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects (in most cases) and the product generally is tested for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, absorption, metabolism and excretion.
906709_18_ITEM1_P132_S1	Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to:
906709_18_ITEM1_P133_S0	identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
906709_18_ITEM1_P134_S0	If Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a product appears to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to evaluate the further clinical efficacy and safety of the drug and formulation within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites and in large enough trials to provide statistical proof of efficacy and tolerability.
906709_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	The FDA, the clinical trial sponsor, the investigators or the IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time if any one of them believes that study participants are being subjected to an unacceptable health risk.
906709_18_ITEM1_P135_S1	In some cases, the FDA and the drug sponsor may determine that Phase 2 trials are not needed prior to entering Phase 3 trials.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S0	Following a series of formal meetings and communications between the drug sponsor and the regulatory agencies, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA as an NDA or BLA for approval of the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug product.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S1	The FDA may deny approval if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or pharmaceutical testing or requirements.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S2	Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy all of the criteria for approval.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S3	Additionally, the approved labeling may narrowly limit the conditions of use of the product, including the intended uses, or impose warnings, precautions or contraindications which could significantly limit the potential market for the product.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S4	Further, as a condition of approval, the FDA may impose post-market surveillance, or Phase 4, studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S5	Product approvals, once obtained, may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety concerns arise after the product reaches the market.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S6	The FDA may require additional post-marketing clinical testing and pharmacovigilance programs to monitor the effect of drug products that have been commercialized and has the power to prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of such programs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P136_S7	After approval, there are ongoing reporting obligations concerning adverse reactions associated with the product, including expedited reports for serious and unexpected adverse events.
906709_18_ITEM1_P137_S0	Each manufacturing establishment producing the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for the U.S. market must be registered with the FDA and typically is inspected by the FDA prior to NDA or BLA approval of a drug product manufactured by such establishment.
906709_18_ITEM1_P137_S1	Such inspections are also held periodically after the commercialization.
906709_18_ITEM1_P137_S2	Establishments handling controlled substances must also be licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
906709_18_ITEM1_P137_S3	Manufacturing establishments of U.S. marketed products are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements.
906709_18_ITEM1_P138_S0	They are also subject to U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding workplace safety, environmental protection and hazardous and control led substance controls, among others.
906709_18_ITEM1_P139_S0	For product candidates currently under development utilizing pulmonary technology, the pulmonary inhaler devices are considered to be part of a drug and device combination for deep lung delivery of each specific molecule.
906709_18_ITEM1_P140_S0	The FDA will make a determination as to the most appropriate center and division within the agency that will assume primary responsibility for the review of the applicable applications, which would consist of an IND and an NDA or BLA where CDER or CBER are determined to have primary jurisdiction or an investigational device exemption application and PMA or 510(k) where the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is determined to have primary jurisdiction.
906709_18_ITEM1_P140_S1	In the case of our product candidates, CDER in consultation with CDRH could be involved in the review.
906709_18_ITEM1_P141_S0	The assessment of jurisdiction within the FDA is based upon the primary mode of action of the drug or the location of the specific expertise in one of the centers.
906709_18_ITEM1_P141_S1	Where CDRH is determined to have primary jurisdiction over a product, 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is required.
906709_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	Medical devices are classified into one of three classes Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness.
906709_18_ITEM1_P142_S1	Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a Premarket Notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device.
906709_18_ITEM1_P142_S2	This process is known as 510(k) clearance.
906709_18_ITEM1_P142_S3	Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement.
906709_18_ITEM1_P142_S4	Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in Class III, requiring PMA approval.
906709_18_ITEM1_P143_S0	In situations where our partners are responsible for clinical and regulatory approval procedures, we may still participate in this process by submitting to the FDA a drug master file developed and maintained by us which contains data concerning the manufacturing processes for the inhaler device, polymer conjugation materials or drug.
906709_18_ITEM1_P143_S1	For our proprietary products, we prepare and submit an IND and are responsible for additional clinical and regulatory procedures for product candidates being developed under an IND.
906709_18_ITEM1_P144_S0	The clinical and manufacturing, development and regulatory review and approval process generally takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources.
906709_18_ITEM1_P144_S1	Our ability to manufacture and market products, whether developed by us or under collaboration agreements, ultimately depends upon the completion of satisfactory clinical trials and success in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and equivalent foreign health authorities.
906709_18_ITEM1_P144_S2	Sales of our products outside the U.S. are subject to local regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P144_S3	Such requirements vary widely from country to country.
906709_18_ITEM1_P145_S0	In the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S.
906709_18_ITEM1_P145_S1	The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years.
906709_18_ITEM1_P145_S2	In addition, the Orphan Drug Act provides for protocol assistance, tax credits, research grants, and exclusions from user fees for sponsors of orphan products.
906709_18_ITEM1_P146_S0	Once a product receives orphan drug exclusivity, a second product that is considered to be the same drug for the same indication generally may be approved during the exclusivity period only if the second product is shown to be clinically superior to the original orphan drug in that it is more effective, safer or otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care or the holder of exclusive approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.
906709_18_ITEM1_P147_S0	Similar incentives also are available for orphan drugs in the EU.
906709_18_ITEM1_P148_S0	In the U.S., the FDA may grant Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation to a product candidate, which allows the FDA to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended for serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P148_S1	Important features of Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation include a potentially reduced clinical program and close, early communication between the FDA and the sponsor company to improve the efficiency of product development.
906709_18_ITEM1_P149_S0	Coverage, Reimbursement, and Pricing Sales of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval depends, in part, on the coverage and reimbursement status of those products.
906709_18_ITEM1_P149_S1	In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors.
906709_18_ITEM1_P149_S2	Third-party payors include government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P150_S0	The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product.
906709_18_ITEM1_P150_S1	Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S0	may also refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formul aries or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S1	Further, private payors often follow the coverage and payment policies established by certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which require manufacturers to comply with certain rebate, price reporting, and other obligations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S2	For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the Medicaid program (a program for financially needy patients, amon g others), requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under which the manufacturer agrees to report certain prices to the government a nd pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients, as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S3	Further, in order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the Public Health Service s 340B drug pr icing program.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S4	Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S5	Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the price of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S6	The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement, among other controls.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S7	Adoption of price controls or other cost-containment measures could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments or private payors will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S8	If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S9	The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S10	Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S11	Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S12	Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S13	These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S14	In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.
906709_18_ITEM1_P151_S15	The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
906709_18_ITEM1_P152_S0	state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
906709_18_ITEM1_P153_S0	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Affordable Care Act ), enacted in 2010, expanded the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b.
906709_18_ITEM1_P154_S0	Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
906709_18_ITEM1_P154_S1	In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute.
906709_18_ITEM1_P155_S0	Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P156_S0	The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent.
906709_18_ITEM1_P156_S1	Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label.
906709_18_ITEM1_P156_S2	In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
906709_18_ITEM1_P156_S3	For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product.
906709_18_ITEM1_P156_S4	Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
906709_18_ITEM1_P156_S5	In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
906709_18_ITEM1_P157_S0	Legislative and Regulatory Landscape From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P157_S1	In addition to new legislation, FDA and healthcare fraud and abuse and coverage and reimbursement regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
906709_18_ITEM1_P157_S2	Further, the 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections and subsequent developments have caused the future state of many core aspects of the current health care marketplace to be uncertain, as the new Presidential Administration and Congress have repeatedly expressed a desire to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act.
906709_18_ITEM1_P157_S3	While specific changes and their timing are not yet apparent, there may be significant changes to the healthcare environment in the future that could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval.
906709_18_ITEM1_P157_S4	Furthermore, federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the privacy sector have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system.
906709_18_ITEM1_P157_S5	Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for or the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures and affect our ultimate profitability.
906709_18_ITEM1_P158_S0	Patents and Proprietary Rights We own more than 250 U.S. and 800 foreign patents and a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P158_S1	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1_P159_S0	methods of administering polymer conjugates, and methods of manufacturing polymers and polymer conjugates.
906709_18_ITEM1_P159_S1	Our patent portfolio contains patents and patent applications that encompass our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, some of w hich we acquired in our acquisition of Shearwater Corporation in June 2001.
906709_18_ITEM1_P159_S2	Our patent strategy is to file patent applications on innovations and improvements to cover a significant majority of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world.
906709_18_ITEM1_P159_S3	Generally, pate nts have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date (assuming all maintenance fees are paid).
906709_18_ITEM1_P159_S4	In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the pa tent.
906709_18_ITEM1_P160_S0	In January 2002, we entered into a Cross-License and Option Agreement with Enzon, pursuant to which we and Enzon provided certain licenses to selected portions of each party s PEGylation patent portfolio.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S0	On December 31, 2008, we completed the sale of certain assets related to our pulmonary business, associated technology and intellectual property to Novartis Pharma AG and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (together referred to as Novartis) for a purchase price of $115.0 million in cash (Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale).
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S1	In connection with the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as of December 31, 2008, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S2	Pursuant to the exclusive license agreement, Novartis Pharma AG grants back to us an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free and worldwide license under certain specific patent rights and other related intellectual property rights acquired by Novartis from us in the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale, as well as certain improvements or modifications thereto that are made by Novartis.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S3	Certain of such patent rights and other related intellectual property rights relate to our development program for inhaled vancomycin or are necessary for us to satisfy certain continuing contractual obligations to third parties, including in connection with development, manufacture, sale, and commercialization activities related to BAY41-6551 partnered with Bayer Healthcare LLC.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S4	We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S5	No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S6	Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to, or disclose, our trade secrets.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S7	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including but not limited to We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S8	In certain situations in which we work with drugs covered by one or more patents, our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be affected by limitations in our access to these proprietary drugs.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S9	Even if we believe we are free to work with a proprietary drug, we cannot guarantee that we will not be accused of, or determined to be, infringing a third party s rights and be prohibited from working with the drug or found liable for damages.
906709_18_ITEM1_P161_S10	Any such restriction on access or liability for damages would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S1	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S2	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S3	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant or broad coverage).
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S4	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S5	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patent.
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S6	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_18_ITEM1_P162_S7	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_18_ITEM1_P163_S0	U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights exist that are owned by third parties and relate to pharmaceutical compositions and reagents, medical devices and equipment and methods for preparation, packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical compositions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P163_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, of these rights will be considered relevant to our technology by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_18_ITEM1_P163_S2	We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims.
906709_18_ITEM1_P163_S3	Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages.
906709_18_ITEM1_P164_S0	In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties.
906709_18_ITEM1_P164_S1	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternative technology.
906709_18_ITEM1_P164_S2	The failure to obtain licenses if needed may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1_P164_S3	Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, including without limitation, We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_18_ITEM1_P165_S0	It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponso red researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us.
906709_18_ITEM1_P165_S1	These agreements provide that all confidential information develo ped or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
906709_18_ITEM1_P165_S2	The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employ ee shall be our property.
906709_18_ITEM1_P165_S3	There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
906709_18_ITEM1_P165_S4	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements with partners, under which we may receive contract research payments, milestone payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties or product sales revenue.
906709_18_ITEM1_P165_S5	The revenue generated under the Lilly Agreement and the license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB represented 42% and 12% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM1_P165_S6	No other collaboration partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM1_P166_S0	Backlog Pursuant to our collaboration agreements, we manufacture and supply our proprietary polymer conjugation materials.
906709_18_ITEM1_P166_S1	Inventory is produced and sales are made pursuant to customer purchase orders for delivery.
906709_18_ITEM1_P166_S2	The volume of our proprietary polymer conjugation materials actually ordered by our customers, as well as shipment schedules, are subject to frequent revisions that reflect changes in both the customers needs and our manufacturing capacity.
906709_18_ITEM1_P166_S3	In our partnered programs where we provide contract research services, those services are typically provided under a work plan that is subject to frequent revisions that change based on the development needs and status of the program.
906709_18_ITEM1_P166_S4	The backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including scheduled date of manufacture and delivery and development program status.
906709_18_ITEM1_P166_S5	In light of industry practice and our own experience, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results.
906709_18_ITEM1_P167_S0	Competition Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intense and characterized by aggressive research and development and rapidly-evolving science, technology, and standards of medical care throughout the world.
906709_18_ITEM1_P167_S1	We frequently compete with pharmaceutical companies and other institutions with greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_18_ITEM1_P167_S2	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S0	Science and Technology Competition We believe that our proprietary and partnered products will compete with others in the market on the basis of one or more of the following parameters: efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost.
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S1	We face intense science and technology competition from a multitude of technologies seeking to enhance the efficacy, safety and ease of use of approved drugs and new drug molecule candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S2	A number of the drug candidates in our pipeline have direct and indirect competition from large pharmaceutical companies and biopharmaceutical companies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S3	With our advanced polymer conjugate technologies, we believe we have competitive advantages relating to factors such as efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost for certain applications and molecules.
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S4	We constantly monitor scientific and medical developments in order to improve our current technologies, seek licensing opportunities where appropriate, and determine the best applications for our technology platforms.
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S5	In the fields of advanced polymer conjugate technologies, our competitors include Biogen Idec Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories, Ltd., Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, NOF Corporation, and Novo Nordisk A/S (assets formerly held by Neose Technologies, Inc.).
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S6	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing advanced polymer conjugate technology or technologies intended to deliver similar scientific and medical benefits.
906709_18_ITEM1_P168_S7	Some of these companies license intellectual property or PEGylation materials to other companies, while others apply the technology to create their own drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1_P169_S0	There are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors.
906709_18_ITEM1_P169_S1	In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors.
906709_18_ITEM1_P169_S2	Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Kite Pharma/NCI, Adaptimmune LLC, Celgene Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, and Novartis, Alkermes, Altor, and Armo in the cytokine-based therapies space, and Tesaro, Macrogenics, Merck, BMS, and Roche in the checkpoint inhibitor space.
906709_18_ITEM1_P170_S0	There are a number of competitors in various stages of clinical development that are working on programs which are designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body due to autoimmune disease.
906709_18_ITEM1_P170_S1	In particular, we expect to compete with therapies that could be cytokine-based therapies (Symbiotix, LLC and Tizona Therapeutics), regulatory T cell therapies (Targazyme, Inc., Juno Therapeutics and Tract Therapeutics, Inc.), or IL-2-based and toleragen-based therapies (Celgene Corporation, Amgen Inc., Tolera Therapeutics, Inc., and Caladrius BioSciences, Inc.).
906709_18_ITEM1_P171_S0	There are numerous companies developing pain therapies designed to have less abuse potential primarily through formulation technologies and techniques applied to existing pain therapies.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S0	There are no other once-daily oral drugs that act specifically to block or reverse the action of opioids on receptors in the gastrointestinal tract which are approved specifically for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) or opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD) in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S1	The only approved oral treatment for opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic, non-cancer pain is a twice daily oral therapy called AMITIZA (lubiprostone), which acts by specifically activating CIC-2 chloride channels in the gastrointestinal tract to increase secretions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S2	AMITIZA is marketed by Sucampo Pharmaceuticals and Takeda.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S3	There is also a subcutaneous treatment and an oral treatment known as RELISTOR which is marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Ltd (formerly Salix) under a license from Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S4	In 2014, RELISTOR Subjectaneous Injection was approved by the FDA for adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S5	On July 22, 2016, Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) oral tablets for the treatment of OCI in adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain was approved by FDA.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S6	Other therapies used to treat OIC and OBD include over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners, such as docusate sodium, senna, and milk of magnesia.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S7	These therapies do not address the underlying cause of constipation as a result of opioid use and are generally viewed as ineffective or only partially effective to treat the symptoms of OIC and OBD.
906709_18_ITEM1_P172_S8	There are a number of companies developing potential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P173_S0	Potential competitors include Merck Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Actavis plc, Purdue Pharma L.P. in collaboration with Shionogi Co., Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_18_ITEM1_P173_S1	Limited, Theravance, Inc., Develco Pharma, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_18_ITEM1_P174_S0	On June 6, 2014, the FDA approved Biogen Idec s ELOCTATE TM [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with Hemophilia A. ELOCTATE TM is intended to be an extended half-life Factor VIII therapy with prolonged circulation in the body with the potential to extend the interval between prophylactic infusions.
906709_18_ITEM1_P174_S1	Prior to its 2014 approval, the fusion protein in ELOCTATE TM was not used outside of the clinical trial setting for Hemophilia A patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P174_S2	There are other long-acting Factor VIII programs in late-stage development for Hemophilia A patients.
906709_18_ITEM1_P174_S3	Bayer Healthcare and Novo Nordisk have ongoing Phase 3 clinical development programs for longer acting Factor VIII proteins based on PEGylation technology approaches.
906709_18_ITEM1_P174_S4	These programs, if developed successfully and approved by health authorities, would be competitors in the longer acting Factor VIII market.
906709_18_ITEM1_P175_S0	There are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinical development for advanced breast cancer.
906709_18_ITEM1_P175_S1	These therapies are only partially effective in treating advanced or metastatic breast cancer and none of them have a specific indication in either the U.S. or Europe for treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer and co-existing brain metastases.
906709_18_ITEM1_P175_S2	These therapies include but are not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Afinitor (everolimus), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemzar (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Xeloda (capecitabine) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_18_ITEM1_P176_S0	Major pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for these cancers include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eisai, Inc., Roche Holding Group (including its Genentech subsidiary), GlaxoSmithKline plc, Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly Co., Sanofi Aventis S.A., and others.
906709_18_ITEM1_P177_S0	Research and Development Our total research and development expenditures can be disaggregated into the following significant types of expenses (in millions):
906709_18_ITEM1_P178_S0	Manufacturing and Supply We have a manufacturing facility located in Huntsville, Alabama that is capable of manufacturing our proprietary PEGylation materials for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
906709_18_ITEM1_P178_S1	The facility is also used to produce APIs to support the early phases of clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S0	The facility and associated equipment are designed and operated to be consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S1	As we do not maintain the capability to manufacture APIs (including biologics) nor finished drug products for all of our development programs, we primarily utilize contract manufacturers to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product for us.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S2	We source drug starting materials for our manufacturing activities from one or more suppliers.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S3	For the drug starting materials necessary for our proprietary drug candidate development, we have agreements for the supply of such drug components with drug manufacturers or suppliers that we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S4	However, from time to time, we source critical raw materials and services from one or a limited number of suppliers and there is a risk that if such supply or services were interrupted, it would materially harm our business.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S5	In addition, we typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S6	We also utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture APIs required for later phases of clinical development and eventual commercialization for us under all applicable laws and regulations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P179_S7	As a manufacturer of PEG reagents for the U.S. market, we are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others.
906709_18_ITEM1_P180_S0	Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time.
906709_18_ITEM1_P180_S1	We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P180_S2	We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
906709_18_ITEM1_P181_S0	Employees and Consultants As of December 31, 2017 we had 509 employees, of which 396 employees were engaged in research and development, commercial operations and quality activities and 113 employees were engaged in general administration and business development.
906709_18_ITEM1_P181_S1	Of the 509 employees, 432 were located in the U.S. and 77 were located in India.
906709_18_ITEM1_P181_S2	We have a number of employees who hold advanced degrees, such as Ph.D. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages.
906709_18_ITEM1_P181_S3	We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
906709_18_ITEM1_P182_S0	To complement our own expert professional staff, we utilize specialists in regulatory affairs, pharmacovi gilance, process engineering, manufacturing, quality assurance, clinical development and business development.

906709_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	We are providing the following cautionary discussion of risk factors, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are relevant to our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and our forward-looking statements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S3	Consequently, you should not consider this section to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties that may substantially impact our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Moreover, we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing environment.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S5	New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict the impact of all of these factors on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S6	We are highly dependent on the success of NKTR-214, our lead I-O candidate.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S7	We are executing a broad development program for NKTR-214 and clinical and regulatory outcomes for NKTR-214, if not successful, will significantly harm our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P1_S8	Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	In general, most early stage investigatory drugs, including oncology drug candidates such as NKTR-214, do not become approved drugs.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Accordingly, there is a very meaningful risk that NKTR-214 will not succeed in one or more clinical trials sufficient to support one or more regulatory approvals.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	To date, clinical outcomes from NKTR-214 have had a significant impact on our market valuation, financial position, and business prospects and we expect this to continue in future periods.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If one or more clinical studies of NKTR-214 are not successful, it would materially harm our market valuation, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	For example, upon the effective date of the strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we would be entitled to up to $1.43 billion in development milestones that are based upon clinical and regulatory successes from the NKTR-214 development program.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Failures in NKTR-214 studies could jeopardize such milestone payments.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Drug development is a long and inherently uncertain process with a high risk of failure at every stage of development.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We have a number of proprietary drug candidates and partnered drug candidates in research and development ranging from the early discovery research phase through preclinical testing and clinical trials.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Preclinical testing and clinical studies are long, expensive, difficult to design and implement and highly uncertain as to outcome.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	It will take us, or our collaborative partners, many years to conduct extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	The start or end of a clinical study is often delayed or halted due to changing regulatory requirements, manufacturing challenges, required clinical trial administrative actions, slower than anticipated patient enrollment, changing standards of care, availability or prevalence of use of a comparator drug or required prior therapy, clinical outcomes, or our and our partners financial constraints.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Drug development is a highly uncertain scientific and medical endeavor, and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage of preclinical and clinical development.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S6	Typically, there is a high rate of attrition for drug candidates in preclinical and clinical trials due to scientific feasibility, safety, efficacy, changing standards of medical care and other variables.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S7	The risk of failure increases for our drug candidates that are based on new technologies, such as the application of our advanced polymer conjugate technology to ONZEALD TM , NKTR-181, NKTR-214, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, NKTR-255, and other drug candidates currently in discovery research or preclinical development.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S8	The failure of one or more of our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S9	The risk of clinical failure for any drug candidate remains high prior to regulatory approval.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S10	A number of companies have suffered significant unforeseen failures in clinical studies due to factors such as inconclusive efficacy or safety, even after achieving preclinical proof-of-concept or positive results from earlier clinical studies that were satisfactory both to them and to reviewing regulatory authorities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P3_S11	Clinical study outcomes remain very unpredictable and it is possible that one or more of our clinical studies could fail at any time due to efficacy, safety or other important clinical findings or regulatory requirements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in later phase clinical trials of the product candidate.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We, the FDA, an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), an independent ethics committee, or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee may suspend a clinical trial at a particular trial site.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If one or more of our drug candidates fail in clinical studies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition depend significantly on the ability of our collaboration partners to successfully develop and market drugs and they may fail to do so.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Under our collaboration agreements with various pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies (other than the BMS Collaboration Agreement), our collaboration partner is generally solely responsible for:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	marketing and selling the drugs when and if they are approved.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our reliance on collaboration partners poses a number of significant risks to our business, including risks that:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	partners may terminate their agreements with us unilaterally for any or no reason, in some cases with the payment of a termination fee penalty and in other cases with no termination fee penalty.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Given these risks, the success of our current and future collaboration partnerships is highly unpredictable and can have a substantial negative or positive impact on our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If the approved drugs fail to achieve commercial success or the drugs in development fail to have positive late stage clinical outcomes sufficient to support regulatory approval in major markets, it could significantly impair our access to capital necessary to fund our research and development efforts for our proprietary drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital resources to advance our drug candidate pipeline, it would negatively impact the value of our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	We are a party to numerous collaboration agreements and other significant agreements which contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	We currently derive, and expect to derive in the foreseeable future, all of our revenue from collaboration agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	These collaboration agreements contain complex commercial terms, including:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	indemnity obligations for intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We are a party to numerous significant collaboration agreements and other strategic transaction agreements (e.g., financings and asset divestitures) that contain complex representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If we are found to have materially breached such agreements, it could subject us to substantial liabilities and harm our financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	From time to time, we are involved in litigation matters involving the interpretation and application of complex terms and conditions of our agreements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For example, in February 2015, we filed a claim against Allergan and MAP seeking monetary damages related to a dispute over the economic sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement with MAP.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	On December 12, 2017, Nektar, MAP and Allergan entered into a Settlement Agreement and Release, for which MAP paid us $15.0 million in December 2017.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	On August 14, 2015, Enzon, Inc. filed a breach of contract claim for alleged unpaid licensing fees (the Enzon Litigation ).
906709_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	On June 26, 2017, we entered into a Second Amendment to our Cross-License and Option Agreement ( Cross-License Agreement ) with Enzon in which we agreed to pay Enzon a sum of $7.0 million to satisfy all past and future obligations of royalty payments pursuant to the Cross-License Agreement and to have the Enzon Litigation dismissed.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The Enzon Litigation was dismissed with prejudice on June 30, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In 2013, we settled a breach of contract litigation matter with the Research Foundation of the State University of New York (SUNY) pursuant to which we paid an aggregate of $12.0 million.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our collaboration agreements, transaction documents, or third-party license agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If we or our partners do not obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or if the terms of any approval impose significant restrictions or limitations on use, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We or our partners may not obtain regulatory approval for drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all, or the terms of any approval (which in some countries includes pricing approval) may impose significant restrictions or limitations on use.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Drug candidates must undergo rigorous animal and human testing and an extensive review process for safety and efficacy by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The time required for obtaining regulatory decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion, at any phase of development, to terminate clinical studies, require additional clinical development or other testing, delay or withhold registration and marketing approval and mandate product withdrawals, including recalls.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	For example, while data from certain pre-specified subgroups in our BEACON study for etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) in 2015 was positive, the study did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint and the FDA and European Medicines Agency rarely approve drugs on the basis of studies that do not achieve statistical significance on the primary endpoint.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Further, while the results from the Phase 3 study of NKTR-181 were positive, NKTR-181 has Fast Track designation and we intend to file an NDA following our pre-NDA meetings with FDA, the regulatory pathway for NKTR-181 remains subject to substantial uncertainty including the amount of data required to support an approval of NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	In particular, regulations concerning and controlling the access to opioid-based pharmaceuticals are strict and there is no guarantee which scheduling category will apply to NKTR-181 if regulatory approval is achieved.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Further, regulatory authorities have the discretion to analyze data using their own methodologies that may differ from those used by us or our partners, which could lead such authorities to arrive at different conclusions regarding the safety or efficacy of a drug candidate.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S7	In addition, undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restricted label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by regulatory authorities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P16_S8	For example, AstraZeneca will be conducting a post-marketing, observational epidemiological study comparing MOVANTIK to other treatments of OIC in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain and the results of this study could at some point in the future negatively impact the labeling, regulatory status, and commercial potential of MOVANTIK .
906709_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Even if we or our partners receive regulatory approval of a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Our partnered drugs that have obtained regulatory approval, and the manufacturing processes for these products, are subject to continued review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Discovery from such review and inspection of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on marketed products or on us, including withdrawal or recall of such products from the market, suspension of related manufacturing operations or a more restricted label.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The failure to obtain timely regulatory approval of product candidates, any product marketing limitations or a product withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We have substantial future capital requirements and there is a risk we may not have access to sufficient capital to meet our current business plan.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If we do not receive substantial milestone or royalty payments from our existing collaboration agreements, execute new high value collaborations or other arrangements, or are unable to raise additional capital in one or more financing transactions, we would be unable to continue our current level of investment in research and development.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and investments in marketable securities valued at approximately $353.2 million and had debt of $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, as described above and in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with BMS under which BMS agreed to pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion and a share purchase agreement under which BMS agreed to purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The closings under the two agreements, subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions, are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	While we believe that our cash position will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months, our future capital requirements will depend upon numerous unpredictable factors, including:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	disputes concerning patents, proprietary rights, or license and collaboration agreements that negatively impact our receipt of milestone payments or royalties or require us to make significant payments arising from licenses, settlements, adverse judgments or ongoing royalties.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A significant multi-year capital commitment is required to advance our drug candidates through the various stages of research and development in order to generate sufficient data to enable high value collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments or to successfully achieve regulatory approval.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In the event we do not enter into any new collaboration partnerships with significant upfront payments and we choose to continue our later stage research and development programs, we may need to pursue financing alternatives, including dilutive equity-based financings, such as an offering of convertible debt or common stock, which would dilute the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders and could significantly lower the market value of our common stock.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If sufficient capital is not available to us or is not available on commercially reasonable terms, it could require us to delay or reduce one or more of our research and development programs.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If we are unable to sufficiently advance our research and development programs, it could substantially impair the value of such programs and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	While we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have not been able to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, there is a risk that a technique could be discovered in the future to convert NKTR-181 into a rapid-acting and more abusable opioid, which would significantly diminish the value of this drug candidate.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	An important objective of our NKTR-181 drug development program is to create a unique opioid molecule that does not rapidly enter a patient s central nervous system and therefore has the potential to be less susceptible to abuse than alternative opioid therapies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	To date, we have conducted numerous experiments using laboratory and home-based chemistry techniques that have been unable to convert NKTR-181 into a rapidly-acting, more abusable form of opioid.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P21_S7	In the future, an alternative chemistry technique, process or method of administration, or combination thereof, may be discovered to enable the conversion of NKTR-181 into a more abusable opioid, which could significantly and negatively impact the commercial potential or diminish the value of NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The comm ercial potential of a drug candidate in development is difficult to predict.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If the market size for a new drug is significantly smaller than we anticipate, it could significantly and negatively impact our revenue, results of operations and financial condit ion.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	It is very difficult to estimate the commercial potential of product candidates due to important factors such as safety and efficacy compared to other available treatments, including potential generic drug alternatives with similar efficacy profiles, changing standards of care, third party payer reimbursement standards, patient and physician preferences, drug scheduling status, the availability of competitive alternatives that may emerge either during the long drug development process or after commercial introduction, and the availability of generic versions of our product candidates following approval by regulatory authorities based on the expiration of regulatory exclusivity or our inability to prevent generic versions from coming to market by asserting our patents.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In particular, regulations concerning and controlling the access to opioid-based pharmaceuticals are strict and there is no guarantee which scheduling category will apply to NKTR-181 if regulatory approval is achieved.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If due to one or more of these risks the market potential for a drug candidate is lower than we anticipated, it could significantly and negatively impact the commercial terms of any collaboration partnership potential for such drug candidate or, if we have already entered into a collaboration for such drug candidate, the revenue potential from royalty and milestone payments could be significantly diminished and this would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	We also depend on our relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and the commercialization of product candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Poor performance by these companies, or disputes with these companies, could negatively impact our revenue and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If we are unable to establish and maintain collaboration partnerships on attractive commercial terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S6	We intend to continue to seek partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners to fund a portion of our research and development capital requirements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S7	The timing of new collaboration partnerships is difficult to predict due to availability of clinical data, the outcomes from our clinical studies, the number of potential partners that need to complete due diligence and approval processes, the definitive agreement negotiation process and numerous other unpredictable factors that can delay, impede or prevent significant transactions.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S8	If we are unable to find suitable partners or negotiate collaboration arrangements with favorable commercial terms with respect to our existing and future drug candidates or the licensing of our intellectual property, or if any arrangements we negotiate, or have negotiated, are terminated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P23_S9	Preliminary and interim data from our clinical studies that we announce or publish from time to time are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data and may change as more patient data become available.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	From time to time, we publish preliminary or interim data from our clinical studies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Preliminary data remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Interim data are also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As a result, preliminary and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Material adverse changes in the final data could significantly harm our business prospects.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Delays in clinical studies are common and have many causes, and any significant delay in clinical studies being conducted by us or our partners could result in delay in regulatory approvals and jeopardize the ability to proceed to commercialization.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S6	We or our partners may experience delays in clinical trials of drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S7	We have ongoing trials evaluating NKTR-214 including a trial evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment with BMS s Opdivo (nivolumab) as well as other ongoing and planned combination trials.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S8	We also have an ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation study for NKTR-358 under our collaboration with Lilly, including an on-going dose-finding trial of NKTR-358 to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in healthy subjects, and a multiple-ascending dose trial expected to be initiated in the first half of 2018 to evaluate NKTR-358 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S9	We also have ongoing trials with our partners for the following: Halozyme has trials in Pancreatic, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and other multiple tumor types in Phase 1, 2, and 3 development.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S10	These and other clinical studies may not begin on time, enroll a sufficient number of patients or be completed on schedule, if at all.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P24_S11	Clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	changes in regulatory authorities policies or guidance applicable to our drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	If the initiation or completion of any of the planned clinical studies for our drug candidates is delayed for any of the above or other reasons, the regulatory approval process would be delayed and the ability to commercialize and commence sales of these drug candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We may not be able to obtain intellectual property licenses related to the development of our drug candidates on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Numerous pending and issued U.S. and foreign patent rights and other proprietary rights owned by third parties relate to pharmaceutical compositions, methods of preparation and manufacturing, and methods of use and administration.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We cannot predict with any certainty which, if any, patent references will be considered relevant to our or our collaboration partners technology or drug candidates by authorities in the various jurisdictions where such rights exist, nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	In certain cases, we have existing licenses or cross-licenses with third parties; however, the scope and adequacy of these licenses is very uncertain and can change substantially during long development and commercialization cycles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical products.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license to any technology that we determine we need on reasonable terms, if at all, or that we could develop or otherwise obtain alternate technology.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	If we are required to enter into a license with a third party, our potential economic benefit for the products subject to the license will be diminished.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P27_S5	If a license is not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may be prevented from developing and commercializing the drug, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P27_S6	If any of our pending patent applications do not issue, or are deemed invalid following issuance, we may lose valuable intellectual property protection.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as ours, are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We own more than 250 U.S. and 800 foreign patents and have a number of pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technologies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	There can be no assurance that patents that have issued will be held valid and enforceable in a court of law.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Even for patents that are held valid and enforceable, the legal process associated with obtaining such a judgment is time consuming and costly.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Additionally, issued patents can be subject to opposition or other proceedings that can result in the revocation of the patent or maintenance of the patent in amended form (and potentially in a form that renders the patent without commercially relevant and/or broad coverage).
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Further, our competitors may be able to circumvent and otherwise design around our patents.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S6	Even if a patent is issued and enforceable, because development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays, patents may expire early and provide only a short period of protection, if any, following the commercialization of products encompassed by our patents.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S7	We may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which could result in a loss of the patent and/or substantial cost to us.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S8	We have filed patent applications, and plan to file additional patent applications, covering various aspects of our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technologies and our proprietary product candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P28_S9	There can be no assurance that the patent applications for which we apply would actually issue as patents, or do so with commercially relevant and/or broad coverage.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The scope of our claim coverage can be critical to our ability to enter into licensing transactions with third parties and our right to receive royalties from our collaboration partnerships.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind the date of such discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first inventor of inventions covered by our patents or patent applications.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be the first to file a patent application directed to an invention.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In those instances where we seek an intellectual property license from another, we may not be able to obtain the license on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, thereby raising concerns on our abilit y to freely commercialize our technologies or products.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	We are involved in legal proceedings and may incur substantial litigation costs and liabilities that will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	From time to time, third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we or our partners infringe their proprietary rights, such as patents and trade secrets, or have otherwise breached our obligations to them.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	A third party often bases its assertions on a claim that its patents cover our technology platform or drug candidates or that we have misappropriated its confidential or proprietary information.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Similar assertions of infringement could be based on future patents that may issue to third parties.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	In certain of our agreements with our partners, we are obligated to indemnify and hold harmless our collaboration partners from intellectual property infringement, product liability and certain other claims, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and liability if we are called upon to defend ourselves and our partners against any claims.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	If a third party obtains injunctive or other equitable relief against us or our partners, they could effectively prevent us, or our partners, from developing or commercializing, or deriving revenue from, certain drugs or drug candidates in the U.S. and abroad.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Costs associated with litigation, substantial damage claims, indemnification claims or royalties paid for licenses from third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	We are involved in legal proceedings where we or other third parties are enforcing or seeking intellectual property rights, invalidating or limiting patent rights that have already been allowed or issued, or otherwise asserting proprietary rights through one or more potential legal remedies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	For example, we are currently involved in a German litigation proceeding whereby Bayer is seeking co-ownership rights in certain of our patent filings pending at the European Patent Office covering, among other things, PEGylated Factor VIII which we have exclusively licensed to Baxalta.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The subject matter of our patent filings in this proceeding relates to Bayer s PEGylated recombinant Factor VIII compound, BAY 94-9027.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	We believe that Bayer s claim to an ownership interest in these patent filings is without merit and are vigorously defending sole and exclusive ownership rights to this intellectual property.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P33_S4	In addition, Bayer has filed claims in the U.S. against Baxalta and Nektar.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P33_S5	In one U.S. proceeding, Bayer alleges ADYNOVATE infringes a Bayer patent.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P33_S6	In another U.S. proceeding, Bayer is seeking a declaratory judgement that BAY 94-9027 does not infringe specified Nektar patents or in the alternative that the specified patents are invalid.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	As part of its intellectual property litigation strategy relating to PEGylated Factor VIII products, Nektar has also filed claims against Bayer.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We are also regularly involved in opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office where third parties seek to invalidate or limit the scope of our allowed European patent applications covering (among other things) our drugs and platform technologies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	The cost to us in initiating or defending any litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management s attention.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could delay our research and development efforts or result in financial implications either in terms of seeking license arrangements or payment of damages or royalties.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Our manufacturing operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to laws and other governmental regulatory requirements, which, if not met, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	We and our contract manufacturers are required in certain cases to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), including cGMP guidelines applicable to active pharmaceutical ingredients, and with laws and regulations governing manufacture and distribution of controlled substances, and are subject to inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions administering such requirements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S6	We anticipate periodic regulatory inspections of our drug manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our contract manufacturers for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Any failure to follow and document our or our contract manufacturers adherence to such cGMP and other laws and governmental regulations or satisfy other manufacturing and product release regulatory requirements may disrupt our ability to meet our manufacturing obligations to our customers, lead to significant delays in the availability of products for commercial use or clinical study, result in the termination or hold on a clinical study or delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S8	Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may also result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures, administrative detention, or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S9	Regulatory inspections could result in costly manufacturing changes or facility or capital equipment upgrades to satisfy the FDA that our manufacturing and quality control procedures are in substantial compliance with cGMP.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P34_S10	Manufacturing delays, for us or our contract manufacturers, pending resolution of regulatory deficiencies or suspensions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	If we or current or future collaborators or service providers fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we or they could be subject to enforcement actions and civil or criminal penalties.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Although we do not currently have any products on the market, once we begin commercializing our drug candidates, we will be subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal and state governments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our therapeutic candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Ensuring that our future business arrangements with third-parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could involve substantial costs.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	If our operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, we may be subject to penalties, including civil or criminal penalties, monetary damages, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, or exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could adversely affect financial results.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Any action against us for an alleged or suspected violation could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and could divert our management s attention from the operation of our business, even if our defense is successful.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	In addition, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations may be costly to us in terms of money, time and resources.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P38_S5	If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to manufacture drugs or drug substances in sufficient quantities that meet applicable quality standards, it could delay clinical studies, result in reduced sales or constitute a breach of our contractual obligations, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	commercial sales of our or our collaboration partners products.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As a result, we could incur substantial costs and damages and any product sales or royalty revenue that we would otherwise be entitled to receive could be reduced, delayed or eliminated.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	In some cases, we rely on contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply drug product for our clinical studies and those of our collaboration partners.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Pharmaceutical manufacturing of drugs and devices involves significant risks and uncertainties related to the demonstratio n of adequate stability, sufficient purification of the drug substance and drug product, the identification and elimination of impurities, optimal formulations, process and analytical methods validations, device performance and challenges in controlling fo r all of these variables.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We have faced and may in the future face significant difficulties, delays and unexpected expenses as we validate third party contract manufacturers required for drug and device supply to support our clinical studies and the clinic al studies and products of our collaboration partners.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Failure by us or our contract manufacturers to supply drug product or devices in sufficient quantities that meet all applicable quality requirements could result in supply shortages for our clinical st udies or the clinical studies and commercial activities of our collaboration partners.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P41_S3	Such failures could significantly and materially delay clinical trials and regulatory submissions or result in reduced sales, any of which could significantly harm our b usiness prospects, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Building and validating large scale clinical or commercial-scale manufacturing facilities and processes, recruiting and training qualified personnel and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals is complex, expensive and time consuming.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In the past, we have encountered challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet the requirements of large scale clinical trials without making modifications to the drug formulation, which may cause significant delays in clinical development.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Drug and device combination products are particularly complex, expensive and time-consuming to develop due to the number of variables involved in the final product design, including ease of patient and doctor use, maintenance of clinical efficacy, reliability and cost of manufacturing, regulatory approval requirements and standards and other important factors.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	There continues to be substantial and unpredictable risk and uncertainty related to manufacturing and supply until such time as the commercial supply chain is validated and proven.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	We purchase some of the starting material for drugs and drug candidates from a single source or a limited number of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial loss of revenue and contract liability to third parties.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We often face very limited supply of a critical raw material that can only be obtained from a single, or a limited number of, suppliers, which could cause production delays, clinical trial delays, substantial lost revenue opportunities or contract liabilities to third parties.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	For example, there are only a limited number of qualified suppliers, and in some cases single source suppliers, for the raw materials included in our PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate drug formulations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	Any interruption in supply or failure to procure such raw materials on commercially feasible terms could harm our business by delaying our clinical trials, impeding commercialization of approved drugs or increasing our costs.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, which can result in significant fluctuation in our revenue from period to period, and our past revenue is therefore not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	Our revenue is exclusively derived from our collaboration agreements, from which we receive upfront fees, contract research payments, milestone and other contingent payments based on clinical progress, regulatory progress or net sales achievements, royalties and manufacturing revenue.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S6	Significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue can result from significant payments based on the execution of new collaboration agreements, the timing of clinical outcomes, regulatory approval, commercial launch or the achievement of certain annual sales thresholds.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P44_S7	The amount of our revenue derived from collaboration agreements in any given period will depend on a number of unpredictable factors, including our ability to find and maintain suitable collaboration partners, the timing of the negotiation and conclusion of collaboration agreements with such partners, whether and when we or our collaboration partners achieve clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, the timing of regulatory approvals in one or more major markets, reimbursement levels by private and government payers, and the market introduction of new drugs or generic versions of the approved drug, as well as other factors.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The application of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which will apply beginning in the first quarter of 2018, may have a material impact on revenue recognition under our collaboration agreements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Our past revenue generated from collaboration agreements is not necessarily indicative of our future revenue.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	If any of our existing or future collaboration partners fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture or ultimately commercialize any product candidate under our collaboration agreement, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	If we are unable either to create sales, marketing and distribution capabilitie s or to enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions, we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates successfully.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	We currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	To commercialize any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval for commercialization, we must either develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, which would be expensive and time consuming, or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties to perform these services.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	If we decide to market our products directly, we must commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products directly or indirectly with our partners include:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating and sustaining an independent sales and marketing organization.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we, or our partners through our collaborations, are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty commercializing our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S1	To the extent we rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established sales, marketing and distribution systems to market our products, we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S2	To the extent that we enter into co-promotion or other arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties, which may not be successful and over which we have little or no control important examples of this risk include MOVANTIK partnered with AstraZeneca and ADYNOVATE (previously referred to as BAX 855) partnered with Baxalta.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S3	In the event that we market our products without a partner, we would be required to build a sales and marketing organization and infrastructure, which would require a significant investment, and we may not be successful in building this organization and infrastructure in a timely or efficient manner.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S4	We rely on trade secret protection and other unpatented proprietary rights for important proprietary technologies, and any loss of such rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S5	We rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S6	No assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S7	In addition, unpatented proprietary rights, including trade secrets and know-how, can be difficult to protect and may lose their value if they are independently developed by a third party or if their secrecy is lost.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S8	Any loss of trade secret protection or other unpatented proprietary rights could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S9	We expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P49_S10	For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported a net loss of $96.7 million.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	If and when we achieve profitability depends upon a number of factors, including the timing and recognition of milestone and other contingent payments and royalties received, the timing of revenue under our collaboration agreements, the amount of investments we make in our proprietary product candidates and the regulatory approval and market success of our product candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Other factors that will affect whether we achieve and sustain profitability include our ability, alone or together with our partners, to:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	maintain sufficient funds to finance our activities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If government and private insurance programs do not provide payment or reimbursement for our partnered products or proprietary products, those products will not be widely accepted, which would have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our partnered and proprietary products that have received regulatory approval will depend in part on market acceptance among physicians and patients, pricing approvals by government authorities and the availability of coverage and payment or reimbursement from third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P52_S2	However, eligibility for coverage does not necessarily signify that a drug candidate will be adequately reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers costs related to research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Therefore, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and pricing approvals for, and the payment or reimbursement status of, newly approved healthcare products.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Moreover, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before regulatory agencies approve our proposed products for marketing and could further limit coverage or pricing approvals for, and reimbursement of, our products from government authorities and third-party payers.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	For example, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 which enacted a number of reforms to expand access to health insurance while also reducing or constraining the growth of healthcare spending, enhancing remedies against fraud and abuse, adding new transparency requirements for healthcare industries, and imposing new taxes on fees on healthcare industry participants, among other policy reforms.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S4	Federal agencies, Congress and state legislatures have continued to show interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S5	In addition, in recent years, Congress has enacted various laws seeking to reduce the federal debt level and contain healthcare expenditures, and the Medicare and other healthcare programs are frequently identified as potential targets for spending cuts.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S6	New government legislation or regulations related to pricing or other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system as well as a government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing for, or provide adequate coverage or reimbursement of, our products hold the potential to severely limit market opportunities of such products.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S7	We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S8	We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our proprietary product candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S9	We rely heavily on these parties for the successful execution of our clinical trials.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S10	Though we are ultimately responsible for the results of their activities, many aspects of their activities are beyond our control.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S11	For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trials, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or communicate issues regarding our products to us in an untimely manner.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S12	Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S13	The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and requirements governing clinical trials or the failure of third parties to properly conduct our clinical trials could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P53_S14	Significant competition for our polymer conjugate chemistry technology platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates could make our technologies, products or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Our advanced polymer conjugate chemistry platforms and our partnered and proprietary products and product candidates compete with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Competitors of our polymer conjugate chemistry technologies include Biogen Inc., Savient Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dr. Reddy s Laboratories Ltd., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novo Nordisk A/S (formerly assets held by Neose Technologies, Inc.), and NOF Corporation.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies may also be developing polymer conjugation technologies or technologies that have similar impact on target drug molecules.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P54_S3	Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others are developing the technology for internal use.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	There are many competitors for our proprietary product candidates currently in developm ent.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	For MOVANTIK , there are currently several alternative therapies used to address opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD), including Symproic (naldemedine) from Shionogi and Purdue Pharma L.P., RELISTOR Subcutaneo us Injection (methylnaltrexone bromide), oral therapy Amitizia (lubiprostone), and oral and rectal over-the-counter laxatives and stool softeners such as docusate sodium, senna and milk of magnesia.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In addition, there are a number of companies developing p otential products which are in various stages of clinical development and are being evaluated for the treatment of OIC and OBD in different patient populations, including Merck Co., Inc., Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Salix Pharma ceuticals, Ltd., Purdue Pharma L.P. in collaboration with Shionogi Co., Ltd., Mundipharma Int.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Limited, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Develco Pharma GmbH, Alkermes plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Theravance, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Fo r ADYNOVATE , o n June 6, 2014, the FDA approved Biogen Idec s Fc fusion protein ELOCTATE TM for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative (surgical) management and routine prophylaxis in adults and children with Hemophilia A. Longer ac ting Factor VIII proteins based on polymer conjugation technology approaches are being pursued by Bayer Healthcare LLC (which has filed for regulatory approval in the U.S.) and Novo Nordisk (which has an ongoing Phase 3 clinical development program).
906709_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	In a ddition, technologies other than those based on Fc fusion and polymer conjugation approaches (such as gene therapy) are being pursued to treat patients with Hemophilia A. For NKTR-181, t here are numerous companies developing pain therapies designed to hav e less abuse potential primarily through formulation technologies and techniques applied to existing pain therapies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Potential competitors include Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cara Therapeutics, Inc., Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., Egalet Ltd, Elite Pharm aceuticals, Inc., Endo Health Solutions Inc., KemPharm, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., Purdue Pharma L.P., and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	For ONZEALD TM there are a number of chemotherapies and cancer therapies approved today and in various stages of clinica l development for breast cancer, including, but not limited to: Abraxane (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin bound)), Xeloda (capecitabine), Afinitor (everolimus), Doxil (doxorubicin HCl), Ellence (epirubicin), Gemza r (gemcitabine), Halaven (eribulin), Herceptin (trastuzumab), Hycamtin (topotecan), Ibrance (palbociclib), Ixempra (ixabepilone), Navelbine (vinolrebine), Iniparib, Paraplatin (carboplatin), Taxol (paclitaxel) and Taxotere (docetaxel).
906709_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Major phar maceutical or biotechnology companies with approved drugs or drugs in development for breast cancers include, but are not limited to, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Eli Lilly Co., Roche, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer Inc., Eisai Inc., a nd Sanofi Aventis S.A.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	For NKTR-214, there are numerous companies engaged in developing immunotherapies to be used alone, or in combination, to treat a wide range of oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILS, chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells, or CAR-T, cytokine-based therapies, and checkpoint inhibitors.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	Potential competitors in the TIL and CAR-T space include Kite Pharma/NCI, Ada ptimmune LLC, Celgene Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, and Novartis, Alkermes, Altor, and Armo in the cytokine-based therapies space, and Tesaro, Macrogenics, Merck, BMS, and Roche in the checkpoint inhibitor space.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	For NKTR 358, there are a number of compe titors in various stages of clinical development that are working on programs which are designed to correct the underlying immune system imbalance in the body due to autoimmune disease.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	In particular, we expect to compete with therapies that could be cytok ine-based therapies (Symbiotix, LLC and Tizona Therapeutics), regulatory T cell therapies (Targazyme, Inc., Juno Therapeutics and Tract Therapeutics, Inc.), or IL-2-based and toleragen-based therapies (Celgene Corporation, Amgen Inc., Tolera Therapeutics, Inc., and Caladrius BioSciences, Inc.).
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	There can be no assurance that we or our partners will successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize next-generation or new products that will successfully compete with those of our competitors.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	Many of our competitors have greater financial, research and development, marketing and sales, manufacturing and managerial capabilities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S4	We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S5	As a result, our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies, obtaining regulatory approval or gaining market acceptance for products before we do.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S6	These developments could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P61_S7	If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products involve inherent product liability risks.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	If product liability costs exceed our product liability insurance coverage, we may incur substantial liabilities that could have a severe negative impact on our financial position.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	Whether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	Additionally, we may not be able to maintain our clinical trial insurance or product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all, and this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims or losses.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Our internal computer systems, or those of our CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs or the theft of our confidential information or patient confidential information.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contract research organizations (CROs) and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Such events could cause interruptions of our operations.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	For instance, the loss of preclinical data or data from any future clinical trial involving our product candidates could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S4	To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information of our company or clinical patients, we could suffer or be subject to reputational harm, monetary fines, civil suits, civil penalties or criminal sanctions and requirements to disclose the breach, and other forms of liability, and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S5	Our future depends on the proper management of our current and future business operations and their associated expenses.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S6	Our business strategy requires us to manage our business to provide for the continued development and potential commercialization of our proprietary and partnered drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P63_S7	Our strategy also calls for us to undertake increased research and development activities and to manage an increasing number of relationships with partners and other third parties, while simultaneously managing the capital necessary to support this strategy.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	If we are unable to manage effectively our current operations and any growth we may experience, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	If we are unable to effectively manage our expenses, we may find it necessary to reduce our personnel-related costs through reductions in our workforce, which could harm our operations, employee morale and impair our ability to retain and recruit talent.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Furthermore, if adequate funds are not available, we may be required to obtain funds through arrangements with partners or other sources that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, products or future economic rights that we would not otherwise relinquish or require us to enter into other financing arrangements on unfavorable terms.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	We are dependent on our management team and key technical personnel, and the loss of any key manager or employee may impair our ability to develop our products effectively and may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Our success largely depends on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S5	The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees could seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S6	The relationships that our key managers have cultivated within our industry make us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S7	We are also dependent on the continued services of our technical personnel because of the highly technical nature of our products and the regulatory approval process.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S8	Because our executive officers and key employees are not obligated to provide us with continued services, they could terminate their employment with us at any time without penalty.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S9	We do not have any post-employment noncompetition agreements with any of our employees and do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executive officers or key employees.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S10	Because competition for highly qualified technical personnel is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel we need to support our operations and growth.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S11	We must attract and retain experts in the areas of clinical testing, manufacturing, research, regulatory and finance, and may need to attract and retain marketing and distribution experts and develop additional expertise in our existing personnel.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S12	We face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, research and academic institutions and other organizations for qualified personnel.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S13	Many of the organizations with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we have.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S14	Because competition for skilled personnel in our industry is intense, companies such as ours sometimes experience high attrition rates with regard to their skilled employees.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S15	Further, in making employment decisions, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options they are to receive in connection with their employment.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S16	Our equity incentive plan and employee benefit plans may not be effective in motivating or retaining our employees or attracting new employees, and significant volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S17	If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S18	If earthquakes or other catastrophic events strike, our business may be harmed.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S19	Our corporate headquarters, including a substantial portion of our research and development operations, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity and a potential terrorist target.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S20	In addition, we own facilities for the manufacture of products using our advanced polymer conjugate technologies in Huntsville, Alabama and own and lease offices in Hyderabad, India.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P64_S21	There are no backup facilities for our manufacturing operations located in Huntsville, Alabama.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	significantly disrupted and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Our collaborative partner s may also be subject to catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential conseque nces to our business, results of operations and financial condition from a major earthquake or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, sustained loss of power, terrorist activity or other disaster, and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	In a ddition, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate us for actual losses from any interruption of our business that may occur.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P65_S4	We have implemented certain anti-takeover measures, which make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P65_S5	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Further, provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S1	These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer or proxy contest, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then-current market prices.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S2	We also have a change of control severance benefit plan, which provides for certain cash severance, stock award acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S3	This severance plan could discourage a third party from acquiring us.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S4	The price of our common stock is expected to remain volatile.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S5	During the year ended December 31, 2017, based on closing prices on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $11.75 to $60.50 per share.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S6	We expect our stock price to remain volatile.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P67_S7	A variety of factors may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock, including the risks described in this section titled Risk Factors and the following:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	At times, our stock price has been volatile even in the absence of significant news or developments.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The stock prices of biotechnology companies and securities markets generally have been subject to dramatic price swings in recent years.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	The indenture governing our 7.75% senior secured notes imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	On October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The indenture governing the senior secured notes contains covenants that restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to take various actions, including, among other things:
906709_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	consummate a merger, consolidation, reorganization or business combination, sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets or other change of control transaction.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	This indenture also requires us to maintain a minimum cash and investments in marketable securities balance of $60.0 million.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	We have certain reporting obligations under the indenture regarding cash position and royalty revenue.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The indenture specifies a number of events of default, some of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among other things, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, non-payment of material judgments, loss of any material business license, criminal indictment of the Company, and certain civil forfeiture proceedings involving material assets of the Company.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Our ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Our failure to comply with our obligations could result in an event of default under our other indebtedness and the acceleration of our other indebtedness, in whole or in part, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the senior secured notes.
906709_18_ITEM1A_P74_S3	The restrictions contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.
906709_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	California We lease a 129,732 square foot facility in the Mission Bay Area of San Francisco, California (Mission Bay Facility), under an operating lease which expires in January 2030.

906709_18_ITEM5_P6_S0	The selected consolidated financial data set forth below should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the other information contained herein.
906709_18_ITEM5_P7_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on net sales of UCB s CIMZIA and Roche s MIRCERA .
906709_18_ITEM5_P7_S1	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_18_ITEM5_P7_S2	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests starting in the second quarter of 2012, we will continue to record non-cash revenue for these royalties and related non-cash interest expense.
906709_18_ITEM5_P8_S0	Operating costs and expenses in 2017 includes $16.0 million for the impairment of equipment and related costs resulting from the termination of the Amikacin Inhale development program.
906709_18_ITEM5_P9_S0	Basic and diluted net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
906709_18_ITEM5_P10_S0	The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
906709_18_ITEM5_P10_S1	Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.
906709_18_ITEM5_P10_S2	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those di scussed in this section as well as factors described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	Overview Strategic Direction of Our Business Nektar Therapeutics is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops innovative new medicines in areas of high unmet medical need.
906709_18_ITEM7_P0_S1	Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, autoimmune disease and chronic pain.
906709_18_ITEM7_P0_S2	We leverage our proprietary and proven chemistry platform to discover and design new drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM7_P0_S3	These drug candidates utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_18_ITEM7_P0_S4	We continue to make significant investments in building and advancing our pipeline of proprietary drug candidates as we believe that this is the best strategy to build stockholder value.
906709_18_ITEM7_P0_S5	Described below are certain key events and activities where we are making investments in advancing our research and development pipeline.
906709_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	On February 13, 2018, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (BMS Collaboration Agreement) with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to which we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214, our lead immuno-oncology drug candidate, in combination with BMS s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab), in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types, as well as potential combinations with other anti-cancer agents from BMS, us and third parties.
906709_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	We also entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (Purchase Agreement) with BMS, pursuant to which BMS has agreed to purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share.
906709_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	The closings under the two agreements, subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions, are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	In early 2017, we commenced a broad clinical development program for NKTR-214, our lead immuno-oncology drug candidate in combination with other immuno-oncology agents including Opdivo (nivolumab) as part of our broad Phase 1/2 clinical collaboration with BMS in five tumor types and eight potential indications, a dose-escalation study with atezolizumab, and numerous preclinical collaboration programs.
906709_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	In the last half of 2017 we completed enrollment in the dose-escalation phase of the NKTR-214 study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo (nivolumab) in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer which we call the PIVOT-02 study.
906709_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	On November 11, 2017 we announced interim data from the dose-escalation phase of the PIVOT-02 Phase 1/2 study.
906709_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	We have identified the Phase 2 dose for NKTR-214 and are currently enrolling subjects in the expansion phase of the study.
906709_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	On May 22, 2017, we announced a research collaboration that will allow Nektar and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) to evaluate NKTR-214 with five compounds from Takeda s cancer portfolio.
906709_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	On September 12, 2017, we announced that we had begun dosing in a clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of NKTR-214 in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitors, TECENTRIQ (atezolizumab) and KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab).
906709_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	In February 2017, we filed an investigational new drug (IND) application for NKTR-358, our autoimmune disease drug candidate.
906709_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	We began the Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate single-ascending doses of NKTR-358 in healthy volunteers in March 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	This study is designed to establish a range of dose levels and evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety.
906709_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	A Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2018 in lupus patients.
906709_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	On July 24, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with Lilly to co-develop NKTR-358.
906709_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	On March 20, 2017, we announced that NKTR-181, met its primary and secondary endpoints in the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study.
906709_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	On July 18, 2017, we announced positive top-line data for our pivotal human abuse potential study (the HAP study) for NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	The HAP study was designed to assess the relative oral abuse potential of NKTR-181 at its highest tested therapeutic dose as well as at the highest dose to which patients have been exposed in our long-term safety study and at a supratherapeutic dose compared to common therapeutic doses of oxycodone, a Schedule II opioid.
906709_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Following the success of the SUMMIT-07 Phase 3 efficacy study and the HAP study, we are seeking a partner to support future development and commercialization activities for NKTR-181.
906709_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	We are currently planning to file the NDA for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	We filed the IND for NKTR-262 in December 2017 and expect to begin enrolling patients in the initial Phase 1 study by the e nd of the first quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	We are also completing preclinical research for NKTR-255 with the goal of advancing this program into the clinic in 2019.
906709_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The level of our future research and development investment will depend on a number of trends and uncertainties including clinical outcomes, future studies required to advance programs to regulatory approval, and the economics related to potential future collaborations that may include up-front payments, development funding, milestones, and royalties.
906709_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	We also have significant milestone and royalty economic interests in approved drugs and drug candidates in late stage development with our collaboration partners.
906709_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	With AstraZeneca, we have a collaboration for MOVANTIK , an oral peripherally-acting mu-opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adult patients with non-cancer pain.
906709_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	MOVANTIK is approved by health authorities in the United States, European Union, and many other countries.
906709_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	We have a collaboration with Baxalta (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire plc) for ADYNOVATE , that was approved by the FDA in late 2015 for use in adults and adolescents, aged 12 years and older, who have Hemophilia A. ADYNOVATE is approved by health authorities in the United States, European Union, and many other countries.
906709_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Our business is subject to significant risks, including the risks inherent in our development efforts, the results of our clinical trials, our dependence on the marketing efforts by our collaboration partners, uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents, the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products.
906709_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	For a discussion of these and some of the other key risks and uncertainties affecting our business, see Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While the approved drugs and clinical development programs described above are key elements of our future success, we believe it is critically important that we continue to make substantial investments in our earlier-stage drug candidate pipeline.
906709_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	We have several drug candidates in earlier stage clinical development or being explored in research that we are preparing to advance into the clinic in future years.
906709_18_ITEM7_P11_S3	We are also advancing several other drug candidates in preclinical development in the areas of cancer immunotherapy, immunology, and other therapeutic indications.
906709_18_ITEM7_P11_S4	We believe that our substantial investment in research and development has the potential to create significant value if one or more of our drug candidates demonstrates positive clinical results, receives regulatory approval in one or more major markets and achieves commercial success, drug research and development is an inherently uncertain process and there is a high risk of failure at every stage prior to approval and the timing and outcome of clinical trial results are extremely difficult to predict.
906709_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Clinical development successes and failures can have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on our scientific and medical prospects, financial condition and prospects, results of operations and market value.
906709_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Historically, we have entered into a number of license and supply contracts under which we manufactured and supplied our proprietary polymer reagents on a fixed price or cost-plus basis.
906709_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Our current strategy is to manufacture and supply polymer reagents to support our proprietary drug candidates or our third-party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Key Developments and Trends in Liquidity and Capital Resources We estimate that we have working capital to fund our current business plans through at least March 1, 2019.
906709_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $353.2 million in cash and investments in marketable securities and had debt of $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes due in October 2020.
906709_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	In addition, as described above and in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2018, we entered into a collaboration agreement with BMS under which BMS will pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion and a share purchase agreement under which BMS will purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock.
906709_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	The closings under the two agreements, subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions, are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Our revenue is derived from our collaboration agreements, under which we may receive product sales revenue, royalties, license fees, milestone and other contingent payments and/or contract research payments.
906709_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The amount of upfront fees received under our license and collaboration agreements allocated to continuing obligations, such as manufacturing and supply commitments, is generally recognized ratably over our expected performance period under the arrangement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	As a result, there may be significant variations in the timing of receipt of cash payments and our recognition of revenue.
906709_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations.
906709_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	Given the uncertainties in research and development collaborations, significant judgment is required by us to determine the performance periods.
906709_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Product sales Product sales include predominantly fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners and are the result of firm purchase orders from those partners.
906709_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	The timing of shipments is based solely on the demand and requirements of our collaboration partners and is not ratable throughout the year.
906709_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Product sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreased product demand from our collaboration partner Ophthotech related to its drug candidate Fovista .
906709_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Product sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of increased product demand from Ophthotech.
906709_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	In December 2016, Ophthotech announced that two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials for Fovista failed to meet their primary endpoints.
906709_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	In the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $10.4 million of product sales to Ophthotech based on prior binding purchase commitments.
906709_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	In August 2017, Ophthotech announced that the third Fovista Phase 3 trial also failed to meet its primary endpoint and, in October 2017, our agreement with Ophthotech was terminated.
906709_18_ITEM7_P16_S3	We expect product sales in 2018 to decrease compared to 2017 primarily due to the termination of the Ophthotech agreement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P16_S4	We receive royalty revenue from certain of our collaboration partners based on their net sales of commercial products.
906709_18_ITEM7_P16_S5	Royalty revenue received in cash increased for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 compared to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due primarily to the commercial launch by AstraZeneca of MOVANTIK in the U.S. in March 2015 and MOVENTIG in the EU in August 2015 and the launch of ADYNOVATE by Baxalta in the U.S. in November 2015.
906709_18_ITEM7_P16_S6	We expect royalty revenue in 2018 will increase as compared to 2017 due to royalties we expect to receive as a result of sales growth of these partnered products.
906709_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	As part of its approval of MOVANTIK , the FDA required AstraZeneca to perform a post-marketing, observational epidemiological study comparing MOVANTIK to other treatments of OIC in patients with chronic, non-cancer pain.
906709_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	As a result, the royalty rate payable to us from net sales of MOVANTIK in the U.S. by AstraZeneca can be reduced by up to two percentage points to fund 33% of the external costs incurred by AstraZeneca to fund such post approval study, subject to a $35.0 million aggregate cap.
906709_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2017, our cumulative share of the post-approval study expenses has been $0.7 million.
906709_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Any costs incurred by AstraZeneca can only be recovered by the reduction of the royalty paid to us.
906709_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	In no case can amounts be recovered by the reduction of a contingent payment due from AstraZeneca to us or through a payment from us to AstraZeneca.
906709_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA .
906709_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period.
906709_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	As a result of this liability accounting, even though the royalties from UCB and Roche are remitted directly to the purchaser of these royalty interests, we will continue to record revenue for these royalties.
906709_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	We expect non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA in 2018 to increase marginally compared to 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	License, collaboration and other revenue License, collaboration and other revenue includes the recognition of upfront payments, milestone and other contingent payments received in connection with our license and collaboration agreements and certain research and development activities.
906709_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	The level of license, collaboration and other revenue depends in part upon the estimated amortization period of the upfront payments, the achievement of milestones and other contingent events, the continuation of existing collaborations, the amount of research and development work, and entering into new collaboration agreements, if any.
906709_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	License, collaboration and other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the recognition of $130.1 million of the $150.0 million upfront payment we received in September 2017 from our collaboration agreement with Lilly for NKTR-358 as described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
906709_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	In addition, in the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $38.0 million related to the termination of our collaboration agreements with Bayer, Ophthotech, and Daiichi as described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
906709_18_ITEM7_P19_S4	These increases in 2017 were partially offset by the recognition of $28.0 million in March 2016 for our 40% share of the $70.0 million sublicense payment received by AstraZeneca from Kirin.
906709_18_ITEM7_P19_S5	License, collaboration and other revenue decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the recognition in March 2015 of the $100.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca as a result of the U.S. commercial launch of MOVANTIK and the $40.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca in August 2015 as a result of the EU commercial launch of MOVENTIG partially offset by the recognition in 2016 of a $28.0 million payment received from AstraZeneca described above.
906709_18_ITEM7_P19_S6	We currently expect, subject to our adoption of ASC 606 and completion of our determination of revenue to be recognized related to the BMS Collaboration Agreement executed in February 2018, that our license, collaboration and other revenue from existing collaboration agreements will increase in 2018 compared to 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The timing and future success of our drug development programs and those of our collaboration partners are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
906709_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for discussion of the risks associated with the complex nature of our collaboration agreements.
906709_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area:
906709_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	The increase in revenue attributable to the United States for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to the recognition of $130.1 million of the $150.0 million upfront payment we received in September 2017 from our collaboration agreement with Lilly for NKTR-358.
906709_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The decrease in revenue attributable to European countries for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily attributable to decreased milestone and other contingent payments from our existing European based collaboration partners, including the recognition in 2015 of a total of $140.0 million payments from AstraZeneca in connection with its commercial launches of MOVANTIK described above.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	As noted above, our strategy is to manufacture and supply polymer reagents to sup port our proprietary drug candidates or our third-party collaborators where we have a strategic development and commercialization relationship or where we derive substantial economic benefit.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	We have elected to only enter into and maintain those manufacturing relationships associated with long-term collaboration agreements which include multiple sources of revenue, which we view holistically and in aggregate.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	We have a predominantly fixed cost base associated with our manufacturing activities, which generally results in similar total cost of goods sold amounts each year.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	As a result, our product gross profit and margin are significantly impacted by the mix and volume of products sold in each period.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S4	Cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2016.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S5	Cost of goods sold decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the mix of product sales, which resulted in decreases to cost of goods sold even though product sales increased during the same period.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S6	The decrease in product gross profit and product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to decreased product sales as well as a less favorable product mix in 2017 compared to 2016.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S7	In particular, we have a manufacturing arrangement with a partner that includes a fixed price which is less than the fully burdened manufacturing cost for the reagent, and we expect this situation to continue with this partner in future years.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S8	There were more shipments to this partner relative to shipments to other customers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S9	The improvement in product gross profit and product gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to a more favorable product mix.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S10	In particular, the increased demand from our collaboration partners in 2016 resulted in product sales where we have a relatively higher gross margin.
906709_18_ITEM7_P23_S11	This increased margin was partially offset by the manufacturing arrangement mentioned above.
906709_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	In addition to product sales from reagent materials supplied to the partner where our sales are less than our fully burdened manufacturing cost, we also receive royalty revenue from this collaboration.
906709_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the royalty revenue from this collaboration exceeded the related negative gross profit.
906709_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	We expect product gross margin to continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the level and mix of manufacturing orders from our customers.
906709_18_ITEM7_P24_S3	We currently expect product gross margin to decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 and gross margin may be negative in 2018 as a result of the anticipated decrease in product sales described above.
906709_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	Research and development expense consists primarily of clinical study costs, direct costs of outside research, materials, supplies, licenses and fees as well as personnel costs (including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation).
906709_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Research and development expense also includes certain overhead allocations consisting of support and facilities-related costs.
906709_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	Where we perform research and development activities under a clinical joint development collaboration, such as our collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we record the cost reimbursement from our partner as a reduction to research and development expense when reimbursement amounts are due to us under the agreement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	Research and development expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and includes increased costs for our clinical development of NKTR-214, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, and preclinical activities for NKTR-255.
906709_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	In addition, the increase in research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 includes increased costs related to personnel and outside services.
906709_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 p rimarily due to costs incurred in our NKTR-214 clinical and NKTR-358 pre-clinical programs as well as increased headcount costs, partially offset by a decrease in our ONZEALD TM program costs.
906709_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	We utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development and research programs.
906709_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	The following table shows expenses incurred for clinical and regulatory services, clinical supplies, and preclinical study support provided by third parties as well as direct materials costs for each of our drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of personnel, facilities and other indirect costs (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	Clinical Study Status definitions are provided in the chart found in Part I, Item 1.
906709_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	We partnered this program with Bayer Healthcare LLC in August 2007.
906709_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	As part of the Novartis Pulmonary Asset Sale in 2008, we retained an exclusive license to this technology for the development and commercialization of this drug candidate.
906709_18_ITEM7_P29_S2	In November 2017, Bayer announced that its two Phase 3 studies of Amikacin Inhale both failed to meet their primary and secondary endpoints and, in December 2017, Bayer terminated our collaboration to develop Amikacin Inhale.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	We expect research and development expense to increase significantly in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of the development of NKTR-214 under the BMS Collaboration Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S1	In 2018, we plan to continue and expand a broad clinical development program for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S2	Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214 in combination with BMS s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab), in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types, as well as potential combinations with other anti-cancer agents from BMS, us and third parties.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S3	In addition, we are collaborating with Lilly to develop NKTR-358 and are continuing its Phase 1 clinical development program in 2018.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S4	We have initiated start-up activities on our Phase 1/2 program for NKTR-262 and plan to enroll the initial patients in the second quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S5	We plan to file an IND for NKTR-255 in 2019.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S6	The timing and amount of our future clinical investments will vary significantly based upon our evaluation of ongoing clinical results and the structure, timing, and scope of potential collaboration partnerships (if any) for these programs.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S7	We plan to file an NDA for NKTR-181 in the first half of 2018 and plan to pursue a collaboration to secure a development and commercialization partner to fund further development for NKTR-181 through direct program funding, up-front payments, milestones, or a combination thereof.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S8	In addition, we expect non-cash stock-based compensation expense to increase in 2018 due to the increase in our stock price.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S9	In addition to our drug candidates that we plan to evaluate in clinical development during 2018 and beyond, we believe it is vitally important to continue our substantial investment in a pipeline of new drug candidates to continue to build the value of our drug candidate pipeline and our business.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S10	Our discovery research organization is identifying new drug candidates by applying our polymer conjugation technology platform to a wide range of molecule classes, including small molecules and large proteins, peptides and antibodies, across multiple therapeutic areas.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S11	We plan to continue to advance our most promising early research drug candidates into preclinical development with the objective to advance these early stage research programs to human clinical studies over the next several years.
906709_18_ITEM7_P30_S12	Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion.
906709_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	tested in numerous preclinical s afety, toxicology and efficacy studies.
906709_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	We then conduct clinical studies for our drug candidates that take several years to complete.
906709_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	The cost and time required to complete clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a clinical development prog ram as a result of a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
906709_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, approvals from government health authorities.
906709_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	Furthermore, our strategy includes the potential of entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates such as those collaborations that we have already completed for NKTR-214 and MOVANTIK .
906709_18_ITEM7_P33_S1	In these situations, the clinical development program and process for a drug candidate and the estimated completion date will largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control.
906709_18_ITEM7_P33_S2	We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements.
906709_18_ITEM7_P33_S3	The risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Item 1A Risk Factors.
906709_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from a collaboration arrangement or the commercialization of a drug candidate.
906709_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	General and administrative expense includes the cost of administrative staffing, business development, marketing, finance, and legal activities.
906709_18_ITEM7_P35_S1	General and administrative expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to increased costs related to personnel, facilities and outside services.
906709_18_ITEM7_P35_S2	General and administrative expense increased marginally during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.
906709_18_ITEM7_P35_S3	In 2018, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase compared to 2017, including an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense due to the increase in our stock price.
906709_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decrease d marginally compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 due to decreased interest expense from our capital leases.
906709_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to our secured notes transaction completed in October 2015.
906709_18_ITEM7_P36_S2	As is further described in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due October 2020 and used a p ortion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P36_S3	Interest on the 7.75% senior secured notes is calculated based on actual days outstanding over a 360-day year.
906709_18_ITEM7_P36_S4	W e expect interest expense in 2018 to decrease marginally compared to 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P36_S5	Non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 decreased marginally as compared to the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, due to the decrease in 2017 and 2016, respectively, of the average balance of the related liability as that liability balance amortizes.
906709_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	On February 24, 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments on CIMZIA and MIRCERA in exchange for $124.0 million.
906709_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	As described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, this royalty sale transaction has been recorded as a liability that amortizes over the estimated royalty payment period as CIMZIA and MIRCERA royalties are remitted directly to the purchaser.
906709_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	We impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the effective interest rate, which we estimated to be approximately 17% from inception to 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	During the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as a result of increases in the forecasted sales of CIMZIA , our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement increased to approximately 17.6%, which results in a prospective interest rate of 21%.
906709_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the estimated interest rate, in particular, the amount and timing of royalty payments from future net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , and we will assess this estimate on a periodic basis.
906709_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	As a result, future interest rates could differ significantly and any such change in interest rate will be adjusted prospectively.
906709_18_ITEM7_P37_S6	Unless we adjust our estimated interest rate, we expect non-cash interest expense on the liability related to sale of future royalties for 2018 to increase marginally compared with 2017 as a result of the increase of the estimated prospective interest rate noted above.
906709_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	Impairment of equipment and other costs for terminated program As described in Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2017, Bayer terminated our collaboration to develop Amikacin Inhale.
906709_18_ITEM7_P38_S1	As a result of the termination of the program, in the year ended December 31, 2017, we wrote off program-specific manufacturing equipment with a net book value of $15.1 million.
906709_18_ITEM7_P38_S2	In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $0.9 million of other program termination costs related to our manufacturing obligations.
906709_18_ITEM7_P38_S3	Loss on Extinguishment of Debt As a result of the secured note financing transaction in October 2015 discussed above, in the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized a $14.1 million loss on extinguishment of our 12% notes, which consists of a $11.3 million redemption premium payment, $1.2 million of incremental interest paid at redemption to the 12% note holders and the write-off of $1.6 million of unamortized issuance costs on the 12% notes.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales, royalties and strategic collaboration agreements, as well as public offering and private placements of debt and equity securities.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S1	At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $353.2 million in cash and investments in marketable securities and had debt of $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes due in October 2020.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S2	We estimate that we have working capital to fund our current business plans through at least March 1, 2019.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S3	We expect the clinical development of our proprietary drug candidates including NKTR-214, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, NKTR-255, NKTR-181, and ONZEALD TM will continue to require significant investment in order to continue to advance in clinical development with the objective of entering into a collaboration partnership or obtaining regulatory approval.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S4	In the past, we have received a number of significant payments from collaboration agreements and other significant transactions.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S5	In July 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement for NKTR-358 with Lilly, under which we received a $150.0 million upfront payment.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S6	Subject to the closing of the BMS Collaboration Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, BMS will pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion and purchase $850.0 million of shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $102.60 per share.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S7	We have no credit facility or any other sources of committed capital.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S8	In the future, we expect to receive increasing royalties from commercial sales of products such as MOVANTIK , MOVENTIG and ADYNOVATE as they continue to increase sales.
906709_18_ITEM7_P39_S9	We also expect potential substantial payments from future collaboration transactions if drug candidates in our pipeline achieve positive clinical or regulatory outcomes.
906709_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	ADYNOVATE , clinical program outcomes, whether, when and on what terms we are able to enter into new collaboration transactions, expenses being higher than anticipated, unplanned expenses, cash receipts being lower than anticipated, and th e need to satisfy contingent liabilities, including litigation matters and indemnification obligations.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The availability and terms of various financing alternatives substantially depend on many factors including the success or failure of drug development programs in our pipeline, including NKTR-214, NKTR-181, NKTR-358, NKTR-262, and NKTR-255 as well as other early stage development programs.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S1	The availability and terms of financing alternatives and any future significant payments from existing or new collaborations depend on the positive outcome of ongoing or planned clinical studies, whether we or our partners are successful in obtaining regulatory authority approvals in major markets, and if approved, the commercial success of these drugs, as well as general capital market conditions.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S2	We will pursue various financing alternatives as needed to continue to fund our research and development activities and to fund the expansion of our business as appropriate.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S3	Due to the potential for adverse developments in the credit markets, we may experience reduced liquidity with respect to some of our investments in marketable securities.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S4	These investments are generally held to maturity, which, in accordance with our investment policy, is less than two years.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S5	However, if the need arises to liquidate such securities before maturity, we may experience losses on liquidation.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S6	At December 31, 2017, the average time to maturity of the investments held in our portfolio was approximately eight months.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S7	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S8	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S9	Cash flows from operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $80.4 million, which includes $225.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $19.6 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes and the $12.5 million termination payment to Daiichi in December 2017 related to our ONZEALD TM collaboration arrangement in Europe, partially offset by the receipt of $150.0 million upfront payment in September 2017 from our collaboration agreement with Lilly for NKTR-358, the receipt of $12.0 million in November 2017 related to our collaboration agreement with Baxalta and the receipt of $15.0 million in December 2017 resulting from a settlement agreement related to our collaboration agreement with MAP Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S10	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $117.0 million, which includes $158.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $19.7 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $31.0 million of payments from AstraZeneca related to its sub-license to Kirin, the receipt of a $20.0 million upfront payment in August 2016 from Daiichi related to our ONZEALD TM collaboration arrangement in Europe, as well as the receipt of a $10.0 million milestone in January 2016 from our Baxalta collaboration agreement, which was recorded in accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S11	Cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $73.1 million, which includes $196.3 million of net operating cash uses as well as $18.8 million for interest payments on our senior secured notes, partially offset by the receipt of $142.0 million of milestones and other contingent payments from collaboration agreements.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S12	We expect that cash flows used in operating activities, excluding upfront, milestone and other contingent payments received, if any, will increase in the full year of 2018 compared to 2017 primarily as a result of increased research and development expenses.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S13	Cash flows from investing activities We paid $9.7 million, $6.4 million, and $11.2 million to purchase property, plant and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S14	We expect our capital expenditures in 2018 to increase compared to 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S15	Restricted cash of $25.0 million was required to be maintained in a separate account until July 1, 2015 under the terms of our 12% senior secured notes due July 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P41_S16	This restriction expired on July 1, 2015 and the restricted funds were returned to us.
906709_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	Cash flows from financing activities On October 24, 2016, we completed the issuance and sale of 14,950,000 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering with total proceeds of approximately $189.7 million after deducting the underwriting commissions and discounts of approximately $12.1 million.
906709_18_ITEM7_P42_S1	In addition, we incurred approximately $0.4 million in legal and accounting fees, filing fees, and other costs in connection with this offering.
906709_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	On October 5, 2015, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior secured notes due 2020.
906709_18_ITEM7_P43_S1	The notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per annum payable in cash quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year.
906709_18_ITEM7_P43_S2	In connection with the issuance of the notes, we paid $8.7 million of transaction and facility fees paid to the purchasers of the notes and other direct costs, which were capitalized as a debt discount and issuance costs and are recorded as a reduction to the note payable liability.
906709_18_ITEM7_P43_S3	On October 5, 2015, we used a portion of the proceeds from these notes to redeem the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 12.0% seni or secured notes due in 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P43_S4	In addition, on October 5, 2015, we paid accrued interest of $3.3 million and made a $12.5 million redemption payment, which includes $1.2 million additional interest paid to the 12% note holders at redemption.
906709_18_ITEM7_P43_S5	We received proceeds from issuance of common stock related to our employee option and stock purchase plans of $59.5 million, $20.3 million, and $32.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in Note 8 of Item 8.
906709_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	These amounts primarily result from our Mission Bay Facility lease, which expires in 2030.
906709_18_ITEM7_P45_S1	The lease is discussed in Note 6 of Item 8.
906709_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Substantially all of this amount was subject to open purchase orders as of December 31, 2017 that were issued under existing contracts.
906709_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	This amount does not represent minimum contract termination liabilities for our existing contracts.
906709_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	We do not utilize off-balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing.
906709_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	The preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources, and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.
906709_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	Actual results may differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
906709_18_ITEM7_P48_S3	We have determined that for the periods in this report, the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and the results of our operations.
906709_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	Revenue Recognition License, collaboration and other research revenue is recognized based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement and includes amortization of upfront fees.
906709_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	We defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed.
906709_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	The amount of upfront fees and other payments received under our license and collaboration agreements that are allocated to our continuing obligations are generally recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each arrangement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	Management makes its best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research and development activities, or manufacturing activities through the completion of clinical development or the termination or expiration of the collaboration agreement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	to determine the duration of the performance period.
906709_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	Our original estimates are periodi cally evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimates to change and if so, amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively.
906709_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	In addition, at the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_18_ITEM7_P51_S3	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_18_ITEM7_P51_S4	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_18_ITEM7_P51_S5	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material changes would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Clinical Trial Accruals We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical study activities performed by third parties.
906709_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients and completion of certain clinical trial activities.
906709_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical studies ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical studies based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the studies.
906709_18_ITEM7_P52_S5	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_18_ITEM7_P54_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_18_ITEM7_P54_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period identified.
906709_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	Stock-Based Compensation We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for each respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of grant (grant date fair value).
906709_18_ITEM7_P55_S1	We expense the estimated fair value of each award ratably over the expected service period of the award and recognize forfeitures as they occur.
906709_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_18_ITEM7_P56_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_18_ITEM7_P56_S2	Because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options.
906709_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	Management continually assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	In addition, for awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate whether the awards will vest and the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to the assumptions and methodologies, and which could materially impact our fair value determination, as well as our stock-based compensation expense.
906709_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	In February 2012, we sold all of our rights to receive future royalty payments from sales of the CIMZIA and MIRCERA drug products marketed by UCB and Roche, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM7_P58_S1	Although we are required to make payments to the purchaser (RPI) only in certain situations, including the event of our breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in the Purchase and Sale Agreement that gives rise to a liability in accordance with the terms and conditions of such agreement, this royalty sale transaction was recorded as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that we will amortize using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P58_S2	As a result, we impute interest on the transaction and record interest expense at the estimated interest rate.
906709_18_ITEM7_P58_S3	Our estimate of the interest rate under the agreement is based on the amount of royalty payments to be received by RPI over the life of the arrangement and payments we are required to make to RPI under the agreement.
906709_18_ITEM7_P58_S4	We will periodically assess the expected royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche using a combination of historical results and forecasts from market data sources.
906709_18_ITEM7_P58_S5	To the extent such payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCER A are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_18_ITEM7_P60_S1	Conversely, if sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are higher than expected, non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_18_ITEM7_P60_S2	During the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as a result of increases in the forecasted sales of CIMZIA , our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement increased from 17% to approximately 17.6%, which results in a prospective interest rate of 21%.
906709_18_ITEM7_P60_S3	If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2017 should have been one percentage point higher than our quarterly estimates during 2017, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Royalty Obligation balance as of December 31, 2017 would have increased by $1.1 million.
906709_18_ITEM7_P60_S4	If we had determined that the interest rate used in 2017 should have been 21% during 2017, the non-cash interest expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Royalty Obligation balan ce as of December 31, 2017 would have increased by $3.5 million.
906709_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , and is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	The FASB has issued numerous updates that provide clarification on a number of specific issues as well as requiring additional disclosures.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S2	The new guidance requires the application of a five-step model to determine the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized and requires that we recognize revenue in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of our goods or services to customers in return for expected consideration.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S3	To achieve this core principle, the guidance provides the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S4	Under ASC 606, companies may need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under ASC 605 in the application of this five-step process.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S5	We are continuing to assess the impact of the new guidance on our accounting policies and procedures and are evaluating the new requirements as applied to existing collaboration agreements, both in terms of the cumulative adjustment to opening accumulated deficit and our subsequent recognition of revenue.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S6	Since each collaboration agreement is unique, we will separately assess each agreement (see Note 10 for a discussion of our existing collaboration agreements) under the new standard.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S7	We anticipate that the adoption of ASC 606 will have the following impact to our revenue recognition for a collaboration agreement: (i) Changes in revenue recognition for distinct licenses of functional intellectual property may result in a timing difference of revenue recognition between the current literature and ASC 606.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S8	For certain of our arrangements, the value associated with the licenses and certain other deliverables have been assessed as one unit of accounting and recognized over a period of time in which services are rendered or made available to our customer pursuant to revenue recognition guidance in effect for such arrangements at the time such arrangements commenced.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S9	For certain other arrangements, under current ASC 605 guidance, we identified the value of the license as a separate unit of accounting and recognize revenue upon issuance of the license.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S10	Under ASC 606, we may continue to recognize revenue for such licenses upon delivery of the license.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S11	For other consideration, including milestone payments or contingent payments from our collaboration partners, under our current accounting policy, we recognize such payments as revenue in the period that the payment-triggering event occurred or is achieved.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S12	The new revenue standard, however, may require us to recognize these payments before the payment-triggering event is completely achieved, subject to management s assessment of whether it is probable that the triggering event will be achieved and that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S13	(iii) We will recognize revenue for sales-based royalties and commercial sales-based milestones in the period of the related sale based on estimates, rather than recording them as reported by the customer.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S14	We currently estimate that, upon adoption on January 1, 2018, we will record an adjustment to decrease our accumulated deficit by approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million for amounts that would be recognized as of December 31, 2017 under ASC 606, but are not recognized under the current ASC 605 guidance.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S15	This estimated adjustment primarily consists of approximately $11.0 million for the accrual of royalties due to us related to net sales in the three months ended December 31, 2017 that we would have recognized in 2018 under current guidance.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S16	The estimated adjustment also includes up to approximately $2.0 million related to the recognition of the unamortized portion of upfront payments under ASC 606 that are required to be deferred as of December 31, 2017 under current guidance.
906709_18_ITEM7_P62_S17	We will finalize our assessments in the first quarter of 2018 as we adopt ASC 606.
906709_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance to amend a number of aspects of lease accounting, including requiring lessees to recognize almo st all leases with a term greater than one year as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability, measured at the present value of the lease payments.
906709_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The guidance will become effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
906709_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest Rate and Market Risk The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To achieve this objective, we invest in liquid, high quality debt securities.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	To minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates, we invest in short-term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1.1 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S5	This potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S6	The same hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate $0.8 million decrease, less than 1%, in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2016.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S7	As of December 31, 2017, we held $347.3 million of available-for-sale investments, excluding money market funds, with an average time to maturity of eight months.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S8	To date we have not experienced any liquidity issues with respect to these securities, but should such issues arise, we may be required to hold some, or all, of these securities until maturity.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S9	We believe that, even allowing for potential liquidity issues with respect to these securities, our remaining cash, cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S10	Based on our available cash and our expected operating cash requirements, we currently do not intend to sell these securities prior to maturity and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before we recover the amortized cost basis.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P0_S11	Accordingly, we believe there are no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities and have not recorded any provisions for impairment.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	Foreign Currency Risk The majority of our revenue, expense, and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	However, since a portion of our operations consists of research and development activities outside the United States, we have entered into transactions in other currencies, primarily the Indian Rupee, and we therefore are subject to foreign exchange risk.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility.
906709_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	We do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our exchange rate risks.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Nektar Therapeutics Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nektar Therapeutics (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S1	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S2	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S3	Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S6	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S9	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S10	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estim ates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S11	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_18_ITEM8_P0_S12	We have served as the Company s auditor since 1993.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited Nektar Therapeutics internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	In our opinion, Nektar Therapeutics (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S2	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and our report dated March 1, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S3	Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S4	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S5	We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S6	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S7	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S8	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and pe rforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
906709_18_ITEM8_P1_S9	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
906709_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
906709_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization We are a research-based biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Francisco, California and incorporated in Delaware.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S1	We are developing a pipeline of drug candidates that utilize our advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms, which are designed to enable the development of new molecular entities that target known mechanisms of action.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S2	Our research and development pipeline of new investigational drugs includes treatments for cancer, autoimmune disease and chronic pain.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S3	Our research and development activities have required significant ongoing investment to date and are expected to continue to require significant investment.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S4	As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S5	We have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from licensing, collaboration and manufacturing agreements and financing transactions.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S6	At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $353.2 million in cash and investments in marketable securities and had debt of $250.0 million in principal of senior secured notes due in October 2020.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S7	Our consolidated financial statements include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of our wholly-owned subsidiaries: Nektar Therapeutics (India) Private Limited and Nektar Therapeutics UK Limited.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S8	All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S9	Our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S10	Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S11	Translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S12	To date, such cumulative translation adjustments have not been significant to our consolidated financial position.
906709_18_ITEM8_P8_S13	Aggregate gross foreign currency transaction gains (losses) recorded in operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were not significant.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	Accounting estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	Actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S3	Our estimates include those related to estimated selling prices of deliverables in collaboration agreements, estimated periods of performance, the net realizable value of inventory, the impairment of investments, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, contingencies, accrued clinical trial expenses, estimated non-cash royalty revenue and non-cash interest expense from our liability related to our sale of future royalties, stock-based compensation, and ongoing litigation, among other estimates.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S4	We base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S5	These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily apparent from other sources.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S6	As appropriate, estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information and any changes in estimates will generally be reflected in the period first identified.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S7	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance related to the classification of deferred tax assets described below.
906709_18_ITEM8_P9_S8	Such reclassifications do not materially impact previously reported revenue, operating loss, net loss, total assets, liabilities or stockholders equity.
906709_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	We consider all investments in marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
906709_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	Investments in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year, or where our intent is to use the investments to fund current operations or to make them available for current operations, are classified as short-term investments.
906709_18_ITEM8_P10_S2	Investments in securities with remaining maturities of over one year are classified as long-term investments.
906709_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	Investments are des ignated as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
906709_18_ITEM8_P11_S1	The disclosed fair value related to our cash equivalents and investments is bas ed on market prices from a variety of industry standard data providers and generally represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data.
906709_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale, as well as amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, are included in interest income.
906709_18_ITEM8_P12_S1	Realized gains and losses and declines in value of available-for-sale securities judged to be other-than-temporary, if any, are included in other income (expense).
906709_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
906709_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments are exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the third parties that hold or issue such assets.
906709_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments are held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality.
906709_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	Our investment policy limits investments to fixed income securities denominated and payable in U.S. dollars such as U.S. government obligations, money market instruments and funds, and corporate bonds and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer.
906709_18_ITEM8_P14_S3	Accounts Receivable and Significant Customer Concentrations Our customers are primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are located in the U.S. and Europe and with whom we have multi-year arrangements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P14_S4	Our accounts receivable balance contains billed and unbilled trade receivables from product sales, milestones, other contingent payments and royalties, as well as time and materials based billings from collaborative research and development agreements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	When appropriate, we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving for specifically identified doubtful accounts.
906709_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	We generally do not require collateral from our customers.
906709_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	We perform a regular review of our customers credit risk and payment histories, including payments made subsequent to year-end.
906709_18_ITEM8_P15_S3	We have not experienced significant credit losses from our accounts receivable.
906709_18_ITEM8_P15_S4	At December 31, 2017, four different customers represented 43%, 20%, 19% and 14%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_18_ITEM8_P15_S5	At December 31, 2016, three different customers represented 39%, 32%, and 13%, respectively, of our accounts receivable.
906709_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Inventory and Significant Supplier Concentrations Inventory is generally manufactured upon receipt of firm purchase orders from our collaboration partners.
906709_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	Inventory includes direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead and cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
906709_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and defective or excess inventory is written down to net realizable value based on historical experience or projected usage.
906709_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	Inventory related to our research and development activities is expensed when purchased.
906709_18_ITEM8_P16_S4	We are dependent on our suppliers and contract manufacturers to provide raw materials, drugs and devices of appropriate quality and reliability and to meet applicable contract and regulatory requirements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P16_S5	In certain cases, we rely on single sources of supply of one or more critical materials.
906709_18_ITEM8_P16_S6	Consequently, in the event that supplies are delayed or interrupted for any reason, our ability to develop and produce our drug candidates or our ability to meet our supply obligations could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Long-Lived Assets Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.
906709_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	Major improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred.
906709_18_ITEM8_P17_S2	Manufacturing, laboratory and other equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over estimated useful lives of three to ten years.
906709_18_ITEM8_P17_S3	Buildings are depreciated using the straight-line method generally over the estimated useful life of twenty years.
906709_18_ITEM8_P17_S4	Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
906709_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for another entity over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
906709_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	We are organized in one reporting unit and evaluate the goodwill for the Company as a whole.
906709_18_ITEM8_P18_S2	Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year using an October 1 measurement date.
906709_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
906709_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	When such events occur, we determine whether there has been an impairment in value by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value, as measured by the anticipated undiscounted net cash flows associated with the asset.
906709_18_ITEM8_P19_S2	In the case of goodwill impairment, market capitalization is generally used as the measure of fair value.
906709_18_ITEM8_P19_S3	If an impairment in value exists, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.
906709_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	Our revenue is derived from our arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology collaboration partners and may result from one or more of the following: upfront and license fees, payments for contract research and development, milestone and other contingent payments, manufacturing and supply payments, and royalties.
906709_18_ITEM8_P20_S1	Our performance obligations under our collaborations may include licensing our intellectual property, manufacturing and supply obligations, and research and development obligations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	In order to account for the multiple-element arrangements, we identify the deliverables included within the arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting.
906709_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	Analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment, and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver goods or services, a right or license to use an asset, or another performance obligation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	Revenue is recognized separately for each identified unit of accounting when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met: there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	At the inception of each new multiple-element arrangement or the material modification of an existing multiple-element arrangement, we allocate all consideration received under multiple-element arrangements to all units of accounting based on the relative selling price method, generally based on our best estimate of selling price (ESP).
906709_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a stand-alone basis.
906709_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	We determine ESP for the elements in our collaboration arrangements by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, technical complexity of the performance obligation and similarity of elements to those performed under previous arrangements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P22_S3	Since we apply significant judgment in arriving at the ESPs, any material change in our estimates would significantly affect the allocation of the total consideration to the different elements of a multiple element arrangement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	Product sales Product sales are primarily derived from fixed price manufacturing and supply agreements with our collaboration partners.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Our products are tested for adherence to technical specifications prior to shipment, accordingly, we have not experienced any significant returns from our customers.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	Generally, we are entitled to royalties from our collaboration partners based on the net sales of their approved drugs that are marketed and sold in one or more countries where we hold royalty rights.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S3	We recognize royalty revenue when the cash is received or when the royalty amount to be received is estimable and collection is reasonably assured.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S4	With respect to the non-cash royalties related to our sale of future royalties described in Note 7, revenue is recognized when estimable, otherwise, revenue is recognized during the period in which the related royalty report is received, which generally occurs in the quarter after the applicable product sales are made.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S5	The amount of upfront fees and other payments received by us in license and collaboration arrangements that are allocated to continuing performance obligations, such as manufacturing and supply obligations, is deferred and generally recognized ratably over our expected performance period under each respective arrangement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S6	We make our best estimate of the period over which we expect to fulfill our performance obligations, which may include technology transfer assistance, research activities, clinical development activities, and manufacturing activities from research and development through the commercialization of the product.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S7	Given the uncertainties of these collaboration arrangements, significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the performance period and this estimate is periodically re-evaluated.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S8	Upon the termination of each of our license and collaboration arrangements and if no additional services are required to be performed by us, all non-refundable, non-creditable amounts previously deferred from the arrangement are recognized as revenue.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S9	Contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved, which we believe is consistent with the substance of our performance under our various license and collaboration agreements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S10	A milestone is defined as an event (i) that can only be achieved based in whole or in part either on the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance, (ii) for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved, and (iii) that would result in additional payments being due to the entity.
906709_18_ITEM8_P23_S11	A milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent with our performance required to achieve the milestone or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance, relates solely to our past performance, and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Our license and collaboratio n agreements with our partners provide for payments to us upon the achievement of development milestones, such as the completion of clinical trials or regulatory submissions, approvals by regulatory authorities, and commercial launches of drugs.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Given the challenges inherent in developing and obtaining regulatory approval for drug products and in achieving commercial launches, there was substantial uncertainty whether any such milestones would be achieved at the time of execution of these licensing and coll aboration agreements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	In addition, we evaluated whether the development milestones met the remaining criteria to be considered substantive.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S3	As a result of our analysis, we consider our remaining development milestones under all of our license and collabora tion agreements to be substantive and, accordingly, we recognize as revenue payments received from each milestone only if and as such milestone is achieved.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S4	Our license and collaboration agreements with certain partners also provide for contingent payments to us based solely upon the performance of the respective partner.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S5	For such contingent amounts, we recognize the payments as revenue when earned under the applicable contract, which is generally upon completion of performance by the respective partner, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S6	Our license and collaboration agreements with our partners also provide for payments to us upon the achievement of specified sales volumes of approved drugs.
906709_18_ITEM8_P24_S7	We consider these payments to be similar to royalty payments and we recognize such sales-based payments upon achievement of such sales volumes, provided that collection is reasonably assured.
906709_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Shipping and Handling Costs We recognize costs related to shipping and handling of product to customers in cost of goods sold.
906709_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Research and Development Expense Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries, benefits and other operating costs such as outside services, supplies and allocated overhead costs.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	We perform research and development for our proprietary drug candidates and technology development and for certain third parties under collaboration agreements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	For our proprietary drug candidates and our internal technology development programs, we invest our own funds without reimbursement from a third party.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	Where we perform research and development activities under a clinical joint development collaboration, such as our collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb, we record the cost reimbursement from our partner as a reduction to research and development expense when reimbursement amounts are due to us under the agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S3	We record accruals for the estimated costs of our clinical trial activities performed by third parties.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S4	The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows to our vendors.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S5	Payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, successful enrollment of patients, and completion of certain clinical trial activities.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S6	We generally accrue costs associated with the start-up and reporting phases of the clinical trials ratably over the estimated duration of the start-up and reporting phases.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S7	We generally accrue costs associated with the treatment phase of clinical trials based on the total estimated cost of the treatment phase on a per patient basis and we expense the per patient cost ratably over the estimated patient treatment period based on patient enrollment in the trials.
906709_18_ITEM8_P26_S8	In specific circumstances, such as for certain time-based costs, we recognize clinical trial expenses using a methodology that we consider to be more reflective of the timing of costs incurred.
906709_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	Advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized as prepaid expenses and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.
906709_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	We base our estimates on the best information available at the time.
906709_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	However, additional information may become available to us which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods.
906709_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	In this event, we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain.
906709_18_ITEM8_P28_S3	Such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period identified.
906709_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation arrangements include stock option grants and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), through which employees may purchase our common stock at a discount to the market price.
906709_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of the option on the date of grant (grant date fair value) and the estimated fair value of common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.
906709_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	These variables include, but are not limited to, our stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.
906709_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options or common stock purchased under the ESPP.
906709_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The fair value of an RSU is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the grant date.
906709_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	Management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P31_S3	Circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies, and whi ch could materially impact our fair value determination.
906709_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	We expense the value of the portion of the option or award on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and recognize forfeitures of options and awards as they occur.
906709_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	For options and awards that vest upon the achievement of performance milestones, we estimate the vesting period based on our evaluation of the probability of achievement of each respective milestone and the related estimated date of achievement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Stock-based compensation expense for purchases under the ESPP is recognized over the respective six-month purchase period.
906709_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Expense amounts are recorded in cost of goods sold, research and development expense, and general and administrative expense based on the function of the applicable employee.
906709_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Stock-based compensation charges are non-cash charges and as such have no impact on our reported cash flows.
906709_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Basic net loss per share is calculated based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.
906709_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	For all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, basic and diluted net loss per share are the same due to our net losses and the requirement to exclude potentially dilutive securities which would have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per share.
906709_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	During 2017, 2016 and 2015, potentially dilutive securities consisted of common shares underlying outstanding stock options and RSUs.
906709_18_ITEM8_P36_S3	There were weighted average outstanding stock options and RSUs of 20.6 million, 19.9 million and 21.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the liability method.
906709_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
906709_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	We record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce their carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
906709_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets, our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.
906709_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	We utilize a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions.
906709_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.
906709_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	Comprehensive loss Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders equity from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.
906709_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	Our other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net loss, gains and losses from the foreign currency translation of the assets and liabilities of our India and UK subsidiaries, and unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities.
906709_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify several aspects of employee share-based payment accounting, including forfeitures, income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
906709_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	This guidance was effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	As a result of the adoption of this guidance, as of January 1, 2017, we recorded a $0.2 million charge to our accumulated deficit in our Consolidated Balance Sheet related to our election to recognize forfeitures of awards as they occur.
906709_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	In addition, prior to adoption of this guidance, tax attributes related to stock option windfall deductions were not recorded until they resulted in a reduction of cash tax payable.
906709_18_ITEM8_P41_S4	As of December 31, 2016, the excluded windfall deductions for federal and state purposes were $20.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Upon adoption, we recognized the excluded windfall deductions as a deferred tax asset on a tax-effected basis with a corresponding increase in the valuation allowance.
906709_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	In November 2015, the FASB issued guidance to require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet.
906709_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Accordingly, as of January 1, 2017, we reclassified $0.3 million from other current assets to our other assets balance.
906709_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	This reclassification was applied retrospectively to these balances in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016.
906709_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which supersedes the guidance in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition , and is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The FASB has issued numerous updates that provide clarification on a number of specific issues as well as requiring additional disclosures.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	We plan to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S2	The new guidance requires the application of a five-step model to determine the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized and requires that we recognize revenue in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of our goods or services to customers in return for expected consideration.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S3	To achieve this core principle, the guidance provides the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S4	Under ASC 606, companies may need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under ASC 605 in the application of this five-step process.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S5	We are continuing to assess the impact of the new guidance on our accounting policies and procedures and are evaluating the new requirements as applied to existing collaboration agreements, both in terms of the cumulative adjustment to opening accumulated deficit and our subsequent recognition of revenue.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S6	Since each collaboration agreement is unique, we will separately assess each agreement (see Note 10 for a discussion of our existing collaboration agreements) under the new standard.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S7	We anticipate that the adoption of ASC 606 will have the following impact to our revenue recognition for a collaboration agreement: (i) Changes in revenue recognition for distinct licenses of functional intellectual property may result in a timing difference of revenue recognition between the current literature and ASC 606.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S8	For certain of our arrangements, the value associated with the licenses and certain other deliverables have been assessed as one unit of accounting and recognized over a period of time in which services are rendered or made available to our customer pursuant to revenue recognition guidance in effect for such arrangements at the time such arrangements commenced.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S9	For certain other arrangements, under current ASC 605 guidance, we identified the value of the license as a separate unit of accounting and recognize revenue upon issuance of the license.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S10	Under ASC 606, we may continue to recognize revenue for such licenses upon delivery of the license.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S11	For other consideration, including milestone payments or contingent payments from our collaboration partners, under our current accounting policy, we recognize such payments as revenue in the period that the payment-triggering event occurred or is achieved.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S12	The new revenue standard, however, may require us to recognize these payments before the payment-triggering event is completely achieved, subject to management s assessment of whether it is probable that the triggering event will be achieved and that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S13	(iii) We will recognize revenue for sales-based royalties and commercial sales-based milestones in the period of the related sale based on estimates, rather than recording them as reported by the customer.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S14	We currently estimate that, upon adoption on January 1, 2018, we will record an adjustment to decrease our accumulated deficit by approximately $11.0 million to $13.0 million for amounts that would be recognized as of December 31, 2017 under ASC 606, but are not recognized under the current ASC 605 guidance.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S15	This estimated adjustment primarily consists of approximately $11.0 million for the accrual of royalties due to us related to net sales in the three months ended December 31, 2017 that we would have recognized in 2018 under current guidance.
906709_18_ITEM8_P45_S16	The estimated adjustment also includes up to approximately $2.0 million related to the recognition of the unamortized portion of upfront payment amounts under ASC 606 that are required to be deferred as of December 31, 2017 under current guidance.

906709_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Note 7 Liability Related to the Sale of Future Royalties On February 24, 2012, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Purchase and Sale Agreement) with RPI Finance Trust (RPI), an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, pursuant to which we sold, and RPI purchased, our right to receive royalty payments (the Royalty Entitlement) arising from the worldwide net sales, from and after January 1, 2012, of (a) CIMZIA , under our license, manufacturing and supply agreement with UCB Pharma (UCB), and (b) MIRCERA , under our license, manufacturing and supply agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together referred to as Roche).
906709_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	We received aggregate cash proceeds of $124.0 million for the Royalty Entitlement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	As part of this sale, we incurred approximately $4.4 million in transaction costs, which will be amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P64_S3	Although we sold all of our rights to receive royalties from the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, as a result of our ongoing manufacturing and supply obligations related to the generation of these royalties, we will continue to account for these royalties as revenue, and we recorded the $124.0 million in proceeds from this transaction as a liability (Royalty Obligation) that will be amortized using the interest method over the estimated life of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P64_S4	The following table shows the activity within the liability account during the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from the inception of the royalty transaction on February 24, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2017 (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, in March 2014 and March 2013, we were required to pay RPI $7.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, as a result of worldwide net sales of MIRCERA for the 12 month periods ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 not reaching certain minimum thresholds.
906709_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	The Purchase and Sale Agreement does not include any other potential payments related to minimum net sales thresholds and, therefore, we do not expect to make any further payments to RPI related to this agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized $30.5 million, $30.2 million, and $22.1 million, respectively, in non-cash royalties from net sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA , and we recorded $18.9 million, $19.7 million and $20.6 million, respectively, of related non-cash interest expense.
906709_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	As royalties are remitted to RPI from Roche and UCB, the balance of the Royalty Obligation will be effectively repaid over the life of the agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	In order to determine the amortization of the Royalty Obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by RPI.
906709_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	The sum of these amounts less the $124.0 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	From inception until 2017, our estimate of this total interest expense resulted in an effective annual interest rate of approximately 17%.
906709_18_ITEM8_P67_S3	We periodically assess the estimated royalty payments to RPI from UCB and Roche and to the extent the amount or timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P67_S4	During the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as a result of increases in the forecasted sales of CIMZIA , our estimate of the effective annual interest rate over the life of the agreement increased to 17.6%, which results in a prospective interest rate of 21%.
906709_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , most of which are not within our control.
906709_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	Such factors include, but are not limited to, changing standards of care, the introduction of competing products, manufacturing or other delays, biosimilar competition, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of the drug products, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalties remitted to RPI are made in U.S. dollars (USD) while significant portions of the underlying sales of CIMZIA and MIRCERA are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from CIMZIA and MIRCERA , all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	expected, the non-cash royalty revenues and the non-cash interest expense recorded by us would be greater over the term of the Royalty Obligation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	In addition, the Purchase and Sale Agreement grants RPI the right to receive certain reports and other information relating to the Royalty Entitlement and contains other representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification obligations that are customary for a transaction of this nature.
906709_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	To our knowledge, we are currently in compliance with these provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement; however, if we were to breach our obligations, we could be required to pay damages to RPI that are not limited to the purchase price we received in the sale transaction.
906709_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	In the normal course of business, we enter into various firm purchase commitments related to contract manufacturing, clinical development and certain other items.
906709_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	As of December 31, 2017, these commitments were approximately $16.5 million, all of which are expected to be paid in 2018.
906709_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	Legal Matters From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, arbitrations, claims, investigations and proceedings, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
906709_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	We make provisions for liabilities when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
906709_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	Such provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impact of settlement negotiations, judicial and administrative rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
906709_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	If any unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of our operations of that period and on our cash flows and liquidity.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	On August 14, 2015, Enzon, Inc. filed a breach of contract complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Court) claiming damages of $1.5 million (plus interest) for unpaid licensing fees (the Enzon Litigation ) through the date of the complaint.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	Enzon alleged that we failed to pay a post-patent expiration immunity fee related to one of the licenses.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	On June 26, 2017, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Cross-License and Option Agreement (Cross-License Agreement) with Enzon in which we agreed to pay Enzon a sum of $7.0 million to satisfy all past and future obligations of royalty payments pursuant to the Cross-License Agreement and to have the Enzon Litigation dismissed.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S3	The Enzon Litigation was dismissed with prejudice on June 30, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S4	We paid $3.5 million in June 2017 and the remaining $3.5 million in December 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S5	Of the total $7.0 million consideration, $1.4 million represents our accrued royalty liability to Enzon related to commercial sales of certain products from January 2017 through June 2017 recorded in cost of goods sold for year ended December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S6	In addition, $2.3 million was recorded as a prepaid royalty asset for estimated future commercial sales of certain products through the term of the applicable underlying Enzon patents expiring in March 2018, which Nektar will amortize over this period.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S7	As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized prepaid royalty balance is $0.6 million and is included in other current assets.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S8	We recorded the remaining $3.3 million of consideration in general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2017 .
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S9	No liability was recorded for this matter on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S10	After the termination of our royalty obligations under the Enzon agreement discussed above, we will have no third party licenses that require us to pay royalties based on our sales of certain products and/or on our recognition of royalty revenue under certain of our collaboration agreements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P74_S11	Royalty expense, which is reflected in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, was approximately $3.1 million, $3.7 million, and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	Foreign Operations We operate in a number of foreign countries.
906709_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	As a result, we are subject to numerous local laws and regulations that can result in claims made by foreign government agencies or other third parties that are often difficult to predict even after the application of good faith compliance efforts.
906709_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	During the course of our normal operating activities, we have agreed to certain contingent indemnification obligations as further described below.
906709_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	The term of our indemnification obligations is generally perpetual.
906709_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	There is generally no limitation on the potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	significant costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims based on our indemnification obligations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	If any of our indemnification obligations is triggered, we may incur substantial liabilities.
906709_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	Because the aggregate amount of any potential indemnification obligation is not a stat ed amount, the overall maximum amount of any such obligations cannot be reasonably estimated.
906709_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	No liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.
906709_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	Indemnifications in Connection with Commercial Agreements As part of our collaboration agreements with our partners related to the license, development, manufacture and supply of drugs based on our proprietary technologies and drug candidates, we generally agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our partners from and against third party liabilities arising out of the agreement, including product liability (with respect to our activities) and infringement of intellectual property to the extent the intellectual property is developed by us and licensed to our partners.
906709_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	As part of the sale of our royalty interest in the CIMZIA and MIRCERA products, we and RPI made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by indemnity obligations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	Additionally, as part of our pulmonary asset sale to Novartis in 2008, we and Novartis made representations and warranties and entered into certain covenants and ancillary agreements which are supported by an indemnity obligation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	In the event it is determined that we breached certain of the representations and warranties or covenants and agreements made by us in any such agreements, we could incur substantial indemnification liabilities depending on the timing, nature, and amount of any such claims.
906709_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Indemnification of Underwriters and Initial Purchasers of our Securities In connection with our sale of equity and senior secured debt securities, we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our underwriters or initial purchasers, as applicable, as well as certain related parties from and against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
906709_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	Director and Officer Indemnifications As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, we indemnify our directors, executive officers, other officers, employees, and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity.
906709_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, we have insurance policies that may limit our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.
906709_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, we believe any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1.8 million per incident for merger and acquisition related claims, $1.8 million per incident for securities related claims and $0.5 million per incident for non-securities related claims retention deductible per our insurance policy.
906709_18_ITEM8_P80_S4	However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case we may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	We have authorized 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock with each share having a par value of $0.0001.

906709_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	Subject to the terms of the 2017 Plan, 8,300,000 shares of our common stock, reduced by the number of shares of common stock subject to awards granted under the 2012 Plan on or after March 31, 2017 and prior to the adoption of the 2017 Plan, were initially available for awards under the 2017 Plan.
906709_18_ITEM8_P85_S3	Shares issued in respect of any full-value award granted under the 2017 Plan will be counted against the share limit described in the preceding sentence as 1.5 shares for every one share actually issued in connection with the award.
906709_18_ITEM8_P85_S4	Shares that are subject to or underlie awards which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the 2017 Plan or any Prior Plan (as defined below) will again be available for subsequent awards under the 2017 Plan (with any such shares subject to full-value awards increasing the 2017 Plan s share limit based on the full-value award ratio described above or, in the case of an award granted under a Prior Plan, the full-value award ratio set forth in such Prior Plan).
906709_18_ITEM8_P85_S5	Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company to pay the exercise price of an award granted under the 2017 Plan, as well as any shares exchanged or withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award, will not be available for subsequent awards under the 2017 Plan.
906709_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	The purpose of the 2017 Plan and our other incentive plans is to promote the success of the Company by providing an additional means for us to attract, motivate, retain and reward directors, officers, employees, and other eligible persons through the grant of awards.
906709_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	Equity-based awards are also intended to further align the interests of award recipients and our stockholders.
906709_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	The 2017 Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock or similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, and other forms of awards granted or denominated in our common stock or units of the Company s common stock, as well as cash bonus awards.
906709_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	Members of the Board of Directors, officers or employees, certain consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive awards under the 2017 Plan.
906709_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Pursuant to the 2017 Plan, we granted or issued non-qualified stock options and RSUs to employees, officers, and non-employee directors during 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	The requisite service period for stock options granted to our employees under the 2017 Plan as well as our Prior Plans is generally four years; the requisite service period for stock options granted to our directors is generally one year.
906709_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	The requisite service period for RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan and our Prior Plans is generally three years for employees and one year for directors.
906709_18_ITEM8_P88_S3	The 2017 Plan will terminate on March 27, 2027, unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors.
906709_18_ITEM8_P88_S4	The maximum term of a stock option or stock appreciation right under the 2017 Plan and our Prior Plans is eight years from the date of grant.
906709_18_ITEM8_P88_S5	The per share exercise price of an option generally may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Company s common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market on the date of grant.
906709_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	In addition to the 2017 Plan, we have other equity incentive plans under which options and restricted stock units granted remain outstanding but no new options or restricted stock units may be granted either as a result of the effectiveness of the 2017 Plan or the expiration of such other plan.
906709_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	These other equity incentive plans include: (i) the 2012 Plan which was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 4, 2012 and approved by our stockholders on June 28, 2012, amended on June 16, 2015 by approval of our stockholders to make available for award grants 7,000,000 additional shares, and replaced by the 2017 Plan; (ii) the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (2008 Plan) which was adopted by the Board of Directors on March 20, 2008 and approved by our stockholders on June 6, 2008; (iii) the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (2000 Plan) which was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 19, 2000 by amending and restating our 1994 Equity Incentive Plan, and which expired on February 9, 2010; and (iv) the 1998 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan which was adopted by our Board of Directors on August 18, 1998, and amended and restated in its entirety and renamed the 2000 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan on June 6, 2000 (2000 Non-Officer Plan and collectively with the 2012 Plan, the 2008 Plan and the 2000 Plan, the Prior Plans).

906709_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	Pursuant to the 2000 Non-Officer Plan, we previously granted or issued non-qualified stock options, rights to acquire restricted stock and stock bonuses to employees and consultants who are neither officers nor directors of Nektar.
906709_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	In February 1994, our Board of Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) pursuant to section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
906709_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Under the ESPP, 2,500,000 shares of our common stock have been authorized for issuance.
906709_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	The terms of the ESPP provide eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in Nektar through participation in a program of periodic payroll deductions for the purchase of our common stock.
906709_18_ITEM8_P91_S3	Employees may elect to enroll or re-enroll in the ESPP on a semi-annual basis.
906709_18_ITEM8_P91_S4	Stock is purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price on the first day of the enrollment period or the last day of the enrollment period.

906709_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	The 401(k) plan permits us to make matching contributions on behalf of all participants, up to a maximum of $4,000 per participant.
906709_18_ITEM8_P92_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recognized $1.6 million, $1.1 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, of compensation expense in connection with our 401(k) retirement plan.
906709_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	Change in Control Severance Plan On December 6, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a Change of Control Severance Benefit Plan (CIC Plan).
906709_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	This CIC Plan has subsequently been amended a number of times by our Board of Directors with the most recent amendment occurring on April 5, 2011.
906709_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	The CIC Plan is designed to make certain benefits available to our eligible employees in the event of a change of control of Nektar and, following such change of control, an employee s employment with us or a successor company is terminated in certain specified circumstances.
906709_18_ITEM8_P93_S3	We adopted the CIC Plan to support the continuity of the business in the context of a change of control transaction.
906709_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The CIC Plan was not adopted in contemplation of any specific change of control transaction.
906709_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	Under the CIC Plan, in the event of a change of control of Nektar and a subsequent termination of employment initiated by us or a successor company other than for Cause (as defined in the CIC Plan) or initiated by the employee for a Good Reason Resignation (as defined in the CIC Plan) in each case within twelve months following a change of control transaction, (i) the Chief Executive Officer would be entitled to receive cash severance pay equal to 24 months base salary plus annual target incentive pay, the extension of employee benefits over this severance period and the full acceleration of unvested outstanding equity awards, and (ii) our Senior Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents (including Principal Fellows) would each be entitled to receive cash severance pay equal to twelve months base salary plus annual target incentive pay, the extension of employee benefits over this severance period and the full acceleration of unvested outstanding equity awards.

906709_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	Note 10 License and Collaboration Agreements We have entered into various collaboration agreements including license agreements and collaborative research, development and commercialization agreements with various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
906709_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	Under these collaboration arrangements, we are entitled to receive license fees, upfront payments, milestone and other contingent payments, royalties, sales milestone payments, and payments for the manufacture and supply of our proprietary PEGylation materials and/or for research and development activities.
906709_18_ITEM8_P95_S2	All of our collaboration agreements are generally cancelable by our partners without significant financial penalty.
906709_18_ITEM8_P95_S3	Our costs of performing these services are generally included in research and development expense, except that costs for product sales to our collaboration partners are included in cost of goods sold.
906709_18_ITEM8_P95_S4	In accordance with our collaboration agreements, we recognized license, collaboration and other revenue as follows (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	As of December 31, 2017, our collaboration agreements with partners included potential future payments for development milestones totaling approximately $305.5 million, including amounts from our agreements with Lilly and Baxalta described below.
906709_18_ITEM8_P96_S1	In addition, under our collaboration agreements we are entitled to receive other contingent payments, including contingent sales milestones and royalty payments, as described below.
906709_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly): NKTR-358 Effective August 23, 2017, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) to co-develop NKTR-358, a novel immunological drug candidate that we invented.
906709_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	Under the terms of the agreement we (i) received an initial payment of $150.0 million in September 2017 and are eligible for up to $250.0 million in additional development milestones, (ii) will co-develop NKTR-358 with Lilly with Nektar responsible for completing Phase 1 clinical development and certain drug product development and supply activities, (iii) will share with Lilly Phase 2 development costs with 75% of those costs borne by Lilly and 25% of the costs borne by Nektar, (iv) will have the option to contribute funding to Phase 3 development on an indication-by-indication basis ranging from zero to 25% of development costs, and (v) will have the opportunity to receive up to double-digit sales royalty rates that escalate based upon our Phase 3 development cost contribution and the level of annual global product sales.
906709_18_ITEM8_P97_S2	Lilly will be responsible for all costs of global commercialization, and we will have an option to co-promote in the U.S. under certain conditions.
906709_18_ITEM8_P97_S3	A portion of the development milestones may be reduced by 50% under certain conditions, related to the final formulation of the approved product and the timing of prior approval (if any) of competitive products with a similar mechanism of action, which could reduce these milestone payments by 75% if both conditions occur.
906709_18_ITEM8_P97_S4	The agreement will continue until Lilly no longer has any royalty payment obligations to us or, if earlier, the termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms.
906709_18_ITEM8_P97_S5	The agreement may be terminated by Lilly for convenience, and may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including material breach.
906709_18_ITEM8_P97_S6	We identified our license grant to Lilly, our ongoing Phase 1 clinical development obligation, our drug product development obligation and our obligation to supply clinical trial materials as the significant, non-contingent deliverables under the agreement and concluded that each of these deliverables represents a separate unit of accounting.
906709_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	The valuation of each unit of accounting involves significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to, expected market opportunity and pricing, assumed royalty rates, clinical trial costs, timelines and likelihood of success; in each case these estimates and assumptions covering long time periods.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	We determined the best estimate of the selling price for the license based on a discounted cash flow analysis of projected revenues from NKTR-358 and development and commercial costs using a discount rate based on a market participant s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for forecasting risk.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	We determined the best estimate of selling prices for Phase 1 clinical development, drug product development and clinical supply deliverables based on the nature of the services to be performed and estimates of the associated efforts and third-party rates for similar services.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	Based on these estimates at agreement inception, the $150.0 million upfront payment was allocated $125.9 million to the license, $17.6 million to the Phase 1 clinical development and $6.5 million to the drug product development based on our estimate of their relative selling prices.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S3	We did not allocate any of the upfront arrangement consideration to the clinical trial material supply obligations as we will receive incremental consideration when we deliver such materials.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S4	We recognized license revenue upon the effective date of the arrangement in August 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S5	We will recognize revenue related to Phase 1 clinical development and drug product development activities using the proportionate performance method as services are provided over the estimated service period, which we estimate will continue until the end of 2019.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S6	As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $125.9 million of revenue related to the license and $4.2 million of revenue related to Phase 1 clinical development and drug product development activities.
906709_18_ITEM8_P99_S7	We recorded the remaining $19.9 million related to Phase 1 clinical development and drug product development activities as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	Ophthotech Corporation : Fovista On October 27, 2017, we terminated our license and supply agreement with Ophthotech Corporation (Ophthotech) dated September 2006, pursuant to which Ophthotech received a worldwide, exclusive license to certain of our proprietary PEGylation technology to develop, manufacture and sell Fovista .
906709_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	Under the terms of our agreement, we were the exclusive supplier of all of Ophthotech s clinical and commercial requirements for our proprietary PEGylation reagent used in Fovista .
906709_18_ITEM8_P100_S2	The termination of our agreement with Ophthotech followed Opthotech s previous announcements, in December 2016 and August 2017, that their three pivotal Phase 3 studies investigating the superiority of Fovista therapy in combination with Lucentis therapy compared to Lucentis monotherapy and evaluating Fovista in combination with Eylea or Avastin compared to Eylea or Avastin monotherapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) did not achieve the pre-specified primary endpoints.
906709_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Under our agreement with Ophthotech, in June 2014, we received a $19.8 million payment from Ophthotech in connection with its licensing agreement with Novartis.

906709_18_ITEM8_P102_S3	The termination of this agreement followed Bayer s announcement in November 2017 that the Phase 3 Amikacin Inhale clinical program for the treatment of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia did not meet its primary endpoint or key secondary endpoints.
906709_18_ITEM8_P102_S4	Under this collaboration, we received an upfront payment of $40.0 million (which was paid to us in 2007) and milestone payments totaling $30.0 million (the last of which was paid to us in 2013).
906709_18_ITEM8_P102_S5	As a result of the termination of the agreement, we recognized the remaining $16.8 million of deferred revenue related to this arrangement in the three months ended December 31, 2017.

906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	As a result of the FDA s approval, we earned a $10.0 million development milestone in November 2015.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S2	Under the terms of this agreement, we are also entitled to a $10.0 million development milestone due upon marketing authorization in the EU, which was achieved in January 2018.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S3	In addition, we are entitled to sales milestones upon achievement of annual sales targets and royalties based on annual worldwide net sales of products resulting from this agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S4	In October 2017, we entered into a right to sublicense agreement with Baxalta under which we granted to Baxalta the right to grant a nonexclusive sublicense to certain patents that were previously exclusively licensed to Baxalta under our 2005 agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S5	Under the right to sublicense agreement, Baxalta paid us $12.0 million in November 2017 and agreed to pay us single digit royalty payments based upon net sales of the products covered under the sublicense throughout the term of the agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S6	We determined that this right to sublicense agreement should be considered a material modification of the existing arrangement described above.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S7	We have identified our grant of the right to sublicense and our ongoing obligation to supply PEGylation materials specified in the 2005 agreement as the undelivered units of accounting in the arrangement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S8	We made our best estimates of the selling price of these deliverable and recognized the $11.0 million allocated to the right to sublicense and allocated $1.0 million to our ongoing supply obligation unit of accounting.
906709_18_ITEM8_P106_S9	As of December 31, 2017, we have deferred revenue of approximately $1.0 million related to this agreement, which we expect to recognize through January 2028, the estimated end of our supply obligations under the arrangement.

906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	On December 9, 2014, AstraZeneca announced that MOVENTIG (the naloxegol brand name in the European Union or EU) had been granted Marketing Authorisation by the European Commission (EC) for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).
906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S2	In March 2015, we received and recognized a $100.0 million non-refundable payment resulting from the U.S. commercial launch of MOVANTIK .
906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S3	In March 2015, we agreed to pay AstraZeneca a total of $10.0 million to fund U.S. television advertising in consideration for certain additional commercial information rights.
906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S4	We recorded this $10.0 million obligation as a liability and made the initial $5.0 million payment to AstraZeneca in July 2015 and the remaining $5.0 million payment in July 2016.
906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S5	We determined that this $10.0 million obligation should be recorded as a reduction of revenue, which we recorded in 2015.
906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S6	In August 2015, we received and recognized as revenue an additional $40.0 million non-refundable payment triggered by the first commercial sale of MOVENTIG in Germany.
906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S7	On March 1, 2016, AstraZeneca announced that it had entered into an agreement with ProStrakan Group plc, a subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd. (Kirin), granting Kirin exclusive marketing rights to MOVENTIG in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.
906709_18_ITEM8_P111_S8	Under the terms of AstraZeneca s agreement with Kirin, Kirin made a $70.0 million upfront payment to AstraZeneca and will make additional payments based on achieving market access milestones, tiered net sales royalties, as well as sales milestones.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	royalties and sales milestones from Kirin with AstraZeneca receiving 60% and Nektar receiving 40%.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	This payment sharing arrangement is in lieu of other r oyalties payable by AstraZeneca to us and a portion of the sales milestones as described below.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S2	Our 40% share of royalty payments made by Kirin to AstraZeneca will be financially equivalent to us receiving high single-digit to low double-digit royalties de pendent on the level of Kirin s net sales.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S3	Kirin s MOVENTIG net sales will be included for purposes of achieving the annual global sales milestones payable to us by AstraZeneca and will also be included for purposes of determining the applicable ex-U.S. r oyalty rate, from the tier schedule in our AstraZeneca license agreement, that will be applied to ex-U.S. sales outside of the Kirin territory.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S4	The global sales milestones under our license agreement with AstraZeneca will be reduced in relation to the amou nt of Kirin MOVENTIG net sales that contribute to any given annual sales milestone target.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S5	As a result, in April 2016, we received 40% (or $28.0 million) of the $70.0 million payment received by AstraZeneca from Kirin.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S6	In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized a total of $4.6 million and $33.0 million, respectively, related to our share of such license-related payments made to AstraZeneca.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S7	As of December 31, 2017, we do not have deferred revenue related to our agreement with AstraZeneca .
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S8	(Daiichi) terminated our collaboration and license agreement made effective in May 2016, under which we granted Daiichi exclusive commercialization rights in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and Turkey (collectively, the European Territory) to ONZEALD TM (etirinotecan pegol).
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S9	Daiichi was responsible for all commercialization activities in the European Territory and we were responsible for supplying Daiichi with ONZEALD TM and for funding and conducting a Phase 3 confirmatory trial in patients with advanced breast cancer who have brain metastases, which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S10	Daiichi terminated the agreement after the European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use confirmed in November 2017 that it declined the conditional marketing authorization application for ONZEALD TM in the EU.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S11	Under the terms of the agreement, Daiichi paid us a $20.0 million up-front payment in August 2016, of which $12.5 million was refundable to Daiichi if conditional approval was not achieved and the agreement was terminated.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S12	This $12.5 million contingent termination payment from us to Daiichi was recorded in our liability related to refundable upfront payment balance in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 and was paid to Daiichi in December 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S13	In 2016, we allocated the $7.5 million non-refundable portion of the $20.0 million upfront payment from Daiichi to the license grant and our development service deliverables based on their relative estimated selling prices.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S14	As a result, we recognized $3.7 million of revenue in 2016 from this arrangement, primarily related to the delivery of the license.
906709_18_ITEM8_P112_S15	As a result of the termination of the arrangement, we recognized the remaining $3.2 million of deferred revenue in the three months ended December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	Roche: PEGASYS and MIRCERA In February 2012, we entered into a toll-manufacturing agreement with Roche under which we agreed to manufacture the proprietary PEGylation material used by Roche to produce MIRCERA .
906709_18_ITEM8_P113_S1	Roche entered into the toll-manufacturing agreement with the objective of establishing us as a secondary back-up supply source on a non-exclusive basis.
906709_18_ITEM8_P113_S2	Under the terms of our toll-manufacturing agreement, Roche paid us a total of $27.0 million, including amounts for the delivery of specified quantities of PEGylation materials, all of which were completed as of January 2013.
906709_18_ITEM8_P113_S3	In addition, in 2013, we delivered additional quantities of PEGylation materials used by Roche to produce PEGASYS and MIRCERA for total consideration of $18.6 million.
906709_18_ITEM8_P113_S4	As of December 31, 2016, we no longer had any continuing manufacturing or supply obligations under this MIRCERA agreement and, therefore, we have no deferred revenue related to this agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	In February 1997, we entered into a license, manufacturing and supply agreement with Roche, under which we granted Roche a worldwide, exclusive license to certain intellectual property related to our proprietary PEGylation materials used in the manufacture and commercialization of PEGASYS .
906709_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	Our performance obligations under this PEGASYS agreement ended on December 31, 2015.
906709_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	NKTR-214 On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (Clinical Trial Agreement) with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to which we and BMS collaborated to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials evaluating our IL-2-based CD122-biased agonist, known as NKTR-214, and BMS human monoclonal antibody that binds PD-1, known as Opdivo ( nivolumab) , as a potential combination treatment regimen in five tumor types and eight indications, and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a Combination Therapy Trial).
906709_18_ITEM8_P115_S1	We acted as the sponsor of each Combination Therapy Trial.
906709_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	We recorded cost reimbursement payments to us from BMS as a r eduction to research and development expense and we have recorded a total of $7.8 million of such reimbursements in the year ended December 31, 2017 and since the inception of our collaboration.
906709_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	Each party was otherwise responsible for its own internal cos ts, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combination Therapy Trial.
906709_18_ITEM8_P116_S2	Nektar and BMS used commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture and supply NKTR-214 and Opdivo (n ivolumab) , respectively, for each Combination Therapy T rial with each party bearing its own costs related thereto.
906709_18_ITEM8_P116_S3	Ownership of, and global commercial rights to, NKTR-214 remain solely with us under the Clinical Trial Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	If we wish to license the right to commercialize NKTR-214 in one of certain major market territories prior to September 30, 2018 (Exclusivity Expiration Date), we must first negotiate with BMS, for a period of three months (Negotiation Period), to grant an exclusive license to develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in any of these major market territories.
906709_18_ITEM8_P117_S1	If we do not reach an agreement with BMS for an exclusive license within the Negotiation Period, we will be free to license any right to NKTR-214 to other parties in any territory worldwide except that in the event that we receive a license offer from a third party during a period of 90 calendar days after the end of the Negotiation Period, we will provide BMS ten business days to match the terms of such third-party offer.
906709_18_ITEM8_P117_S2	After the Exclusivity Expiration Date, we are free to license NKTR-214 without any further obligation to BMS.
906709_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	Each party grants to the other party a non-exclusive, worldwide (subject to certain exceptions in the case of the license granted by BMS), non-transferable and royalty-free research and development license to such licensing party s patent rights, technology and regulatory documentation to use its compound solely to the extent necessary to discharge its obligations under the Clinical Trial Agreement with respect to the conduct of the Combination Therapy Trials.
906709_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	The Clinical Trial Agreement will be superseded and replaced by the Strategic Collaboration Agreement entered into between us and BMS on February 13, 2018 (BMS Collaboration Agreement), which is summarized in Note 14, if and when the BMS Collaboration Agreement becomes effective.
906709_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	Other In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we have a number of other collaboration agreements, including with our collaboration partners UCB and Halozyme, under which we are entitled to up to a total of $45.5 million of development milestones upon achievement of certain development objectives, as well as sales milestones upon achievement of annual sales targets and royalties based on net sales of commercialized products, if any.
906709_18_ITEM8_P118_S3	However, given the current phase of development of the potential products under these collaboration agreements, we cannot estimate the probability or timing of achieving these milestones.
906709_18_ITEM8_P118_S4	As of December 31, 2017, we have deferred revenue of approximately $2.9 million related to these other collaboration agreements, which we expect to recognize through 2020, the estimated end of our obligations under those agreements.
906709_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	Note 11 Stock-Based Compensation We issue stock-based awards from our equity incentive plans, which are more fully described in Note 9.
906709_18_ITEM8_P119_S1	Stock-based compensation expense was recognized as follows (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	As of December 31, 2017, total unrecognized compensation costs of $211.8 million related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements are expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.
906709_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	The following table lists the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assumptions used to calculate the fair value of employee and director stock options:
906709_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	We have never paid dividends, nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future; therefore, we used a dividend yield of 0.0%.
906709_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	Our estimate of expected volatility is based on the daily historical trading data of our common stock at the time of grant over a historical period commensurate with the expected life of the stock-based award.
906709_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	We estimated the weighted-average expected life based on the contractual and vesting terms of the stock options, as well as historical cancellation and exercise data.
906709_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	Stock-based compensation expense resulting from our ESPP was not significant in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
906709_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	Summary of Stock Option Activity The table below presents a summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plans (in thousands, except for price per share and contractual life information):
906709_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the option and the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $20.08, $6.54, and $6.55, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $84.0 million, $17.9 million, and $20.5 million, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM8_P126_S2	The estimated fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $19.3 million, $16.7 million, and $16.8 million, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	Summary of RSU Activity A summary of RSU award activity is as follows (in thousands except for per share amounts):
906709_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Aggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the grant price of the award, which is zero, and the closing market price of our common stock on December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	Note 12 Income Taxes Loss before provision for income taxes includes the following components (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	Income tax provision related to continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 35% to pretax loss as follows ( in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P132_S1	The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.
906709_18_ITEM8_P132_S2	At December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax.
906709_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of loss and credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
906709_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which includes the change in the federal rate to 21%.
906709_18_ITEM8_P134_S1	Significant components of our deferred tax assets for federal and state income taxes are as follows (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.
906709_18_ITEM8_P135_S1	Because of our lack of U.S. earnings history, the net U.S. deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.
906709_18_ITEM8_P135_S2	The valuation allowance decreased by $169.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased by $52.5 million and $17.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
906709_18_ITEM8_P135_S3	The decrease in the valuation allowance for year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the change in the federal rate.
906709_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	$35.6 million of income tax benefit at both December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 related to stock-based compensation that will be i ncluded in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations when realized.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	The one-time transition tax is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits (E P) that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S1	As of December 31, 2017, we estimate that there is negative E P on an aggregate basis and we have not recorded a provisional amount for any one-time transition tax triggered by the Tax Act.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S2	We have not yet completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E P for these foreign subsidiaries.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S3	Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S4	This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 foreign E P previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S5	No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S6	As of December 31, 2017, we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1,610.3 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2018.
906709_18_ITEM8_P137_S7	As of December 31, 2017, we had a total state net operating loss carryforward of approximately $474.0 million, portions of which will begin to expire in 2019.
906709_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	Utilization of some of the federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards are subject to annual limitations due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
906709_18_ITEM8_P138_S1	We have federal research credits of approximately $64.0 million, which will begin to expire in 2019 and state research credits of approximately $33.3 million which have no expiration date.
906709_18_ITEM8_P138_S2	We have federal orphan drug credits of $17.7 million which will begin to expire in 2026.
906709_18_ITEM8_P138_S3	These tax credits are subject to the same limitations discussed above.
906709_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	Unrecognized tax benefits We have incurred net operating losses since inception.
906709_18_ITEM8_P139_S1	Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
906709_18_ITEM8_P139_S2	If we are eventually able to recognize our uncertain positions, our effective tax rate may be reduced.
906709_18_ITEM8_P139_S3	We currently have a full valuation allowance against our U.S. net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future.
906709_18_ITEM8_P139_S4	Any adjustments to our uncertain tax positions would result in an adjustment of our net operating loss or tax credit carry forwards rather than resulting in a cash outlay.
906709_18_ITEM8_P140_S0	The decrease in the unrecognized tax benefits in 2015 primarily relates to a California Supreme Court decision relating to the calculation of apportionment of income.
906709_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	We file income tax returns in the U.S., California, Alabama, and India.
906709_18_ITEM8_P141_S1	Because of net operating losses and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our domestic tax years remain open and subject to examination.
906709_18_ITEM8_P141_S2	We are currently under examination in India for the fiscal years ending 2009 and 2016.
906709_18_ITEM8_P141_S3	We have the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	Although it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months, we do not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve mon ths.
906709_18_ITEM8_P142_S1	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no significant interest or penalties were recognized relating to unrecognized tax benefits.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S0	We operate in one business segment which focuses on applying our technology platforms to improve the performance of established drugs and to develop novel drug candidates.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S1	Our business offerings have similar economics and other characteristics, including the nature of products and manufacturing processes, types of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S2	We are comprehensively managed as one business segment by our Chief Executive Officer.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S3	Our revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S4	Lilly and UCB represented 42% and 12% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S5	Revenue from AstraZeneca, UCB, Ophthotech and Roche represented 29%, 21%, 19% and 11% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S6	Revenue from AstraZeneca and UCB represented 57% and 13% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S7	Revenue by geographic area is based on the locations of our partners.
906709_18_ITEM8_P143_S8	The following table sets forth revenue by geographic area (in thousands):
906709_18_ITEM8_P144_S0	At December 31, 2017, $41.7 million, or approximately 88%, of the net book value of our property, plant and equipment was located in the United States and $5.8 million, or approximately 12%, was located in India.

906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S0	On February 13, 2018, we entered into the BMS Collaboration Agreement with BMS, pursuant to which we and BMS will jointly develop NKTR-214, including, without limitation, in combination with BMS s Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab), and other compounds of BMS, us or any third party.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S1	The parties have agreed to jointly commercialize NKTR-214 on a worldwide basis.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S2	BMS will pay us a non-refundable upfront cash payment of $1.0 billion.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S3	We are eligible to receive additional cash payments of a total of up to $1.43 billion upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and a total of up to $350.0 million upon achievement of certain sales milestones.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S4	We will book all worldwide sales and revenue for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S5	We will share global commercialization profits and losses with BMS for NKTR-214, with Nektar sharing 65% and BMS sharing 35% of the net profits and losses.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S6	BMS will lead commercialization for combinations of NKTR-214 with BMS proprietary medicines, and we will lead all other commercialization efforts for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S7	We will have the final decision-making authority regarding the pricing for NKTR-214.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S8	NKTR-214 will be sold on a stand-alone basis and there will be no fixed-dose combinations or co-packaging without the consent of both parties.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S9	Under the BMS Collaboration Agreement, we and BMS will collaborate to develop and conduct clinical studies of NKTR-214 pursuant to a joint development plan, which initially includes a series of registration-enabling trials in more than 20 indications in nine tumor types and may be updated and expanded only upon mutual agreement of the parties.
906709_18_ITEM8_P145_S10	The parties will share the development costs for NKTR-214 in combination regimens based on each party s relative ownership interest in the compounds included in the regimens.
906709_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	Pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement entered into by us and BMS on February 13, 2018 (Purchase Agreement), BMS has also agreed to purchase 8,284,600 shares of our common stock for total cash consideration of $850.0 million, or $102.60 per share.
906709_18_ITEM8_P147_S0	The closing of the share purchase is subject to the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary closing conditions.
906709_18_ITEM8_P147_S1	The closings of the BMS Collaboration Agreement and the Purchase Agreement will be simultaneous and are expected to occur during the second quarter of 2018.
906709_18_ITEM8_P148_S0	The following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data.
906709_18_ITEM8_P148_S1	In our opinion, the unaudited information set forth below has been prepared on the same basis as our audited information and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth herein.
906709_18_ITEM8_P149_S0	We have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results and expect these fluctuations to continue in the future.
906709_18_ITEM8_P149_S1	Due to these and other factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance.
906709_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
906709_18_ITEM8_P150_S1	Such reclassifications have not materially impacted previously reported total revenues, operating loss or net loss.
906709_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	All data is in thousands except per share information.
906709_18_ITEM8_P152_S0	Quarterly loss per share amounts may not total to the year-to-date loss per share due to rounding.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosure.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based upon, and as of the date of, this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P0_S3	Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Based on our evaluation under the framework described in Internal Control Integrated Framework , our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S5	The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S6	We continuously seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal controls.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S7	This results in refinements to processes throughout the Company.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P1_S8	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which was identified in connection with our management s evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P3_S2	These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P3_S4	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
906709_18_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
906709_18_ITEM10_P0_S0	Information relating to our executive officers required by this item is set forth in Part I Item 1 of this report under the caption Executive Officers of the Registrant and is incorporated herein by reference.

906709_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	POWER OF ATTORNEY KNOW ALL PERSON BY THESE PRESENTS, that each person whose signature appears below constitutes and appoints Gil M. Labrucherie and Jillian B. Thomsen and each of them, as his or her true and lawful attorneys-in-fact and agents, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for him or her and in his or her name, place and stead, in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto and other documents in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting unto said attorneys-in-fact and agents and each of them, full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection therewith, as fully to all intents and purposes as he or she might or could do in person, hereby ratify and confirming all that said attorneys-in-fact and agents, or any of them, or their or his or her substitute or substitutes, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof.
906709_18_ITEM15_P51_S1	Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, this report has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated:
906709_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	Pursuant to the Stock Option Grant Notice, which may be in such form (including electronic form) as prescribed by the Administrator from time to time ( Option Notice ), and this Stock Option Agreement, Nektar Therapeutics (the Company ) has granted to you, as of the date of grant specified in the Option Notice (the Date of Grant ), an option under its 2017 Performance Incentive Plan (the Plan ) to purchase the number of shares of the Company s Common Stock indicated in the Option Notice at the exercise price indicated in the Option Notice.
906709_18_ITEM15_P52_S1	Defined terms not explicitly defined in this Stock Option Agreement but defined in the Plan shall have the same definitions as in the Plan.
906709_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	The details of your option are as follows: 1.
906709_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	Subject to the limitations contained herein, your option will vest as provided in the Option Notice, provided that vesting will cease upon the termination of your continuous employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (your Continuous Service ).

906709_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	The number of shares subject to your option and your exercise price per share referenced in the Option Notice may be adjusted from time to time for capitalization adjustments, as provided in the Plan.
906709_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	If you are an employee eligible for overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended ( i.e. , a Non-Exempt Employee ), you may not exercise your option until at least six (6) months following the Date of Grant, notwithstanding any other provision of your option.
906709_18_ITEM15_P55_S1	Payment of the exercise price is due in full upon exercise of all or any part of your option.
906709_18_ITEM15_P56_S0	(c) (i) by delivery of already-owned shares of Common Stock and that are valued at fair market value on the date of exercise (as determined under the Plan), or (ii) a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to you (valued at their fair market value on the exercise date, as determined under the Plan) pursuant to the exercise of the option .
906709_18_ITEM15_P56_S1	Delivery for these purposes and for purposes of any Required Tax Payments, in the sole discretion of the Company at the time your option is exercised, shall include delivery to the Company of your attestation of ownership of such shares of Common Stock in a form approved by the Company.
906709_18_ITEM15_P56_S2	Notwithstanding the foregoing, your option may not be exercised by tender to the Company of Common Stock to the extent such tender would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company s stock.
906709_18_ITEM15_P56_S3	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, your option may not be exercised unless the shares issuable upon exercise of your option are then registered under the Securities Act or, if such shares are not then so registered, the Company has determined that such exercise and issuance would be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
906709_18_ITEM15_P56_S4	The exercise of your option must also comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the option, and the option may not be exercised if the Company determines that the exercise would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.
906709_18_ITEM15_P56_S5	You hereby acknowledge and agree that the manner selected by the Company by which you indicate your consent to your Grant Notice is also deemed to be your execution of your Grant Notice and of this Agreement.
906709_18_ITEM15_P56_S6	You further agree that such manner of indicating consent may be relied upon as your signature for establishing your execution of any documents to be executed in the future in connection with your Award.
906709_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	This Agreement shall be deemed to be signed by the Company and you upon the respective signing by the Company and you of the Grant Notice to which it is attached.

906709_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	For purposes of the option, Disability means a permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code.
906709_18_ITEM15_P58_S2	Note, if you are a US taxpayer and your option is an incentive stock option, to obtain the federal income tax advantages associated with an incentive stock option, the Code requires that at all times beginning on the Date of Grant of your option and ending on the day three (3) months before the date of your option s exercise, you must be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, except in the event of your death or Disability.
906709_18_ITEM15_P58_S3	The Company has provided for extended exercisability of your option under certain circumstances for your benefit but cannot guarantee that your option will necessarily be treated as an incentive stock option if you continue to provide services to the Company or a Subsidiary as a consultant or director after your employment terminates or if you otherwise exercise your option more than three (3) months after the date your employment terminates.
906709_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	(a) You may exercise the vested portion of your option during its term by delivering a Notice of Exercise (in a form designated by the Company), or by completion of such other exercise procedures as may be prescribed by the Administrator from time to time, and payment of the exercise price to the Secretary of the Company, or to such other person as the Company may designate, during regular business hours, together with such additional documents as the Company may then require.
906709_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	(b) By exercising your option you agree that, as a condition to any exercise of your option, the Company may require you to arrange for the payment to the Company of any required tax withholding in connection with such exercise as described in Section 11 below.
906709_18_ITEM15_P59_S2	(c) If your option is an incentive stock option, by exercising your option you agree that you will notify the Company in writing within fifteen (15) days after the date of any disposition of any of the shares of the Common Stock acquired upon exercise of your option that occurs within two (2) years after the date of your option grant or within one (1) year after such shares of Common Stock are transferred upon exercise of your option.
906709_18_ITEM15_P59_S3	Your option is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during your life only by you.
