1096376_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	We are a leading provider of a weight management system based on a low-calorie, portion-controlled, prepared meal program.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages containing a 28-day supply of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts, which they supplement with dairy, fruit, salad, vegetables and low-glycemic carbohydrate items.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	Most of our customers order on an auto-delivery basis ( Auto-Delivery ), in which we send a month s food supply on an ongoing basis until notified by the customer to stop our shipments.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our Core Auto-Delivery program is regularly priced between $300 and $330 per shipment, or about $11 to $12 per day for a full 28 days of Nutrisystem ready-to-go food.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P0_S4	Our food for the Core program is shelf-stable at room temperature and will last for up to two years, making it relatively inexpensive to ship and store.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P0_S5	We have also expanded our product offerings to include a combination of our ready-to-go food and our fresh-frozen line of menu items.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P0_S6	This new Select program is priced higher than the Core program.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our program is based on the following cornerstones that represent who we are to our customers: Results.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	We believe our program enables our customers to lose weight successfully.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Nutrisystem program is based on over 35 years of nutrition research and the science of the low Glycemic Index, and offers over 150 low-calorie, portion-controlled items that are high in fiber, heart healthy and contain good carbohydrates and zero trans fats.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Foods on the lower end of the Glycemic Index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	We sell our weight management programs primarily through a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution approach using the Internet and telephone.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our customers can order 24 hours a day, seven days a week on our website, www.nutrisystem.com, and the food is shipped directly to the customer s door.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S2	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting of a pre-packaged food program and counseling.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our customers can either choose our pre-selected favorites food package or customize their monthly food orders for their specific tastes.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S4	There are no center visits, no measuring foods and no counting calories.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S5	Our Core Auto-Delivery program is regularly priced at about $11 to $12 per day for a full 28 days of Nutrisystem food.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S6	We do not charge membership fees.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P4_S7	Additionally, we advertise various promotional offers and pricing throughout the year.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet provides the privacy that our customers value.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P5_S1	We provide online and telephone counseling and support to our customers using our trained weight loss coaches, diet counselors and other nutrition and dietary staff resulting in no need to travel for a face-to-face meeting.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe that our system offers consumers a sensible approach to losing weight without the use of faddish, unhealthy or unrealistic weight loss methods.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths to grow: Product Efficacy .
1096376_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	We believe our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using our program.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P6_S3	Our customer surveys found that customers lost an average of 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and tended to stay on the program for 10 to 11 weeks (including the one free week most customers obtain with their initial order).
1096376_11_ITEM1_P6_S4	We believe these surveys indicate overall satisfaction with our program and a potential willingness to refer our program to others.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P6_S5	We believe that our brand is generally well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P6_S6	Our company and our predecessors have been in the weight management industry for more than 35 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we generate revenue in our direct channel through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards).
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	We also minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment: we outsource the production of our food products to a number of vendors and we currently outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations to a third party provider.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S3	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight management program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S4	Our customers place their orders through the Internet or over the phone and have their food delivered directly to their homes.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S5	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets which rely on weight-loss centers cannot ensure.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S6	Additionally, we provide our customers with a month of food, including breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert, each day, which removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S7	At a cost of as little as $11 per day, we believe our weight management program offers our customers significant value and is priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P8_S8	In addition, we do not charge a membership fee, whereas many of our competitors do.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S., as well as the global population.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), in 2005 approximately 1.6 billion adults (age 15 and above) globally were overweight and at least 400 million of them were obese.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	WHO projects that by 2015, 2.3 billion people will be overweight and 700 million of these will be obese.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	In the U.S., data from a nationally representative sample surveyed in 2007-2008 found that more than one-third of U.S. adults were obese, with another one-third being overweight.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Nutrisystem is currently operating primarily in the U.S. and Canada.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Gallup surveys indicate that approximately 42% of the people in the U.S., or an estimated 96 million were dieting during 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	Of those people, approximately 56 million were attempting to lose weight and 40 million were attempting to maintain their weight.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	Approximately 8% participated in commercial weight loss programs and 56% conducted some form of self-directed diet.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P13_S3	We believe the Nutrisystem program is well positioned to attract both types of dieters.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight or obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, breathing problems and depression.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these diseases, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	In addition to the health risks, there are also cultural implications for those who are overweight or obese.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	U.S. consumers are inundated with imagery in media, fashion and entertainment that depicts the thin body as the ideal body type.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P15_S2	Despite the high percentage of overweight or obese individuals in the U.S., the popularity of dieting appears to indicate consumers desire to be thin.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors such as Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig, online diet-oriented sites, self-administered products such as the over-the-counter drug Alli and other medically supervised programs.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight management industry.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	By providing a well-recognized food-based program using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	Our Products and Services For more than 35 years, the Nutrisystem name has been recognized as a leader in the weight loss industry.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P17_S5	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting primarily of a pre-packaged food program, online tools and counseling.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P17_S6	Trained counselors are available to answer questions and make recommendations to help each customer achieve and maintain his or her weight loss goal.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	Customers support and encourage each other and share information through hosted Internet chat rooms and bulletin boards.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	These services are complemented with relevant information on diet, nutrition and exercise, which is provided on our community website and emailed to our customers bi-weekly.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	Additionally, online and smart phone weight management tools are available to our customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	These tools include the interactive Mindset Makeover guide, a behavior modification program that was co-authored by an international leader in the field of obesity research and is offered to our customers free of charge.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P18_S4	This insightful and motivational guide walks clients through the program and can serve as an interactive tool for our counselors to use to facilitate communication and enhance weight loss success for our clients.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our Nutrisystem program consists of over 150 low calorie, portion-controlled items that serve as the foundation of a low Glycemic Index diet.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods and foods on the lower end are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our program is perfectly portioned for weight loss and offers a balance of carbohydrate, protein and fat that meets national dietary guidelines.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have also worked to reduce the sodium content of our meal program.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	Including grocery additions, our plans contain 1800-2200 milligrams of sodium per day, consistent with national guidelines.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	In contrast, the average American consumes 2800-4000 milligrams of sodium per day.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P20_S5	We will constantly strive to meet or exceed nutritional guidelines as they are updated.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	We have an agreement with Schwan s Home Service, a provider of fine frozen foods, for the development and distribution of frozen foods under the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	The program, which includes frozen foods ( Nutrisystem Select ), enhances Nutrisystem s tradition of effective weight loss and weight management.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	The full national launch of Nutrisystem Select took place in the first quarter of 2009 but was recently revamped so that most of our weight plans include these fresh-frozen foods.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	The program provides customers with premium fresh-frozen foods that complement Nutrisystem s prepared food weight loss programs and still adhere to Nutrisystem s nutritional guidelines.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	When a customer orders Nutrisystem Select, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	The first shipment will be sent directly to the customer and will contain Nutrisystem s standard shelf-stable food.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	The second shipment will contain the fresh-frozen foods and will be delivered right to the customer s home.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Nutrisystem D Program is a weight loss program specifically designed to produce gradual weight loss in overweight patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	Results from a 2009 clinical study conducted at the Temple University School of Medicine and published in the journal of Postgraduate Medicine show that a pre-packaged, portion controlled meal plan in combination with weekly counseling sessions helped overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes lose more weight and experience greater reductions in their A1C levels as compared to those in the control group.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	This weight loss was also associated with reductions in blood pressure, cholesterol and waist circumference.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P23_S3	A follow up study at the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University School of Medicine was launched in the third quarter of 2010 and is expected to be complete by the end of the second quarter of 2011.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P23_S4	Both research studies were funded by Nutrisystem.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P23_S5	We continue to offer our program at Costco through the use of prepaid program cards.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Nutrisystem program has also been offered at other large retailers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	Each retailer offered a unique promotional package and pricing through the use of prepaid program cards.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	We have discontinued offering our program at underperforming retailers, but we will continually explore other major retailers where we may potentially offer our program in the future.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	In 2008, we also introduced the Flex program ( Nutrisystem Flex ), which is a 28-day program consisting of 20 days of food, our weekends off program, which provides a less restrictive option to meet the needs and lifestyle of an important segment of dieting consumers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	Nutrisystem Flex includes a Recipe Book ( Nutrisystem, My Way ) and a Dining Out Guide to help consumers make healthy choices and stay within the program guidelines on their flex days.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages of shelf-stable and frozen food containing 28 breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts, which they supplement with dairy, fruit, salad, vegetables and low-glycemic carbohydrate items.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	In certain instances, depending on the promotional offers available, customers can receive more than the typical 28 days of food.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	Most customers order through our Auto-Delivery feature.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	Our program is regularly priced for as little as $11 per day.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	By offering a variety of shelf-stable and fresh-frozen foods, we help our customers sustain their weight loss efforts.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	On our website, customers can order food 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	The features of our weight loss program address many of the most common limitations of traditional weight loss programs, including high initiation and recurring membership fees, the inconvenience of traveling to weight loss centers for scheduled appointments and lack of privacy.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	In addition, our prepared meals provide our customers with a structured program with limited weighing and measuring of foods, and no need to count calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	The convenience of home delivery, reduced grocery shopping time, and rapid food preparation also aid compliance.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our food items have accounted for 99% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P27_S4	No other product or service has accounted for more than 1% of consolidated revenue in any of the last three years.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	In January 2008, we expanded operations into Canada and in October 2009, we announced our Nutrisystem J Diet in Japan.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	Approximately 98% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were generated in the United States.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	Marketing Marketing is a core competency that drives sales and builds the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	We have strong expertise in all facets of both offline and online marketing and utilize an integrated marketing process to drive profitable revenue in an efficient, effective way.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	We believe Nutrisystem is one of the leading and most efficient offline direct response advertisers in the industry.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P29_S3	We deploy a hybrid of proven direct response techniques to: 1) build brand equity and awareness; 2) encourage qualified customers to call or visit our website; and 3) deliver profitable sales.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P29_S4	We track response to each advertisement through unique toll-free numbers and URLs and we deploy multi-channel campaigns to target new customers that include television, print, direct mail and telemarketing efforts.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P29_S5	To reactivate lapsed customers and upsell to those already on our program, we utilize a combination of direct mail and telemarketing efforts which complements our other media advertising.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	Our online marketing strategy focuses on driving high-volume, cost-effective, qualified leads to our website with an emphasis on increasing both front-end and back-end conversion through constant testing and optimization.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	We are continually exploring new online opportunities as the market evolves, but focus the majority of our efforts on search optimization (paid and natural), affiliate management, portal relationships, large ad networks, strategic partnerships, targeted display media and internal/external email campaigns.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The consumer and business media outreach programs accentuate Nutrisystem as a leader and innovator in the weight loss category.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Our public relations strategically complement offline and online marketing to increase top-of-mind awareness for Nutrisystem, as well as to foster positive word-of-mouth, in order to enhance purchase consideration of our product.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	The Nutrisystem brand, our marketing and product innovations, as well as celebrities who have lost weight on our program are regularly featured in top-tier media outlets such as: The Today Show, USA TODAY, People Magazine, Access Hollywood, E! News and Forbes.com .
1096376_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	We typically compensate our spokespersons based on their initial weight loss on our program and maintenance of the weight loss over time.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	As a leading ecommerce company and brand, we constantly strive to employ the latest tools and technology in order to drive increased performance of online customer conversion, retention and reactivation.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	We utilize our ecommerce platform to drive a highly-customizable and personalized user experience, as well as to effectively and efficiently manage day-to-day ecommerce business operations.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, we combine internal resources with external agencies in the development of our website information architecture, user interface and user experience.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P32_S3	In order to optimize the key online business drivers, we continually perform usability testing and are constantly optimizing our website using a variety of sophisticated third party testing tools.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P32_S4	Finally, we measure our online interaction with customers, along with broader website performance, via web analytics platforms and tools.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Sales and Counseling A majority of our direct business sales occur on our website.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	The remaining sales are by telephone, and our call center processes virtually all of them.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	Our weight loss program is also sold through QVC, a television home shopping network, which represented 4% of our revenue in 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	As of December 31, 2010 we employed approximately 97 weight loss counselors and 256 sales agents.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P33_S4	Staffing levels for counselors and sales agents are largely a function of the volume of revenue and orders.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Sales agents are responsible for in-bound sales calls and will initiate out-bound sales calls to our leads and other targeted potential customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	Counselors initiate some out-bound sales calls but primarily focus on in-bound calls and email.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	Counselors also handle online web conversations from new visitors and appointments with existing customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	Sales agents are paid primarily on commission while counselors receive an hourly wage.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	We seek to hire counselors with backgrounds in psychology, sociology, nutrition, dietetics or other health-related fields and with suitable temperaments to speak with our customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	Counselors are trained in our meal plan, our Internet chat service, email, motivational techniques and customer service problem solving.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	Sales agents are well-versed in explaining our program and working with our customers to determine the program that would best fit their needs in helping them reach their weight loss goals.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	Customer Service As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately 112 customer service representatives.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P35_S4	Customer service representatives are trained to handle in-bound calls and emails from customers who have questions or problems with an order after the sale transaction is completed.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P35_S5	Typical customer inquiries relate to the arrival date of their order shipment, reporting of missing or damaged items and credits and exchanges.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P35_S6	For email inquiries, we have a software system that scans the customer s email message for key words and automatically supplies the representative with a form response that is reviewed, edited and sent back to the customer.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Customer service representatives are paid an hourly wage.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	We operate an integrated order receipt, billing, picking, shipping and delivery tracking system comprised of proprietary and third party components.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	This system integrates the front end, or website customer interface, with order processing and shipping, and allows Internet customers to access shippers order tracking numbers online.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	Our computer-assisted picking system allows for virtually paperless order picking in all warehouse facilities.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S3	We operate an integrated network of distribution facilities.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S4	In 2009 and 2010, we embarked on several key initiatives within our supply chain, including the installation of new material handling equipment and a new warehouse management system.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S5	These initiatives resulted in realized cost improvements, enhanced vendor productivity and warehouse efficiencies, and they helped increase key metrics supporting customer satisfaction.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S6	In addition, these initiatives resulted in improved inventory management and allowed for us to reduce our overall warehouse footprint.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S7	We currently utilize two outsourced distribution facilities one located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and the other in Sparks, Nevada.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S8	During 2010, 100% of our fulfillment was handled by our outsourced provider.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S9	We have a service agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, which provides for storage, handling and other services, including pricing and minimum space commitments.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P37_S10	The current contract expires on December 17, 2014, but may be terminated sooner upon 180 days written notice.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	We believe that other outside fulfillment providers could be utilized if needed and we continually evaluate the need for secondary fulfillment services.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	We continue to partner with our fulfillment provider to reduce the warehouse order turn-around time for processing and shipping orders.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	In 2010, approximately 99% of all direct customer initial orders were shipped within two business days of the date the order was received.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, we can ship to approximately 99% of the domestic population within five business days using standard ground transportation.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P38_S4	In 2010, we made capital investments in new material handling equipment and a new warehouse management system to target improvements in productivity, cost, quality and service.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	Direct customers are not charged for their orders until the ordered product is shipped.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	We do not charge customers for shipping and handling on Auto-Delivery food orders provided customers take receipt of their second order.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	If a customer cancels before receipt of a second order or postpones his or her second order for more than 30 days, the customer will be charged for shipping and the difference in pricing for an Auto-Delivery order versus a non Auto-Delivery order.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	Product Development All of our foods and supplements are currently outsourced from more than 30 manufacturers or vendors.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	We have entered into supply agreements with many of these food vendors.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	The majority of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P40_S3	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P40_S4	All of these contracts may be terminated by us upon written notice, generally between 30 and 180 days.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P40_S5	We anticipate meeting all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	In 2010, approximately 18%, 17% and 10%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from three suppliers.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	We have supply arrangements with certain of these vendors that require us to make certain minimum purchases.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	In 2009, these vendors supplied 18%, 19% and 8%, respectively, of total purchases and in 2008 these vendors supplied 15%, 19% and 5%, respectively, of total purchases.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our product development team uses a number of sources customer feedback, market trends, nutrition science, and breakthroughs in food technology to create new ideas for our program.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	New foods are created to enhance the variety of our current offerings or to support the efforts of creating a new program.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	Typically, concepts are formulated in the test kitchen to meet our stringent demands for nutrition and stability.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	We then contract with food manufacturers who further develop viable new products based on our specifications.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P42_S4	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste (using testing panels), and cost considerations.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	Our Customers We offer weight loss programs designed for women, men, seniors as well as people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	Based on our customer data, our typical customer is female, approximately 49 years of age and weighs 187 lbs.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	We believe that, on average, our customers want to lose approximately 44 lbs.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	Based on our customer surveys, we believe our typical customers tend to stay on our program for 10 to 11 weeks (including the one free week most customers obtain with their initial order), lose 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and have tried other popular diet programs.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P44_S4	We believe that these surveys indicate a willingness to refer our program to others and that our customers value the following Nutrisystem program attributes:
1096376_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	they do not feel hungry while on the program.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our ecommerce and community websites, both of which are based primarily on third party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in a top tier, co-location facility.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	These facilities provide redundant network connections, an uninterruptible power supply, physical and fire security and diesel generated power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	technologies, including secure sockets layer, or SSL.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	Our customer data is protected against unauthorized access by security measures and we engage a variety of industry leading technology providers including VeriSign, CyberSource and SecureWorks to further ensure the security of our credit card transactions and the safety of our customers personal information.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P47_S2	We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 573 administrative, sales, counseling and customer service personnel, 23 employees dedicated to fulfillment and 51 employees in marketing.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter.
1096376_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet and the placement of our advertising based on the price and availability of certain media.

1096376_11_ITEM1_P54_S12	Effective March 2, 2011, Mr. Falconer ceased to be an executive officer of the Company.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Risks Related to Our Business Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select the right markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our marketing expenditures were $145.9 million, $146.4 million and $174.9 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition cost may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our sales can be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our program which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply and certain fulfillment, Internet, networking and call center services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P2_S4	We rely solely on third party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P2_S5	In 2010, approximately 18%, 17% and 10%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from three suppliers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food and other products in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In 2010, more than 95% of our orders were shipped by one third party, United Parcel Service, or UPS, and 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by another third party, Ozburn-Hessey Logistics, or OHL.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Should UPS or OHL be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing UPS or OHL on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Internet, Networking and Call Center .
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access, networking and call center services, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Further, if our website or call center becomes unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brand and loss of sales.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Therefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) and United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Some of our counselors for our weight management program do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields and have only undergone the training they receive from us.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Such claims could result in damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We may be subject to health-related claims from our customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Our weight loss program does not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S9	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management program.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S10	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S12	However, if we were, we would defend ourselves against such claims.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S13	Defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management program.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P7_S5	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are dependent on certain third party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third party retailers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products and services are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Additionally some agreements contain exclusive rights in specified locations to promote our products during the contract term and for specified years thereafter.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If any third party elects not to renew their agreement or reduces the promotion of our products, our operating profits will suffer.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If we pursue competitive advertising, we may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	If we pursue competitive advertising, our competitors may pursue litigation regardless of its merit and chances of success.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Competitive advertising may include advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our program.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Defending such litigation may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	To succeed, online commerce and communications must provide a secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for all fees charged by us.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We rely on third party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In view of the evolving nature of our business and the seasonality inherent in the weight loss industry, our operating results may fluctuate significantly.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Future acquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	A component of our growth strategy may be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and services.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	Even if we succeed in acquiring or building such businesses, we will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If our brand suffers or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We use spokespersons to promote our products.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If these spokespersons suffer adverse publicity, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight management program.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P15_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If we cannot protect and enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, our brand and our business will suffer.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and competitive position.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights may prove to be inadequate to prevent imitation of our products or services or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights by us.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, others may develop similar trademarks or other intellectual property independently or assert rights in our trademarks and other proprietary rights.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	If so, third parties may seek to block or limit sales of our products and services based on allegations that use of some of our marks or other intellectual property constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S5	If we cannot protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, or if our trademarks or other intellectual property rights infringe upon the rights of third parties, the value of our brand may decline, which would adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S6	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S8	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S9	We have not obtained life insurance on any key executive officers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S10	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, the business could be harmed.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S11	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S12	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P16_S13	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Risks Related to Our Industry Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our program features pre-packaged food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our pre-packaged food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S8	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P17_S9	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	More recently, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	For example, some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and other governmental agencies.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We continue to be subject to these consent decrees, which restrict how we advertise the successes our customers have achieved in losing weight through the program and require us to include the phrase results not typical together with a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our program in advertisements.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In October 2009, the FTC published its revised Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Regulation of advertising practices in the weight loss industry may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	For example, food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, vitamins, nutritional supplements and minerals, including our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenues and profits.
1096376_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	lease two locations in Horsham, Pennsylvania and one in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
1096376_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	These three locations total approximately 258,280 square feet of office space.
1096376_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	One lease in Horsham expires in the first quarter of 2011 and the second expires in 2018.
1096376_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease for our Fort Washington location expires in 2022.
1096376_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	We have additional fulfillment capacity in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_11_ITEM2_P0_S5	We have no lease obligations to any of our outsourced fulfillment providers; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.
1096376_11_ITEM2_P0_S6	Management believes the outsourced fulfillment capacity is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Commencing on October 9, 2007, several putative class action suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc. and certain of its officers and directors as defendants and alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaints purported to bring claims on behalf of a class of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between February 14, 2007 and October 3, 2007 or October 4, 2007.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaints alleged that the defendants issued various materially false and misleading statements relating to the Company s projected performance that had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of its securities.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P0_S3	These actions were consolidated in December 2007 under docket number 07-4215, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on March 7, 2008 that raised the same claims but alleged a class period of February 14, 2007 through February 19, 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P0_S4	The consolidated amended complaint asked the court to (1) certify a class, (2) award compensatory damages, reasonable costs and expenses and (3) grant such other and further relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P0_S5	The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 6, 2008 that was granted by the Court on August 31, 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P0_S6	On September 29, 2009, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on May 19, 2010, upon motion by the plaintiff/appellant, the appeal was dismissed with prejudice without costs to either party.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	Commencing on October 30, 2007, two shareholder derivative suits were filed in the same Court, which were nominally brought on behalf of Nutrisystem, Inc., and named certain of its officers and directors (including four current directors) as defendants.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	The complaints alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment against all defendants and insider selling against certain defendants.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	The complaints were based on many of the same allegations as the putative class action suits described above but added contentions regarding the Company s stock buyback program.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	The two federal action suits were consolidated under docket number 07-4565, and an amended complaint was filed on March 14, 2008 naming four members of the current Board of Directors and certain current and former officers as defendants.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P1_S4	The complaint sought (1) judgment for damages against the individual defendants, (2) declarations that certain defendants were liable for violations of the Exchange Act, (3) an order directing the Company and current director defendants to reform and improve corporate governance, (4) extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief, (5) an award of restitution to Nutrisystem from defendants ordering disgorgement of all profits, benefits and other compensation received, (6) an award to the plaintiff for the costs and disbursements of the action and (7) such other relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P1_S5	Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the Court granted on October 26, 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	A shareholder derivative action was also filed in the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in November 2007.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	Like the federal derivative action described above, the state court action was nominally brought on behalf of the Company and named four members of the current Board of Directors as defendants.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	The complaint sought (1) a determination that the case was a proper derivative action and plaintiff was an appropriate representative, (2) a declaration that each of defendants breached his or her fiduciary duties to Nutrisystem, (3) an award to Nutrisystem of damages sustained by reason of the violations and exemplary damages, (4) an award to the plaintiffs for costs and disbursements and (5) such other relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	On April 30, 2010, the Court sent the plaintiff a notice to terminate pursuant to Pennsylvania s Rules of Civil Procedure for inactive cases.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	The plaintiff took no action and, on October 1, 2010, the Court closed this case.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	On April 27, 2010, counsel for the same shareholder who commenced the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania litigation described above sent a letter relating to the same events that form the bases of the federal putative class action and derivative suits described above.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	breaches of fiduciary duties described above.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	The Board of Directors has appointed a special committee consisting of three independent directors to investigate this demand.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P5_S2	The committee has engaged independent legal counsel to assist it in this investigation, and after the investigation is completed, the committee will provide its recommendation to the entire Board of Directors, who will make the final decision with respect to the Company s response to the shareholder s demand.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P5_S3	The Company also received in November 2007 correspondence from an attorney purporting to represent another Nutrisystem shareholder.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P5_S4	This correspondence requested that the Company s Board of Directors appoint a special litigation committee to investigate unspecified breaches of fiduciary duty.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P5_S5	The disinterested and independent board members met to discuss this issue and responded to the attorney s correspondence.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	The complaint sought (1) judgment against all defendants, (2) equitable and/or injunctive relief as permitted by law, equity and the state statutory provisions, (3) restitution to Nutrisystem from the individual defendants, (4) an award to the plaintiffs of the costs and disbursements of the action and (5) such other relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	Following receipt of additional correspondence from the same attorney in February 2008, the Board of Directors was considering its response when the shareholder commenced a derivative lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in the name of the Company against the entire Board of Directors at that time and certain current and former officers.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P7_S1	The parties reached an agreement to stay this matter pending the disposition of the motion to dismiss the federal securities putative class action complaint described above.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	On April 30, 2010, the Court sent the plaintiff a notice to terminate pursuant to Pennsylvania s Rules of Civil Procedure for inactive cases.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P8_S1	The plaintiff took no action and, on October 1, 2010, the Court closed this case.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	On March 28, 2008, a former Nutrisystem, Inc. sales representative filed a putative collective action complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, docket no. 08-1508, alleging that the Company unlawfully failed to pay him for overtime work in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P9_S1	The complaint purported to bring claims on behalf of a class of current and former sales representatives who had been compensated by the Company pursuant to a commission-based compensation plan, rather than on an hourly basis.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P9_S2	The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on May 28, 2008, adding a state-law class claim under the Pennsylvania Minimum Wage Act, alleging that the Company s compensation plan also violated state law.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P9_S3	The plaintiff sought (1) that the action be certified as a collective action pursuant to Section 216(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, (2) that the action be certified as a class action pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, (3) actual damages for unpaid overtime, (4) liquidated damages, (5) attorneys fees and costs and (6) pre- and post-judgment interest.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P9_S4	The Court dismissed the state-law class claim on July 25, 2008.

1096376_11_ITEM3_P10_S0	On October 14, 2008, plaintiff s counsel mailed notice to potential class members.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P10_S1	Including plaintiff, sixty-eight former and current sales representatives opted-in to this litigation.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P10_S2	On July 24, 2009, the Court heard oral argument on the motions for summary judgment that the parties had previously filed, and on July 31, 2009, the Court entered an Order granting the Company s motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs cross-motion for summary judgment.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P10_S3	The plaintiffs filed an appeal of the Court s Order, and several employee rights organizations and the U.S. Department of Labor filed amicus curiae briefs in this matter.
1096376_11_ITEM3_P10_S4	On June 21, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held oral argument on plaintiffs appeal and on September 7, 2010 affirmed the District Court s grant of summary judgment for the Company.

1096376_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions.
1096376_11_ITEM5_P4_S1	The stock repurchase programs from 2007 had an expiration date of March 31, 2009, but were extended by our Board of Directors until March 31, 2011.
1096376_11_ITEM5_P4_S2	These programs also may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
1096376_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	(2) The period from October 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010 does not include 38,124 shares surrendered by employees to the Company for payment of the minimum tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted common stock.

1096376_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected consolidated financial data presented below has been derived from the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the periods indicated.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	In June 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Technologies, LLC ( Zero Water ) as management determined that the business was no longer aligned with our current strategic direction.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P1_S1	An equity and impairment loss of $4,000 was recorded during 2009 to write-off the remaining investment.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P1_S2	During 2008, we recorded an equity loss of $2,975 for our share of Zero Water s loss and the amortization expense for the difference between the cost and the underlying equity in net assets of Zero Water at the investment date.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P1_S3	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $6,483 during 2008 to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to its estimated fair value.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P1_S4	The impairment charge primarily resulted from lower-than-expected operating results and projections of future performance coupled with the current non-strategic business direction of Zero Water and the overall general economic decline which indicated that the full carrying value of the equity investment was not recoverable.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P1_S5	See the discussion contained in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	In the first quarter of 2010, we committed to a plan to sell the business operations conducted by our subsidiary, Nutrisystem Fresh, Inc. ( NuKitchen ), as it was no longer aligned with the business direction of the Company.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	NuKitchen has been treated as a discontinued operation.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P2_S2	During the third quarter of 2010, this business was shut down as we were unsuccessful in locating a buyer.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P2_S3	Accordingly, the operating results of this discontinued operation have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	The loss on discontinued operations during 2010 was primarily from operations.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009, an impairment charge of $4,541 was recorded in connection with the NuKitchen acquisition.
1096376_11_ITEM6_P4_S1	This charge consisted of $2,717 of goodwill and $1,824 of identifiable intangible assets.

1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, and through QVC, a television shopping network.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the direct channel accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S4	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brand as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S5	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S6	We market our weight management system through television, print, direct mail, Internet and public relations.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S7	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, total revenues, marketing per new customer, operating margins and reactivation revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P1_S8	Our mix of revenue can be divided into three categories.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	First, new customer revenue is all revenue within a quarter from customers joining within that quarter.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	New customer revenue is the main driver of revenue growth.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	Second, on-program revenue is all revenue from customers who joined in previous quarters but who are still within their first nine months on the program.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	Third, reactivation revenue is all revenue generated from customers who are more than nine months from their initial purchase.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	Over the past several years, our financial performance has been adversely impacted by a number of factors, including the economic downturn and declines in consumers discretionary spending.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	We believe these factors have primarily driven the decline in the number of new customer starts during 2008, 2009 and 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	The decline in new customer starts in previous years has also hampered reactivation revenue during 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	We are continuing to see a challenging environment develop in 2011 as we experienced significantly reduced sales below the comparable 2010 period throughout the month of January.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	Our 2011 diet season launch was ineffective in light of intense competitive activity, bargain-focused consumer behavior and weak promotional offerings.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S5	To increase sales effectiveness we re-launched our Rollback pricing strategy, which increased sales traction in the month of February but had a significant negative impact on gross margins.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S6	These factors will have compounding effects through 2011 resulting in decreased revenue and net income.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P3_S7	Additionally, we will incur additional charges during the first quarter of 2011 including severance which we expect to be more than offset by reductions in general and administrative expenses throughout 2011.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our eCommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	current instability in general economic conditions.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	Additionally, we have overhauled our eCommerce platform, redesigned our website and initiated a concerted effort to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay, and overall customer satisfaction.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P5_S2	Our product offerings have expanded to include fresh-frozen foods, and we entered into the retail channel and the Nutrisystem D program.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P5_S3	Further, we have taken steps to reduce our overall operating costs.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P5_S4	In late December 2010, we announced that we were incorporating our fresh-frozen foods into most of our weight loss plans and offering these plans at the lowest price in our history.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P5_S5	Additionally, we have assembled a Culinary Council of industry leading chefs from around the U.S. to act as an advisory board to guide us in developing the best tasting and most desirable foods and menus going forward.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P5_S6	We believe our customers want great tasting, high quality foods at a low price with the ability to personalize and sustain and believe this new Select program will aid in reaching these goals.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P6_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	Management considers the following accounting estimates to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P7_S4	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of product sales revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P7_S5	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $24.1 million, $30.2 million and $47.5 million, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P7_S6	The reserve for returns was $1.0 million and $1.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	One of our suppliers provides for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	We accrue this rebate as purchases are made at a rebate percentage determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the vendor.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory and is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	A receivable is recorded for the estimate of the rebate earned.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	Historically, the actual rebate received from the vendor has closely matched the estimated rebate recorded.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S5	An adjustment is made to the estimate upon determination of the final rebate.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S6	The rebate period is June 1 through May 31 of each year.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S7	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we reduced cost of revenue by $1.9 million, $2.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for these rebates.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P8_S8	A receivable of $541,000 and $1.5 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, has been recorded in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	We continually assess the quantities of inventory on hand to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	We estimate the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecasted demand and/or our ability to sell the products, future production requirements and changes in our customers behavior.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P9_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $419,000 and $1.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings and expectations of future taxable income and other relevant factors.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	We estimate the annual effective income tax rate at the beginning of each year and revise the estimate at each reporting period based on a number of factors including operating results, level of tax exempt interest income and sales by state, among other items.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	Results of Operations Revenue and expenses consist of the following components: Revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Food sales include sales of food, supplements, shipping and handling charges billed to customers and sales credits and adjustments, including product returns.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	No revenue is recorded for food products provided at no charge as part of promotions.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the products sold, including compensation related to fulfillment, the costs of outside fulfillment, incoming and outgoing shipping costs, charge card fees and packing material.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	Cost of products sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S6	Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S7	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S8	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S9	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S10	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P11_S11	General and administrative expense consists of compensation for administrative, information technology, counselors, customer service and sales personnel, share-based payment arrangements, facility expenses, website development costs, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Equity and impairment loss consists of our share of the earnings or losses of our equity interests.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	In June 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Water, as management determined that the business was no longer aligned with our current strategic direction.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	We held approximately a 27% fully diluted interest in Zero Water and had the ability to significantly influence the operations of Zero Water.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	The investment in Zero Water was accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	Interest income, net consists of interest income earned on cash balances and marketable securities, net of interest expense.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	We are subject to corporate level income taxes and record a provision for income taxes based on an estimated effective income tax rate for the year.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	We ceased the operations of two of our subsidiaries, Slim and Tone and NuKitchen.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	Accordingly, the operating results of these discontinued operations have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Overview of the Direct Channel In the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, the direct channel represented 96%, 94% and 93%, respectively, of our revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Net sales through the direct channel were $490.8 million in 2010 compared to $495.4 million in 2009 and $639.0 million in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	The decrease in 2010 is primarily attributable to the decline in reactivation revenue partially offset by an increase in retail revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Revenue is primarily generated through customer starts, reactivation of former customers and the customer ordering behavior, including length of time on our program and the diet program selection.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P15_S4	Critical to increasing customer starts is our ability to deploy marketing dollars while maintaining marketing effectiveness.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P15_S5	Factors influencing our marketing effectiveness include the quality of the advertisements, promotional activity by our competitors, as well as the price and availability of appropriate media.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Overview of Distribution through QVC We distribute our proprietary pre-packaged food through QVC, a television home shopping network.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	In 2010, this channel represented 4% of our revenue as compared to 6% of our revenue in 2009 and 6% in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	On the QVC network, we reach a large audience in a 50-minute infomercial format that enables us to fully convey the benefits of the Nutrisystem diet programs.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	Under the terms of our agreement, QVC viewers purchase Nutrisystem products directly from QVC and are not directed to the Nutrisystem website.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	Retail prices (including shipping and handling) offered on QVC to consumers are similar to prices offered on the website.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P17_S3	We generate a lower gross margin (as a percent of revenue) on sales through QVC relative to the direct channel, but QVC sales require no incremental advertising and marketing expense and, management believes, exposure on QVC raises consumer awareness of the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P17_S4	Net sales through QVC were $18.1 million in 2010, $28.5 million in 2009 and $41.6 million in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P17_S5	The decrease in QVC sales can be primarily attributed to a decrease in the number of shows and quality air time.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	* 2009 has been reclassified for discontinued operations.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	Revenue decreased to $509.5 million in 2010 from $524.6 million in 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The revenue decrease resulted primarily from decreased reactivation revenue and a reduction in sales through QVC partially offset by an increase in retail revenue.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	In 2010, direct revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	In 2009, the comparable percentages were 94% and 6%, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	Cost of revenue decreased to $224.8 million in 2010, from $241.2 million in 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 55.9% in 2010 from 54.0% in 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S6	The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a reduced level of returns, the mix of products with higher gross margins and ongoing cost savings initiatives.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S7	Marketing expense decreased to $145.9 million in 2010 from $146.4 million in 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S8	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to 28.6% in 2010 from 27.9% in 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S9	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2010 promoted the direct business.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S10	The decrease in marketing is attributable to decreased spending in the production of television advertising ($3.2 million).
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S11	This decrease is offset by increased spending in advertising media ($1.5 million) and marketing consulting ($1.4 million).
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S12	In total, media spending was $127.6 million in 2010 and $126.1 million in 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S13	General and administrative expense decreased to $73.9 million in 2010 from $76.4 million in 2009 and as a percent of revenue decreased to 14.5% in 2010 from 14.6% in 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S14	The decrease in spending is primarily attributable to decreased professional, outside and computer services ($3.2 million) due to our focus on cost containment and charges incurred in 2009 to streamline work processes and right size our organization ($1.9 million).
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S15	These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits and temporary help ($1.9 million) and increased non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements ($1.5 million).
1096376_11_ITEM7_P19_S16	Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $11.8 million in 2010 from $11.2 million in 2009 due to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and capital expenditures on our website.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Other (expense) income represents the impact of changes in the Canadian dollar.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	In 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Water because the business was no longer aligned with our current strategic direction.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	An equity and impairment loss of $4.0 million was recorded including the write-off of the remaining investment.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	Interest income, net decreased to $5,000 in 2010 from $104,000 in 2009 primarily due to borrowings under our credit facility during 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P21_S3	In 2010, we recorded income tax expense of $19.3 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 36.3%.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P21_S4	In 2009, we recorded $13.1 million of income tax expense for the reporting period.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P21_S5	The effective tax rate in 2009 was 28.5%.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P21_S6	The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the abandonment of our investment in Zero Water in 2009 which provided an income tax deduction for the entire original $14.3 million tax basis investment in Zero Water and reduced 2009 income tax payments by approximately $5.0 million.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	* 2009 and 2008 have been reclassified for discontinued operations.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	Revenue decreased to $524.6 million in 2009 from $686.2 million in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	The revenue decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in customer starts due to the weakening economy.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	Reactivation revenue in 2009 remained relatively flat compared to 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	In 2009, direct revenue accounted for 94% of total revenue compared to 6% for QVC and less than 1% for other channels.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S6	In 2008, the comparable percentages were 93%, 6% and 1%, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S7	Cost of revenue decreased to $241.2 million in 2009, from $325.2 million in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S8	Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 54.0% in 2009 from 52.6% in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S9	The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to decreased food and freight costs.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S10	Marketing expense decreased to $146.4 million in 2009 from $174.9 million in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S11	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to 27.9% in 2009 from 25.5% in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S12	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2009 promoted the direct business with an increased concentration on the launch of Nutrisystem D.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S13	The decrease in marketing is attributable to decreased spending for advertising media ($27.5 million), the production of television advertising ($567,000) and professional fees and talent ($542,000).
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S14	These decreases offset increased spending in marketing consulting ($587,000).
1096376_11_ITEM7_P22_S15	In total, media spending was $126.1 million in 2009 and $153.6 million in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	General and administrative expense decreased to $76.4 million in 2009 from $86.7 million in 2008 and as a percent of revenue increased to 14.6% in 2009 from 12.6% in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	The decrease in spending is primarily attributable to lower compensation and benefits and temporary help ($8.5 million) and decreased professional, outside and computer services ($1.5 million) due to our focus on cost containment.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	Telephone and internet costs also decreased ($1.1 million) due to lower rates.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	These decreases were partially offset by charges ($1.9 million) in order to streamline work processes and right size our organization.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P23_S4	Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $11.2 million in 2009 from $8.1 million in 2008 due to increased capital expenditures related to our website.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Other income (expense) primarily represents the favorable impact of changes in the Canadian dollar during 2009 as compared to 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	In 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Water, as management determined that the business was no longer aligned with our current strategic direction.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	An equity and impairment loss of $4.0 million was recorded including the write-off of the remaining investment.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	An equity loss of $3.0 million was recorded during 2008 for our share of Zero Water s loss and for the amortization expense for the difference between the cost and the underlying equity in the net assets of Zero Water at the investment date.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $6.5 million to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to its estimated fair value during the fourth quarter of 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	The impairment charge primarily resulted from lower-than-expected operating results and projections of future performance, coupled with the current non-strategic business direction of Zero Water and the overall general economic decline, which indicated that the full carrying value of the equity investment was not recoverable.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Interest income, net decreased to $104,000 in 2009 from $454,000 in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	In 2009, we recorded income tax expense of $13.1 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 28.5%.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	In 2008, we recorded $34.0 million of income tax expense for the reporting period.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P26_S3	The effective tax rate in 2008 was 41.9%.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P26_S4	The decrease is primarily related to our abandonment of our investment in Zero Water.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P26_S5	The abandonment provided an income tax deduction for the entire original $14.3 million tax basis investment in Zero Water and reduced income tax payments by approximately $5.0 million.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P26_S6	The reduction in income tax payments resulted in a similar decrease in income tax expense in 2009, including a reversal of a $3.7 million valuation allowance established in 2008 for deferred tax assets related to prior Zero Water losses and impairment charges not previously considered realizable.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of December 31, 2010, our principal commitments consisted of obligations under supply agreements with food vendors, an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, operating leases and employment contracts.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate continuing requirements for capital expenditures but at reduced levels from 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P27_S2	Following is a summary of our contractual obligations.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P27_S3	We have no other commercial commitments.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company has entered into supply agreements with various food vendors.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	The majority of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Additionally, the Company has entered into an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider which contains minimum space requirements.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P28_S4	The Company anticipates it will meet all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	In October 2007, the Company executed a credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	We borrowed $30.0 million against this facility during 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The credit agreement provides for interest at either a floating rate, which will be a base rate, or a Eurocurrency rate equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the relevant term, plus an applicable margin.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	We are subject to 0.15% per annum unused fee payable quarterly.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	In 2010, we entered into two separate $10.0 million notional value floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) that mature on August 3, 2012 and September 28, 2012, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Under the Swaps, we receive interest equivalent to the three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of interest of 0.75%, with settlements occurring quarterly.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	In addition, we have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	The capital and credit markets have become more volatile as a result of the recent global economic conditions, which has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity and increased financing costs.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Despite these factors, we believe that available capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, dividends and share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	At December 31, 2010, we had net working capital of $74.0 million, a decrease of $29.3 million from the $103.3 million net working capital balance at December 31, 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund the stock repurchase program.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 were $20.4 million, a decrease of $11.8 million from the balance of $32.2 million at December 31, 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S5	In addition, we had $20.8 million invested in marketable securities at December 31, 2010 as compared to $30.3 million at December 31, 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S6	Our principal sources of liquidity during this period were cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S7	We have a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders which is committed until October 2, 2012 with an expansion feature, subject to certain conditions, to increase the facility to $300.0 million.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S8	We borrowed $30.0 million against this facility during 2010 to utilize our low cost debt capital to retire equity capital.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S9	No amounts were borrowed during 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S10	In the year ended December 31, 2010, we generated cash flows of $66.9 million from continuing operations, an increase of $10.3 million from 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S11	The increase in cash flow from operations is primarily attributable to higher net income and non-cash working capital changes primarily from reductions in inventory.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S12	In the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $10.1 million, primarily due to capital expenditures of $19.6 million for the relocation of our corporate headquarters and web initiatives, partially offset by sales of marketable securities of $10.0 million.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P32_S13	In the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash used in financing activities was $68.6 million, primarily for the repurchase of 3,270,429 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $75.0 million and the payment of dividends of $20.7 million, partially offset by the borrowings under our credit facility of $30.0 million.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Our Board of Directors has authorized stock repurchase programs under which an additional $38.8 million of our outstanding shares of common stock may be purchased through March 31, 2011.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P33_S1	The repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P33_S2	The repurchased shares have been retired.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P33_S3	The Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.175 per share, which were paid on March 22, 2010, May 24, 2010, August 19, 2010 and November 22, 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P33_S4	Subsequent to December 31, 2010, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share payable on March 17, 2011 to shareholders of record as of March 7, 2011.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P33_S5	Although the Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to quarterly determination by the Board of Directors following its review of the Company s financial performance.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter.
1096376_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet and the price and availability of certain media.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	variable-rate debt and fixing the interest rate of certain variable-rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	At December 31, 2010, we had two interest rate swap agreements (the Swaps ), with notional amounts of $10.0 million each, which mature on August 3, 2012 and September 28, 2012, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Under the Swaps, we receive interest equivalent to the three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of interest of 0.75% with settlements occurring quarterly.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	At December 31, 2010, we had $30.0 million of debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.09%.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	A 1 percentage point change in the weighted average rate would affect annual interest by approximately $300,000.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	We believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk instruments.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 of $20.4 million were maintained in bank and money market accounts.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Additionally, we invested $20.8 million in marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_11_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As such, a change in interest rates of 1 percentage point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Controls and Procedures The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures by our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial reporting.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company s financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in a reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with management and board of director authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

1096376_11_ITEM9A_P6_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1096376_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1096376_11_ITEM15_P3_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P3_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P3_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1096376_11_ITEM15_P3_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

1096376_11_ITEM15_P9_S0	BACKGROUND Nature of the Business Nutrisystem, Inc. (the Company or Nutrisystem ), a provider of weight management products and services, offers nutritionally balanced weight loss programs based on over 35 years of nutrition research and on the science of the low glycemic index.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P9_S1	The Company s pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel and through QVC, a television shopping network.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P9_S2	Approximately 98% of revenues for each the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were generated in the United States.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P10_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets and liabilities of Nutrisystem, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P10_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

1096376_11_ITEM15_P11_S1	At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, demand accounts and money market accounts comprised all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P12_S0	Marketable securities consist of investments in a bond fund that holds short-term U.S. government securities with original maturities of greater than three months.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P12_S1	The Company classifies these as available-for-sale securities.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P12_S2	The marketable securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P13_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2010 or 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P14_S0	Inventories Inventories consist principally of packaged food held in outside fulfillment locations.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P14_S1	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P14_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P14_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P14_S4	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $419 and $1,179 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P14_S5	Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P15_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally two to seven years.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P16_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P16_S1	Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P17_S0	Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development incurred during the application development stage.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P17_S1	Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally two to five years.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P18_S0	Costs incurred related to planning or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are charged to expense as incurred.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P18_S1	The net book value of capitalized software was $12,845 and $12,332 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P19_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P19_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P19_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P19_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2010, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P21_S0	The functional currency of the Company s Canadian subsidiary is the Canadian dollar.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P21_S1	Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of the financial statement date and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P21_S2	Translation adjustments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P21_S3	Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and were $32 of expense in 2010, $407 of income in 2009 and $1,155 of expense in 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P22_S0	Derivative Instruments Interest rate swap agreements, a type of financial derivative instrument, are utilized by the Company to reduce interest rate risk on credit facility borrowings.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P22_S1	The Company recognizes the interest rate swaps in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P22_S2	The Company has designated and accounted for its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable-rate debt.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P22_S3	The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P22_S4	To the extent that the change in value of the derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is upon transfer of title to the product.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P23_S1	Recognition of revenue upon shipment meets the revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P24_S0	The Company sells prepaid program cards to wholesalers and retailers.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P24_S1	Revenue from these cards is recognized after the card is redeemed online at the Company s website by the customer and the product is shipped to the customer.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P24_S2	Deferred revenue consists primarily of unredeemed prepaid program cards and unshipped frozen foods.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P24_S3	Customers may return unopened product within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P24_S4	Estimated returns are accrued at the time the sale is recognized and actual returns are tracked monthly.

1096376_11_ITEM15_P25_S0	Revenue from product sales includes amounts billed for shipping and handling and is presented net of returns and billed sales tax.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P25_S1	Revenue from shipping and handling charges was $5,763, $5,193 and $5,019 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P25_S2	Shipping-related costs are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P26_S0	Dependence on Suppliers In 2010, approximately 18%, 17% and 10%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from three suppliers.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company has supply arrangements with certain of these vendors that require the Company to make minimum purchases.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P26_S2	In 2009, these vendors supplied approximately 18%, 19% and 8%, respectively, of inventory purchases and in 2008, approximately 15%, 19% and 5%, respectively, of total purchases (see Note 9).

1096376_11_ITEM15_P26_S4	During 2009 and 2008, more than 85% of its fulfillment operations was handled by this third party provider.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P27_S0	Vendor Rebates One of the Company s suppliers provides for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company accounts for this rebate on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percent determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the vendor.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P27_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P27_S3	A receivable is recorded for the estimate of the rebate earned.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P27_S4	A receivable of $541 and $1,478 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, has been recorded in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

1096376_11_ITEM15_P28_S1	An adjustment is made to the estimate upon determination of the final rebate.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P29_S0	Marketing Expense Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P29_S1	Media expense was $127,597, $126,117 and $153,577 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P30_S0	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the direct mailing and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P30_S1	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P30_S2	Typically, this period falls within 40 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P30_S3	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P30_S4	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, $7,152 and $3,529, respectively, of costs have been prepaid for future advertisements and promotions.

1096376_11_ITEM15_P31_S1	The Company records rental costs, including costs related to fixed rent escalation clauses and rent holidays, on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P32_S0	Lease allowances utilized for space improvement are recorded as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P32_S1	Tenant lease incentive allowances received are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P32_S2	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is $3,991 of a tenant improvement allowance at December 31, 2010, of which $345 is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $3,646 in non-current liabilities.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P33_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P33_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P33_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P34_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P34_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P34_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P34_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P34_S4	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P35_S0	The Company is managed and operated as one business.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P35_S1	The entire business is managed by a single management team that reports to the chief executive officer.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P35_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested shares issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P36_S1	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common shareholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P36_S2	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P36_S3	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:
1096376_11_ITEM15_P37_S0	In 2010, 2009 and 2008, common stock equivalents representing 167,158, 527,891 and 604,545 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P38_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P38_S1	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P38_S2	The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P38_S3	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P38_S4	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P39_S1	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $16,660, $11,449 and $36,784 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P39_S2	Interest payments in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $283, $304 and $352, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P39_S3	During 2010, the Company had non-cash capital additions of $3,991 through a tenant improvement allowance and $1,664 of unpaid invoices in accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P40_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P40_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P41_S0	CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES At December 31, 2010, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of continuing operations consisted of the following:
1096376_11_ITEM15_P42_S0	At December 31, 2009, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of continuing operations consisted of the following:
1096376_11_ITEM15_P43_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P44_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P44_S1	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P44_S2	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P45_S0	The fair values of the Company s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P45_S1	The fair values of the Company s derivative instruments are determined using pricing models that take into account contract terms and certain observable current market information such as LIBOR interest rates.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P45_S2	The following table summarizes the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2010:
1096376_11_ITEM15_P46_S0	FIXED ASSETS Fixed assets consist of the following: The increase in fixed assets is primarily due to the relocation of our corporate headquarters during 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P46_S1	Additionally, the Company wrote-off fully depreciated assets of approximately $8,100.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P46_S2	Depreciation and amortization expense was $11,773, $11,177 and $8,093 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P47_S0	GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired certain assets of Power Chow, LLC (d/b/a NuKitchen) ( NuKitchen ), a provider of freshly prepared meals designed to promote weight management and healthy living.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P47_S1	The total purchase price of $5,717 was allocated to identifiable intangible assets ($3,000) and goodwill ($2,717).
1096376_11_ITEM15_P47_S2	As further discussed in Note 12, NuKitchen has been treated as a discontinued operation and the $5,717 purchase price has been included in net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P48_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009, a goodwill impairment charge of $2,717 was recorded as a result of the Company conducting its annual impairment test of goodwill.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P48_S1	Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,824 for identifiable intangible assets.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P49_S0	The Company used a combination of income and market based approaches to estimate the fair value.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P49_S1	The impairment was initially recorded to depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations but has since been classified in discontinued operations (see Note 12).
1096376_11_ITEM15_P49_S2	The impairment charge primarily resulted from management s determination that the resources needed to grow a premium product in a down economy were unsustainable after conducting market tests during the fourth quarter of 2009, particularly with respect to the higher-end consumer segment.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S0	EQUITY INVESTMENT On October 11, 2007, the Company purchased an approximately 27% fully diluted equity interest in Zero Technologies, LLC ( Zero Water ), at a purchase price of $10.60 per Series A unit for an aggregate purchase price of $14,258, which included acquisition costs of $259.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S1	This investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $6,483 to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to its then estimated fair value of $4,000.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S3	The impairment charge primarily resulted from lower-than-expected operating results and projections of future performance coupled with the current non-strategic business direction of Zero Water and the overall general economic decline which indicated that the full carrying value of the equity investment was not recoverable.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S4	The charge was recorded as equity and impairment loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S5	Also, an equity loss of $2,975 was recorded in 2008 for the Company s share of Zero Water s loss and amortization expense for the difference between the cost and the underlying equity in net assets of Zero Water at the investment date.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S6	In June 2009, the Company abandoned its interest in Zero Water as management determined that the business was no longer aligned with the Company s current strategic direction.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P50_S7	An equity and impairment loss of $4,000 was recorded to write-off the remaining investment.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P51_S0	CREDIT FACILITY AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS On October 2, 2007, the Company executed a credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a $200,000 unsecured revolving credit facility with an expansion feature, subject to certain conditions, to increase the facility to $300,000 (the Credit Facility ).
1096376_11_ITEM15_P51_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $30,000 in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at a weighted average interest rate of 1.09%.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P51_S2	No amounts were borrowed during 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P51_S3	During 2008, the Company drew down and repaid the Credit Facility in the amount of $35,000.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P52_S0	The Credit Facility provides for interest at either a floating rate, which will be a base rate, or a Eurocurrency rate equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) for the relevant term, plus an applicable margin.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P52_S1	The base rate will be the higher of the lender s base rate or one-half of one percent above the Federal Funds Rate.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P52_S2	The Credit Facility is also subject to 0.15% per annum unused fee payable quarterly.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P52_S3	During 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company incurred $87, $0 and $49 in interest, respectively, and $294, $304 and $303 in an unused line fee, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P52_S4	Interest payments and unused line fees are classified as interest income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P53_S0	The Credit Facility contains financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio, and includes limitations on, among other things, liens, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P53_S1	The Company may declare and pay cash dividends up to specified amounts if certain ratios are maintained and no events of default have occurred.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P53_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Facility.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P53_S3	At December 31, 2010, the Company had $285 of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility that are being amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P53_S4	The amount of unused Credit Facility at December 31, 2010 was $170,000.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P53_S5	The Credit Facility can be drawn upon through October 2, 2012, at which time all amounts must be repaid.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P54_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument, to manage interest costs and minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations on cash flows associated with its variable-rate debt.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company does not use interest rate derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P55_S0	While interest rate swaps are subject to fluctuations in value, these fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	The Company minimizes the risk of credit loss by entering into these agreements with financial institutions that have high credit ratings.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P56_S1	In November 2010, the Company entered into two separate $10,000 notional value floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) that mature on August 3, 2012 and September 28, 2012, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P56_S2	Under the Swaps, the Company receives interest equivalent to the three-month LIBOR and pays a fixed rate of interest of 0.75%, with settlements occurring quarterly.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P56_S3	The objective of the hedges is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments for $20,000 of floating rate debt.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P56_S4	The Swaps estimated fair value was $(44) as of December 31, 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P56_S5	The corresponding change in fair value is included in other comprehensive income.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	There was no cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recorded during 2010.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Company leases its corporate headquarters and certain equipment.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P58_S1	These leases generally have initial terms of one to 12 years and have renewal options for additional periods.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P58_S2	Certain of the leases also contain escalation clauses based upon increases in costs related to the properties.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P58_S3	Lease obligations, with initial or remaining terms of one or more years, consist of the following at December 31, 2010: Total rent expense for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $3,540, $3,269 and $2,732, respectively.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P59_S0	Litigation Commencing on October 9, 2007, several putative class action suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc. and certain of its officers and directors as defendants and alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P59_S1	The complaints purported to bring claims on behalf of a class of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between February 14, 2007 and October 3, 2007 or October 4, 2007.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P60_S0	defendants issued various materially false and misleading statements relating to the Company s projected performance that had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of its securities.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P60_S1	These actions were consolidated in December 2007 under docket number 07-4215, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on March 7, 2008 that raised the same claims but alleged a class period of February 14, 2007 through February 19, 2008.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P60_S2	The consolidated amended complaint asked the court to (1) certify a class, (2) award compensatory damages, reasonable costs and expenses and (3) grant such other and further relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P60_S3	The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 6, 2008 that was granted by the Court on August 31, 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P60_S4	On September 29, 2009, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on May 19, 2010, upon motion by the plaintiff/appellant, the appeal was dismissed with prejudice without costs to either party.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P61_S0	Commencing on October 30, 2007, two shareholder derivative suits were filed in the same Court, which were nominally brought on behalf of Nutrisystem, Inc., and named certain of its officers and directors (including four current directors) as defendants.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P61_S1	The complaints alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment against all defendants and insider selling against certain defendants.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P61_S2	The complaints were based on many of the same allegations as the putative class action suits described above but added contentions regarding the Company s stock buyback program.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P61_S3	The two federal action suits were consolidated under docket number 07-4565, and an amended complaint was filed on March 14, 2008 naming four members of the current Board of Directors and certain current and former officers as defendants.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P61_S4	The complaint sought (1) judgment for damages against the individual defendants, (2) declarations that certain defendants were liable for violations of the Exchange Act, (3) an order directing the Company and current director defendants to reform and improve corporate governance, (4) extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief, (5) an award of restitution to Nutrisystem from defendants ordering disgorgement of all profits, benefits and other compensation received, (6) an award to the plaintiff for the costs and disbursements of the action and (7) such other relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P61_S5	Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the Court granted on October 26, 2009.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P62_S0	A shareholder derivative action was also filed in the Common Pleas Court of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in November 2007.
1096376_11_ITEM15_P62_S1	Like the federal derivative action described above, the state court action was nominally brought on behalf of the Company and named four members of the current Board of Directors as defendants.

1096376_11_ITEM15_P161_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Overview Nutrisystem, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Nutrisystem, the Company, we, us, or our ) is a leading provider of a weight management system based on a low-calorie, portion-controlled, prepared meal program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages containing a 28-day supply of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts, which they supplement with dairy, fruit, salad, vegetables and low-glycemic carbohydrate items.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	Most of our customers order on an auto-delivery basis ( Auto-Delivery ), in which we send a month s food supply on an ongoing basis until notified by the customer to stop our shipments.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P0_S3	Our food for the Core program is shelf-stable at room temperature and will last for up to two years, making it relatively inexpensive to ship and store.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P0_S4	We have also expanded our product offerings to include a combination of our ready-to-go food and our fresh-frozen line of menu items.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P0_S5	This Select program is priced higher than the Core program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our program is based on the following cornerstones that represent who we are to our customers: Results.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	We believe our program enables our customers to lose weight successfully.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Nutrisystem program is based on 40 years of nutrition research and the science of the low Glycemic Index, and offers over 130 portion-controlled items that include relatively higher amounts of fiber, contain good carbohydrates and zero trans fats.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Foods on the lower end of the Glycemic Index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P3_S2	We also offer transition and maintenance plans, which include support tools and desired meal occasions that customers wish to continue to receive from Nutrisystem.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P3_S3	These plans are designed to help our customers keep the weight off.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	We sell our weight management program primarily through a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution approach using the Internet and telephone.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our customers can order 24 hours a day, seven days a week on our website, www.nutrisystem.com , and the food is shipped directly to the customer s door.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting of a pre-packaged food program and counseling.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our customers can either choose our pre-selected favorites food package or customize their monthly food orders for their specific tastes.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our program does not require customers to visit centers, measure foods or count calories.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P4_S5	The entrees are individually packaged and food preparation time is minimal.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	We do not charge membership fees.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	Additionally, we advertise various promotional offers and pricing throughout the year.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet and telephone provides the privacy that our customers value.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	We provide online and telephone counseling and support to our customers using our trained weight loss coaches, diet counselors and other nutrition and dietary staff, and thus, our customers do not need to travel for a face-to-face meeting.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	Competitive Strengths We believe our program offers consumers a sensible approach to losing weight without the use of faddish, unhealthy or unrealistic weight loss methods.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths to grow: Product Efficacy .
1096376_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using our program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	Our customer surveys found that customers lost an average of 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and tended to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P6_S6	We believe these surveys indicate overall satisfaction with our program and a potential willingness to refer our program to others.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have also sponsored clinical trials at leading academic centers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	The first two trials to report results were in patients with type 2 diabetes.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	Statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in glycemic control were observed in both trials, in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	The second trial also examined medication use and found that the health benefits were achieved while medication use was decreased in approximately 30% of the subjects on our Nutrisystem D Program, which has been specifically designed to produce gradual weight loss in overweight patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe that our brand is well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our company and our predecessors have been in the weight management industry for 40 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we generate revenue in our direct channel through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards).
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	We also minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment: we outsource the production of our food products to a number of vendors and we currently outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations to a third party provider.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight management program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S4	Our customers place their orders through the Internet or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their homes.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S5	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets which rely on weight-loss centers cannot ensure.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S6	Additionally, we provide our customers with a month of food, including daily breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert, which removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S7	We believe our weight management program offers our customers significant value and is priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P10_S8	In addition, we do not charge a membership fee, whereas many of our competitors do.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S., as well as the global population.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	The 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Study estimated that over 78 million U.S. adults were obese in 2009-2010 and the World Health Organization projects that by 2015, 2.3 billion people will be overweight and 700 million of these will be obese.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our clinical trial results and analyses of real world customer results confirm that people who stay on the Nutrisystem program for at least three months have a very high probability of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	In addition to the health risks, there are also cultural implications for those who are overweight or obese.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	U.S. consumers are inundated with imagery in media, fashion and entertainment that depicts the thin body as the ideal body type.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	Studies suggest that there is rampant discrimination against the obese.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Despite the high percentage of overweight and obese individuals in the U.S., the popularity of dieting appears to indicate consumers desire to be thin.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as the over-the-counter drugs and other medically supervised programs.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight management industry.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	By providing a well-recognized food-based program using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P17_S4	Our Products and Services For 40 years, the Nutrisystem name has been recognized as a leader in the weight loss industry.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P17_S5	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting primarily of a pre-packaged food program, online tools and counseling.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P17_S6	Trained counselors are available to answer questions and make recommendations to help each customer achieve and maintain his or her weight loss goal.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Customers support and encourage each other and share information through hosted Internet chat rooms and bulletin boards.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	These services are complemented with relevant information on diet, nutrition and exercise, which is provided on our community website and emailed to our customers bi-weekly.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	Additionally, online and smart phone weight management tools are available to our customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	These tools include the interactive Mindset Makeover guide, a behavior modification program that was co-authored by an international leader in the field of obesity research and is offered to our customers free of charge.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	This insightful and motivational guide walks clients through the program and can serve as an interactive tool for our counselors to use to facilitate communication and enhance weight loss success for our clients.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our Nutrisystem program consists of over 130 portion-controlled items that serve as the foundation of a low Glycemic Index diet.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods and foods on the lower end of the index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our program is portioned for weight loss and offers a balance of carbohydrate, protein and fat that meets national dietary guidelines.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have also worked to reduce the sodium content of our meal program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S3	Including grocery additions, our plans contain 1800-2200 milligrams of sodium per day, consistent with national guidelines, and tailored versions of the plans are available that deliver as low as 1500 mg/day.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S4	In contrast, the average American consumes 2800-4000 milligrams of sodium per day.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S5	We constantly strive to meet or exceed nutritional guidelines as they are updated.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S6	In December 2011, we launched SUCCESS, our most comprehensive program to date.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S7	It is designed to help take the weight off and keep it off through frequent, portion-controlled, balanced nutrition and low Glycemic Index eating.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P20_S8	The SUCCESS program offers our largest ever assortment of signature fresh-frozen meals including new artisanal Chef s Table dinner entrees, developed by Nutrisystem s Celebrity Chef Culinary Council using revolutionary advanced steamer technology; new chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and coffee advanced protein shakes; the introduction of a personalized My Daily 3 physical activity program; and increased personalization and flexibility through transition and maintenance plans that help consumers manage their weight on their own.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	Nutrisystem Select includes fresh-frozen foods and enhances Nutrisystem s tradition of effective weight loss and weight management.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	Most of our weight plans offer these fresh-frozen foods.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	The program provides customers with premium fresh-frozen foods that complement Nutrisystem s prepared food weight loss programs and still adheres to Nutrisystem s nutritional guidelines.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	When a customer orders Nutrisystem Select, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	The first shipment will be sent directly to the customer and will contain Nutrisystem s standard shelf-stable food.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	The second shipment will contain the fresh-frozen foods and will also be delivered directly to the customer s home.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Nutrisystem D Program is a weight loss program specifically designed to produce gradual weight loss in overweight patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	Results from a 2009 clinical study conducted at the Temple University School of Medicine and published in the journal Postgraduate Medicine show that the Nutrisystem D Program in combination with weekly counseling sessions helped overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes lose more weight and experience greater reductions in their A1C levels (a key measure of blood glucose control) as compared to those in the control group.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	This weight loss was also associated with reductions in blood pressure, cholesterol and waist circumference.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	A follow up study at the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University School of Medicine was completed in July 2011 and initial findings were presented at the Obesity Society s annual conference in October 2011, confirming and extending the key findings of the first diabetes trial.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	A third trial in type 2 diabetes is ongoing.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S5	Multiple trials involving the other Nutrisystem programs are recently completed or ongoing.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S6	In addition, several abstracts analyzing real world results from customers were accepted to medical conferences in 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P23_S7	We continue to offer our program at Costco through the use of prepaid program cards and gift cards.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Nutrisystem program has also been offered at other large retailers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	Each retailer is offered a unique promotional package and pricing through the use of prepaid program cards.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	We have discontinued offering our program at underperforming retailers, but we continually explore other major retailers where we may potentially offer our program in the future.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages of shelf-stable and fresh-frozen food containing 28 days of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts, which they supplement with dairy, fruit, salad, vegetables and low-glycemic carbohydrate items.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	In certain instances, depending on the promotional offers available, customers can receive more than the typical 28 days of food.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Most customers order through our Auto-Delivery feature.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	By offering a variety of shelf-stable and fresh-frozen foods, we help our customers sustain their weight loss efforts.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	On our website, customers can order food 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	The transition and maintenance plans included in the SUCCESS launch, along with the previously developed Flex program, allow customers the means to gradually increase their responsibility for grocery shopping and food preparation while adhering to the principles of the Nutrisystem approach.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P26_S4	These lower cost programs help extend the supportive relationship and allow time to reinforce the dietary changes that produced the initial weight loss.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P26_S5	These plans include recipes and portion-control tools in addition to a reduced number of Nutrisystem entrees delivered each month.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The features of our weight loss program address many of the most common limitations of traditional weight loss programs, including high initiation and recurring membership fees, the inconvenience of traveling to weight loss centers for scheduled appointments and lack of privacy.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	In addition, our prepared meals provide our customers with a structured program with limited weighing and measuring of foods, and no need to count calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	We believe that the convenience of home delivery, reduced grocery shopping time, and rapid food preparation also aid customer compliance with our weight loss program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P27_S3	Our food items have accounted for 99% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P27_S4	No other product or service has accounted for more than 1% of consolidated revenue in any of the last three years.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P27_S5	Approximately 99% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were generated in the United States as compared to approximately 98% of our revenues for both of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	Marketing Marketing is a core competency that drives sales and builds the Nutrisystem brand.

1096376_12_ITEM1_P28_S4	We track response to each advertisement through unique toll-free numbers and URLs and we deploy multi-channel campaigns to target new customers that include television, print, direct mail and telemarketing efforts.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P28_S5	To reactivate lapsed customers and upsell to those already on our program, we utilize a combination of direct mail and telemarketing efforts which complements our other media advertising.

1096376_12_ITEM1_P31_S6	Finally, we measure our online interaction with customers, along with broader website performance, via web analytics platforms and tools.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	Sales and Counseling A majority of our direct business sales occur on our website.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	The remaining sales are by telephone, and our call center processes all of them.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	Our weight loss program is also sold through QVC, a television home shopping network, which represented 4% of our revenue in 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	As of December 31, 2011 we employed approximately 73 weight loss counselors and 199 sales agents.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	Staffing levels for counselors and sales agents are largely a function of the volume of revenue and orders.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Additionally, certain sales agents assist in retaining customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	Counselors initiate some out-bound sales calls but primarily focus on in-bound calls and email.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	Counselors also handle online web conversations from new visitors and appointments with existing customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	Sales agents are paid primarily on commission while counselors receive an hourly wage.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S4	We seek to hire counselors with backgrounds in psychology, sociology, nutrition, dietetics or other health-related fields and with suitable temperaments to speak with our customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S5	Counselors are trained in our program, our Internet chat service, email, motivational techniques and customer service problem solving.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S6	Sales agents are well-versed in explaining our program and working with our customers to determine the program that would best fit their needs in helping them reach their weight loss goals.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S7	Customer Service As of December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 90 customer service representatives.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S8	Customer service representatives are trained to handle in-bound calls and emails from customers who have questions or problems with an order after the sale transaction is completed.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S9	Typical customer inquiries relate to the arrival date of the customer s order shipment, reporting of missing or damaged items and credits and exchanges.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P33_S10	For email inquiries, we have a software system that scans the customer s email message for key words and automatically supplies the representative with a form response that is reviewed, edited and sent back to the customer.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Customer service representatives are paid an hourly wage.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	Fulfillment An integrated order receipt, billing, picking, shipping and delivery tracking system comprised of proprietary and third party components is utilized for our orders.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	This system integrates the front end, or website customer interface, with order processing and shipping, and allows Internet customers to access shippers order tracking numbers online.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	Our computer-assisted picking system allows for virtually paperless order picking in all warehouse facilities.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	We utilize an integrated network of distribution facilities through an existing arrangement with our outside fulfillment provider.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S4	In recent years, we have embarked on several key initiatives within our supply chain, including the installation of new material handling equipment and a new warehouse management system.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S5	These initiatives resulted in realized cost improvements, enhanced vendor productivity and warehouse efficiencies, and they helped increase key metrics supporting customer satisfaction.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S6	In addition, these initiatives resulted in improved inventory management and allowed us to reduce our overall warehouse footprint.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S7	We currently utilize four outsourced distribution facilities located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania and two in Sparks, Nevada.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S8	Additionally, we had an agreement, which expired in November 2011, with a provider of fine frozen foods, for the development and distribution of frozen foods under the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S9	We have found other frozen food supply options to replace this supplier.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S10	During 2011, 100% of our fulfillment was handled by two outsourced providers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S11	As of December 31, 2011, all fulfillment was being handled by one outsourced provider.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S12	We have a service agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, which provides for storage, handling of fresh-frozen and ready-to-go foods and other services, including pricing and minimum space commitments.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P35_S13	The current contract expires on December 17, 2014, but may be terminated sooner upon 180 days written notice.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	We believe that other outside fulfillment providers could be utilized if needed and we continually evaluate the need for secondary fulfillment services.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P36_S1	We continue to partner with our fulfillment provider to reduce the warehouse order turn-around time for processing and shipping orders.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P36_S2	In 2011, approximately 99% of all direct customer initial orders were shipped within two business days of the date the order was received.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P36_S3	In addition, we can ship to approximately 99% of the domestic population within five business days using standard ground transportation.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P36_S4	In 2011, we made capital investments in new material handling equipment to target improvements in productivity, cost, quality and service.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Direct customers are not charged for their orders until the ordered product is shipped.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	We do not charge customers for shipping and handling on Auto-Delivery food orders provided customers take receipt of their second order.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	If a customer cancels before receipt of a second order, the customer will be charged for shipping and the difference in pricing for an Auto-Delivery order versus a non Auto-Delivery order.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	All of our foods and supplements are currently outsourced from more than 30 manufacturers or vendors.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	We have entered into supply agreements with some of these food vendors.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	The majority of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S4	All of these contracts may be terminated by us upon written notice, generally between 30 and 180 days.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S5	We anticipate meeting all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S6	In 2011, approximately 16% and 15%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S7	We have a supply arrangement with one of these vendors that requires us to make certain minimum purchases.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S8	In 2010, these vendors supplied 17% and 18%, respectively, of total purchases and in 2009 these vendors supplied 19% and 18%, respectively, of total purchases.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S9	Additionally, we were dependent on one frozen food supplier for less than 20% of our food costs in 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S10	The amount provided from this supplier in 2010 was negligible.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P38_S11	We had a supply agreement with this supplier that expired in November 2011 and we have found other frozen food supply options to replace this supplier.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	Our product development team uses a number of sources customer feedback, market trends, nutrition science, and breakthroughs in food technology to create new ideas for our program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	New foods are created to enhance the variety of our current offerings or to support the efforts of creating a new program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	Typically, concepts are formulated in the test kitchen to meet our stringent demands for nutrition and stability.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	We then contract with food manufacturers who further develop viable new products based on our specifications.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P39_S4	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste (using testing panels), and cost considerations.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our Customers We offer weight loss programs designed for women, men, seniors as well as people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	Based on our customer data, our typical customer is female, approximately 50 years of age and weighs approximately 187 pounds.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	We believe that, on average, our customers want to lose approximately 43 pounds over a period of time.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	Based on our customer surveys, we believe our typical customers tend to stay on our program for 11 to 12 weeks, lose 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and have tried other popular diet programs.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P41_S4	We believe that these surveys indicate a willingness to refer our program to others and that our customers value the following Nutrisystem program attributes:
1096376_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	they do not feel hungry while on the program.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Our ecommerce and community websites, both of which are based primarily on third party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in a top tier, co-location facility.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	These facilities provide redundant network connections, physical and fire security and diesel generated power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely and are intended to provide an uninterruptible power supply.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P43_S4	When our customers place an order or access their account information, we secure that transaction by using some of the best available encryption technologies, including secure sockets layer, or SSL.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P43_S5	Our customer data is protected against unauthorized access by security measures and we engage a variety of industry leading technology providers including VeriSign, CyberSource and SecureWorks to further ensure the security of our credit card transactions and the safety of our customers personal information.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P43_S6	We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 455 administrative, sales, counseling and customer service personnel, 19 employees dedicated to fulfillment and 37 employees in marketing.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

1096376_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	Executive Officers of the Company The Company s executive officers and their respective ages and positions as of December 31, 2011 are as follows:
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Joseph M. Redling has served as our President and Chief Operating Officer since September 2007, as our Chief Executive Officer since May 2008 and as member of our Board since April 2008.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	In November 2008, Mr. Redling became Chairman of our Board.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	Before joining us, Mr. Redling held a number of executive positions at AOL, Inc., a global web services company, including Chief Marketing Officer, President of AOL Access, President of AOL Paid Services and Customer Management and Chief Executive Officer of AOL International from September 2001 through March 2007.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S3	David D. Clark has served as our Chief Financial Officer since November 2007 and in July 2008, the Board promoted Mr. Clark from the position of Senior Vice President, which he had held since November 2007, to Executive Vice President.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S4	Prior to joining us, Mr. Clark was Chief Financial Officer of Claymont Steel Holdings, Inc., a manufacturer of steel plate, from November 2006 through October 2007.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S5	Prior to that, Mr. Clark was Chief Financial Officer of SunCom Wireless Holdings, a publicly traded provider of digital wireless communications services, from its founding in 1997 through February 2006 and held the additional position of Executive Vice President from 2000 through February 2006 and Senior Vice President from 1997 through 2000.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S6	Michael R. Amburgey has served as our Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer since October 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S7	Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Amburgey had been Head of Marketing at Healthways, Inc. during September 2011, and he served as Senior Vice President Consumer Marketing at Schneider Electric from May 2011 to August 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S8	Concurrently, Mr. Amburgey was Partner at Chief Outsiders, a strategic consulting firm that provides chief marketing services, from December 2010 to October 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM1_P51_S9	Previously, Mr. Amburgey was Chief Marketing Officer at Oreck Corporation from September 2008 to October 2010 and served as Vice President of Marketing and Direct Response Sales at Oreck Corporation from September 2007 to September 2008.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our marketing expenditures were $110.9 million, $145.9 million and $146.4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our program which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply and certain fulfillment, Internet, networking and call center services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We rely solely on third party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In 2011, approximately 16% and 15%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food and other products in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In 2011, more than 90% of our orders were shipped by one third party provider and 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by our third party providers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Internet, Networking and Call Center .
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access, networking and call center services, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Further, if our website or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brand and loss of sales.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Therefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) or United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Some of our counselors for our weight management program do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields and have only undergone the training they receive from us.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S6	We may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Our weight loss program does not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S9	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management program.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S10	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S12	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S13	If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S14	Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P6_S15	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management program.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S6	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We are dependent on certain third party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third party retailers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products and services are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Additionally, some agreements contain exclusive rights in specified locations to promote our products during the contract term and for a specified period thereafter.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P8_S4	If any third party elects not to renew their agreement or reduces the promotion of our products, our operating profits will suffer.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	We may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Our competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in competitive advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our program.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P9_S6	Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our website.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P10_S4	In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additional states and governmental entities are considering such notice laws.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our website or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our website or purchasing our services or products.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We rely on third party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S8	We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Our business is seasonal, with revenues generally stronger in the first quarter and weaker in the fourth quarter.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S10	The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S11	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S12	Future acquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S13	A component of our growth strategy may be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and services.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P12_S14	Even if we succeed in acquiring or building such businesses, we will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing shareholders.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P13_S5	If our brand suffers or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We use spokespersons to promote our products.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If these spokespersons suffer adverse publicity, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight management program.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Third parties may infringe on our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S10	In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S12	We may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Third parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S14	Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S15	In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S16	If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P14_S17	Any of these results could reduce our revenues and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our credit agreement contains financial and other covenants.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge ratio and a minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and includes limitations on, among other things, liens, capital expenditures, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement may result in an event of default under the agreement.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S4	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S5	We have not obtained life insurance on any key executive officers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S6	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S8	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P16_S9	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Risks Related to Our Industry Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Our program features pre-packaged food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our pre-packaged food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S8	Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S9	If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S10	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P17_S11	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	More recently, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity, and restrictions of our business operations.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	We continue to be subject to such a consent decree, which, in part, restricts how we advertise the successes our customers have achieved in losing weight through the program and require us to include the phrase results not typical.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In October 2009, the FTC published its revised Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising which now requires us to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our program when using a customer s weight loss testimonial in advertising.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	For example, the labeling and distribution of food products are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and remain unsettled.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, vitamins, nutritional supplements and minerals, including our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_12_ITEM1A_P28_S5	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenues and profits.
1096376_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The lease for our Fort Washington location expires in 2022.
1096376_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	We have additional fulfillment capacity in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	We have no lease obligations to any of our outsourced fulfillment providers; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.
1096376_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	Management believes the outsourced fulfillment capacity is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	Litigation Commencing on October 9, 2007, several putative class action suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc. and certain of its officers and directors as defendants and alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The complaints purported to bring claims on behalf of a class of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between February 14, 2007 and October 3, 2007 or October 4, 2007.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaints alleged that the defendants issued various materially false and misleading statements relating to the Company s projected performance that had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of its securities.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P0_S3	These actions were consolidated in December 2007 under docket number 07-4215, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on March 7, 2008 that raised the same claims but alleged a class period of February 14, 2007 through February 19, 2008.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P0_S4	The consolidated amended complaint asked the court to (1) certify a class, (2) award compensatory damages, reasonable costs and expenses and (3) grant such other and further relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P0_S5	The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 6, 2008 that was granted by the Court on August 31, 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P0_S6	On September 29, 2009, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on May 19, 2010, upon motion by the plaintiff/appellant, the appeal was dismissed with prejudice without costs to either party.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	On April 27, 2010, counsel for a stockholder sent a letter relating to the same events that formed the bases of the federal putative class action described above.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	Specifically, the stockholder has demanded, pursuant to Delaware Chancery Court Rule 23.1, that the Board of Directors (1) undertake (or cause to be undertaken) an independent internal investigation into violations of Delaware law committed by Company management during the time periods described above and (2) commence a civil action against each member of management to recover for the benefit of the Company the amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of their breaches of fiduciary duties described above.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	The Board of Directors appointed a special committee consisting of three independent directors to investigate this demand.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S3	The special committee engaged independent legal counsel to assist it in this investigation.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S4	In April 2011, the special committee, with the assistance of independent legal counsel, completed its investigation and delivered to the Board of Directors the special committee s recommendation that the Company refuse the demands made in the stockholder s letter.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S5	At its April 2011 meeting, the Board of Directors, after deliberation and discussion, unanimously determined to accept the special committee s recommendation as in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S6	Promptly thereafter, the special committee s counsel delivered to the stockholder s counsel a letter informing counsel of the Board of Directors actions and the Company s decision to refuse the stockholder s demands.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S7	In May 2011, the stockholder s counsel sent a letter to the Company s counsel demanding to inspect and make copies of certain specified books, records, minutes and other documents of the Company for the purposes set forth in such letter.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S8	Without waiving any of its rights to challenge the propriety of such purposes under Delaware law, in early June 2011, the Company delivered to the stockholder s counsel copies of certain minutes of the Board of Directors and the special committee according to the terms of a confidentiality agreement that the Company and the stockholder had executed.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P1_S9	The Company has not received any further correspondence or communications from the stockholder or his counsel since that time.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	On August 5, 2011, a lawsuit was filed by a stockholder in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc., certain of its officers and directors, and one of its former officers as defendants and alleging breaches by defendants of their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith and loyalty, unjust enrichment, and aiding and abetting from 2010 to the present in connection with the award of excessive and unwarranted 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Plaintiff specifically claims the action to be a failed say-on-pay shareholder derivative action stemming from the advisory, non-binding vote of the Company s stockholders at its May 12, 2011 annual meeting in which the Company s stockholders did not approve the Company s 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	their fiduciary duties in connection with the Board of Directors compensation practices; (3) the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s failure to respond to the negative say-on-pay vote; and (4) as a result of the foregoing the defendants were unjustly enriched at the expense of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	Accordingly, the complaint asks the court to (1) award judgment against the defendants and in favor of the Company for an unspecified amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of defendants violation of state law, (2) grant extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief as necessary or permitted by law, equity and the statutory provisions cited in the complaint, including disgorgement, attachment, impoundment, imposition of a constructive trust on or otherwise restricting the disposition/exercise of improvidently awarded executive compensation based upon false financial reporting and/or the proceeds of defendants trading activities or their other assets so as to ensure that plaintiff on behalf of the Company has an effective remedy; (3) order the implementation and administration of internal controls and systems at the Company designed to prohibit and prevent excessive and/or unwarranted executive compensation payments to the Company s chief executive, chief financial, and other senior executive officers; (4) award to plaintiff the costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys fees, and accountants and expert fees, costs and expenses; and (5) grant such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	On October 21, 2011 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for failure to adequately plead demand futility.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	On November 21, 2011 plaintiff filed his brief in opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint and alleged that the directors issued false and misleading statements in the Company s proxy statement by stating that the Company adhered to a pay-for-performance policy when in fact it did not.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P4_S2	In its opposition brief, plaintiff abandoned the count contained in its complaint that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s failure to respond to the negative say-on-pay vote.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P4_S3	On December 5, 2011 defendants filed their reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss the complaint.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P4_S4	The court has scheduled a preliminary pretrial conference for March 8, 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P4_S5	The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	On September 1, 2011, a lawsuit was filed by another stockholder in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc., certain of its officers and directors, and one of its former officers as defendants and alleging breaches by defendants of their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith and loyalty, unjust enrichment, and aiding and abetting from 2010 to the present in connection with the award of excessive and unwarranted 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P5_S1	This action stems from the same failed say-on-pay advisory, non-binding vote of the Company s stockholders at its May 12, 2011 annual meeting in which the Company s stockholders did not approve the Company s 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P5_S2	The complaint is listed under docket number 2011-24985 and specifically alleges that (1) the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of certain materially false and misleading statements and omissions of fact in Nutrisystem s Proxy Statement; (2) the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s excessive 2010 executive compensation and the failure to rescind such compensation in response to the negative say-on-pay vote; and (3) as a result of the foregoing the executive defendants were unjustly enriched at the expense of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P5_S3	Accordingly, the complaint asks the court to (1) determine that the action is a proper derivative action maintainable under the law and that demand is excused; (2) award judgment against the defendants and in favor of the Company for an unspecified amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of defendants breaches of fiduciary duties; (3) grant injunctive and other equitable relief as necessary or permitted by law, equity and the statutory provisions cited in the complaint, including disgorgement, attachment, impoundment, imposition of a constructive trust on or otherwise restricting the disposition/exercise of disloyally awarded 2010 executive compensation; (4) direct the Company to take all necessary actions to reform and improve its corporate governance and internal procedures to comply with all applicable laws and to protect the Company and its stockholders from a repeat of the damaging events described in the Complaint; (5) award to plaintiff the costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable allowance of fees and costs for plaintiff s attorneys, experts and accountants; and (6) grant such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	upon which relief may be granted under Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1028(a)(4); and (3) lack of capacity to sue under Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1028(a)(5) because the plaintiff did not make a demand on the company s directors and failed to adequately allege that such demand was excused.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S0	On November 21, 2011, defendants filed a praecipe for argument in which they requested oral argument.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S1	On December 23, 2011, plaintiff filed his opposition to the defendants preliminary objections and alleged that the directors issued false and misleading statements in the Company s proxy statement by stating that the Company adhered to a pay-for-performance policy when in fact it did not.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S2	On January 23, 2012, defendants filed their reply brief in support of their preliminary objections to the complaint.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S3	Oral argument was heard by the court on February 8, 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S4	On February 13, 2012, the court denied the defendants preliminary objections.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S5	The defendants answer to the complaint is now required to be filed by March 13, 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S6	The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S7	The Company is also involved in other various claims and routine litigation matters.
1096376_12_ITEM3_P7_S8	In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future years.

1096376_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	In June 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Technologies, LLC ( Zero Water ) as management determined that the business was no longer aligned with our current strategic direction.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P1_S1	An equity and impairment loss of $4,000 was recorded during 2009 to write-off the remaining investment.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P1_S2	During 2008, we recorded an equity loss of $2,975 for our share of Zero Water s loss and the amortization expense for the difference between the cost and the underlying equity in net assets of Zero Water at the investment date.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P1_S3	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $6,483 during 2008 to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to its estimated fair value.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P1_S4	The impairment charge primarily resulted from lower-than-expected operating results and projections of future performance coupled with the current non-strategic business direction of Zero Water and the overall general economic decline which indicated that the full carrying value of the equity investment was not recoverable.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P1_S5	See the discussion contained in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	In the first quarter of 2010, we committed to a plan to sell the business operations conducted by our subsidiary, Nutrisystem Fresh, Inc. ( NuKitchen ), as it was no longer aligned with the business direction of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	NuKitchen has been treated as a discontinued operation.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P2_S2	During the third quarter of 2010, this business was shut down as we were unsuccessful in locating a buyer.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P2_S3	Accordingly, the operating results of this discontinued operation have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	The loss on discontinued operations during 2010 was primarily from operations.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009, an impairment charge of $4,541 was recorded in connection with the NuKitchen acquisition.
1096376_12_ITEM6_P4_S1	This charge consisted of $2,717 of goodwill and $1,824 of identifiable intangible assets.

1096376_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Nutrisystem programs are based on 40 years of nutrition research and on the science of the low Glycemic Index.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, and through QVC, a television shopping network.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Approximately 80% of our order volumes are processed through the Internet.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	For 2011, 2010 and 2009, the direct channel accounted for 95%, 96% and 94%, respectively, of total revenue compared to 4%, 4% and 6%, respectively, for QVC.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	During 2011, 1% of total revenue came from other channels.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brand as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S6	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S7	We market our weight management system through television, print, direct mail, Internet and public relations.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S8	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, total revenues, marketing per new customer, operating margins and reactivation revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P2_S9	Our mix of revenue can be divided into three categories.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	First, new customer revenue is all revenue within a quarter from customers joining within that quarter.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	New customer revenue is the main driver of revenue growth.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Second, on-program revenue is all revenue from customers who joined in previous quarters but who are still within their first nine months on the program.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	Third, reactivation revenue is all revenue generated from customers who are more than nine months from their initial purchase.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our eCommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe this flexibility is especially valuable due to the current instability in general economic conditions.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additionally, we initiated a concerted effort to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay, and overall customer satisfaction and are continuously redesigning our eCommerce platform and website.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P4_S3	Our product offerings have expanded to include fresh-frozen foods, and we entered into the retail channel and introduced the Nutrisystem D program during the last several years.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P4_S4	Further, we have taken steps to reduce our overall operating costs.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Over the past several years, our financial performance has been adversely impacted by a number of factors, including the economic downturn and declines in consumers discretionary spending.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	We believe these factors have primarily driven the decline in the number of new customer starts which in turn began to hamper reactivation revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	We continued to see a challenging environment in 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our plan for 2011, a year that we expected to be challenging from a revenue standpoint, was to optimize our business model to maximize profitability and cash flow, strengthen our balance sheet, return cash to stockholders, and invest in growth initiatives for 2012 and beyond.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	We experienced significantly reduced sales below the comparable 2010 period throughout the month of January.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	Our 2011 diet season launch was ineffective in light of intense competitive activity, bargain-focused consumer behavior and weak promotional offerings.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	To increase sales effectiveness, we re-launched our Rollback pricing strategy, which increased sales traction in the months of February and March but had a negative impact on gross margins offset by increased marketing efficiency.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	Similarly, the remaining months of 2011 were also hampered by continued bargain-focused consumer behavior and economic concerns.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	We continued to react with discounted sales promotions thus reducing average selling prices and gross margins partially offset by increased marketing efficiency.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	Additionally, we incurred severance and other related charges of $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2011, which were more than offset by reductions in general and administrative expenses throughout the remainder of 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	In December 2011, we launched SUCCESS, our most comprehensive program to date and teamed with new celebrities for new national ad campaigns.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	The SUCCESS program is designed to help take the weight off and keep it off through frequent, portion-controlled, balanced nutrition and low Glycemic Index eating.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	It offers our largest ever assortment of signature fresh-frozen meals including new artisanal Chef s Table dinner entrees, developed by Nutrisystem s Celebrity Chef Culinary Council using revolutionary advanced steamer technology; new chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and coffee advanced protein shakes; the introduction of a personalized My Daily 3 physical activity program; and increased personalization and flexibility through transition and maintenance plans that help consumers manage their weight on their own.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	SUCCESS replaced our Nutrisystem Advanced program resulting in additional costs during the fourth quarter of 2011 primarily for marketing, packaging and increased reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and returns.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Management considers the following accounting estimates to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of product sales revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S5	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $12.9 million, $24.1 million and $30.2 million, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S6	The decrease in the provision during 2011 was due to the decrease in revenue and a decrease in the return rate due to system improvements which offset the additional reserve for the new program launch.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P10_S7	The reserve for returns incurred but not received and processed was $726,000 and $1.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and has been included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	We continually assess the quantities of inventory on hand to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	We estimate the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecasted demand and/or our ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in our customers behavior.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $769,000 and $419,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increase in the reserve was due to the new program launch in December 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings and expectations of future taxable income and other relevant factors.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	We estimate the annual effective income tax rate at the beginning of each year and revise the estimate at each reporting period based on a number of factors including operating results, level of tax exempt interest income and sales by state, among other items.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Results of Operations Revenue and expenses consist of the following components: Revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	Food sales include sales of food, supplements, shipping and handling charges billed to customers and sales credits and adjustments, including product returns.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	No revenue is recorded for food products provided at no charge as part of promotions.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S4	Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the products sold, including compensation related to fulfillment, the costs of outside fulfillment, incoming and outgoing shipping costs, charge card fees and packing material.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S5	Cost of products sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S6	Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S7	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S8	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S9	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S10	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P14_S11	General and administrative expense consists of compensation for administrative, information technology, counselors, customer service and sales personnel, share-based payment arrangements for related employees, facility expenses, website development costs, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Equity and impairment loss consisted of our share of the earnings or losses of our equity interests.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	In June 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Water, as it was determined that the business was no longer aligned with our strategic direction.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	We held approximately a 27% fully diluted interest in Zero Water.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The investment in Zero Water was accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Interest (expense) income, net consists of interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness net of interest income earned on cash balances and marketable securities.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	We are subject to corporate level income taxes and record a provision for income taxes based on an estimated effective income tax rate for the year.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	We ceased the operations of two of our subsidiaries, Slim and Tone and NuKitchen.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	Accordingly, the operating results of these discontinued operations have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	Overview of the Direct Channel In the years ended 2011, 2010 and 2009, the direct channel represented 95%, 96% and 94%, respectively, of our revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Revenues through the direct channel were $382.8 million in 2011 compared to $490.8 million in 2010 and $495.4 million in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P19_S2	Revenue is primarily generated through customer starts, reactivation of former customers and the customer ordering behavior, including length of time on our program and the diet program selection.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P19_S3	The decrease in 2011 is primarily attributable to lower average selling prices, discounted promotional offerings and declines in new customers, on-program revenue and reactivation revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	Critical to increasing customer starts is our ability to deploy marketing dollars while maintaining marketing effectiveness.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P20_S1	Factors influencing our marketing effectiveness include the quality of the advertisements, promotional activity by our competitors, as well as the price and availability of appropriate media.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S1	Revenue decreased to $401.4 million in 2011 from $509.5 million in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S2	The revenue decline occurred across all of our sales channels primarily due to lower average selling prices and fewer customer starts and on-program customers as a result of bargain-focused consumer behavior and discounted promotional offerings.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S3	In 2011, direct revenue accounted for 95% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC and 1% for other channels.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S4	In 2010, direct revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S5	Cost of revenue decreased to $198.4 million in 2011 from $224.8 million in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S6	Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 50.6% in 2011 from 55.9% in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P21_S7	The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to our promotional pricing and to an increase in the sales of our fresh-frozen food programs, which have a higher cost per sales dollar.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Marketing expense decreased to $110.9 million in 2011 from $145.9 million in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue decreased to 27.6% in 2011 from 28.6% in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	During the beginning of the first quarter of 2011, we experienced significant pressures on response and conversion rates across all sales channels causing a decrease in new customers and directly impacting our marketing efficiency.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	As a result, we reduced the spending for advertising media but increased our promotional incentives to increase demand and leverage marketing efficiency.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2011 promoted the direct business.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S1	The decrease in marketing is attributable to decreased spending in media ($38.8 million) partially offset by increased spending for the production of television advertising ($3.7 million).
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S2	In total, media spending was $88.8 million in 2011 and $127.6 million in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S3	General and administrative expense decreased to $60.8 million in 2011 from $73.9 million in 2010 and as a percent of revenue increased to 15.2% in 2011 from 14.5% in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S4	The decrease was is primarily attributable to lower compensation, benefits and temporary help ($7.8 million), decreased professional and outside computer services ($2.1 million), lower facilities expense ($1.3 million) and decreased non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements ($1.9 million).
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S5	We implemented a series of measures, including reductions in headcount and outside professional services during the first quarter of 2011 that resulted in reductions in our general and administrative expenses.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S6	Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $12.1 million in 2011 from $11.8 million in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S7	Interest expense, net, was $468,000 in 2011 compared to interest income, net, of $5,000 in the comparable period of 2010 due to increased average borrowings outstanding during 2011 under our credit facility.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S8	In 2011, we recorded income tax expense of $6.4 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 34.3% as compared to $19.3 million of income tax expense in 2010 with an effective tax rate of 36.3%.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P24_S9	The change in the effective tax rate was due to the impact of limitations on executive compensation deductions and food donations in comparison to pre-tax income, as well as reductions in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations during the fourth quarter of 2011 and tax credits and other miscellaneous adjustments occurring throughout the year.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Revenue decreased to $509.5 million in 2010 from $524.6 million in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S1	The revenue decrease resulted primarily from decreased reactivation revenue and a reduction in sales through QVC partially offset by an increase in retail revenue.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S2	In 2010, direct revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S3	In 2009, direct revenue accounted for 94% of total revenue compared to 6% for QVC.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S4	Cost of revenue decreased to $224.8 million in 2010, from $241.2 million in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S5	Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 55.9% in 2010 from 54.0% in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S6	The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to a reduced level of returns, the mix of products with higher gross margins and ongoing cost savings initiatives.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S7	Marketing expense decreased to $145.9 million in 2010 from $146.4 million in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S8	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to 28.6% in 2010 from 27.9% in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S9	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2010 promoted the direct business.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S10	The decrease in marketing is attributable to decreased spending in the production of television advertising ($3.2 million).
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S11	This decrease is partially offset by increased spending in advertising media ($1.5 million) and marketing consulting ($1.4 million).
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S12	In total, media spending was $127.6 million in 2010 and $126.1 million in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S13	General and administrative expense decreased to $73.9 million in 2010 from $76.4 million in 2009 and as a percent of revenue decreased to 14.5% in 2010 from 14.6% in 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S14	The decrease in spending is primarily attributable to decreased professional, outside and computer services ($3.2 million) due to our focus on cost containment and charges incurred in 2009 to streamline work processes and right size our organization ($1.9 million).
1096376_12_ITEM7_P25_S15	These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits and temporary help ($1.9 million) and increased non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements ($1.5 million).
1096376_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $11.8 million in 2010 from $11.2 million in 2009 due to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and capital expenditures on our website.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Other (expense) income represents the impact of changes in the Canadian dollar.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	In 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Water because the business was no longer aligned with our strategic direction.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	An equity and impairment loss of $4.0 million was recorded including the write-off of the remaining investment.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	Interest income, net decreased to $5,000 in 2010 from $104,000 in 2009 primarily due to borrowings under our credit facility during 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	In 2010, we recorded income tax expense of $19.3 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 36.3% as compared to $13.1 million of income tax expense in 2009 at an effective tax rate of 28.5%.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the abandonment of our investment in Zero Water in 2009 which provided an income tax deduction for the entire original $14.3 million tax basis investment in Zero Water and reduced 2009 income tax payments by approximately $5.0 million.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	As of December 31, 2011, our principal commitments consisted of obligations under supply agreements with food vendors, an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, operating leases and employment contracts.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate continuing requirements for capital expenditures.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Following is a summary of our contractual obligations.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S3	We have no other commercial commitments.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S4	We have entered into supply agreements with various food vendors.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S5	The majority of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S6	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S7	Additionally, we have entered into an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider which contains minimum space requirements.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P28_S8	We anticipate that we will meet all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	In December 2011, the Company executed an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility through December 5, 2016.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Our previous $200.0 million facility was set to expire in October 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P29_S2	We borrowed $30.0 million against this facility during 2011 which was used to repay amounts outstanding under the old facility.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	The credit agreement provides for interest at either a floating rate, which will be a base rate, or a Eurocurrency rate equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the relevant term, plus an applicable margin.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	We are subject to an unused fee payable quarterly.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	In 2010, we entered into two separate $10.0 million notional value floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) that mature on August 3, 2012 and September 28, 2012, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Under the Swaps, we receive interest equivalent to the three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of interest of 0.75%, with settlements occurring quarterly.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P32_S2	In January 2012, we entered into a third $10.0 million notional value interest rate swap for the amended and restated credit agreement.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P32_S3	In addition, we have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The capital and credit markets have become more volatile as a result of the recent global economic conditions, which has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity and increased financing costs.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	Despite these factors, we believe that available capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, dividends and share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	As our previous credit agreement was set to expire in 2012, we entered into a $100 million amended and restated credit agreement that extended the commitment period and replaced our previous agreement.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	At December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $76.2 million, an increase of $2.2 million from the $74.0 million working capital balance at December 31, 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P34_S2	Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 were $47.6 million, an increase of $27.2 million from the balance of $20.4 million at December 31, 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P34_S3	In addition, we had $10.0 million invested in marketable securities at December 31, 2011 as compared to $20.8 million at December 31, 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P34_S4	Our principal sources of liquidity during this period were cash flows from operations.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	We have a $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of lenders which is committed until December 5, 2016 with an expansion feature, subject to certain conditions, to increase the facility to $180.0 million.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	In 2011, we generated cash flow of $47.3 million from operating activities, a decrease of $19.3 million from 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	The decrease in cash flow from operations is primarily attributable to lower net income for 2011 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by inventory balances and the use of supplier advances.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	In 2011, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.9 million primarily from the $20.9 million sale of marketable securities reduced by purchases of marketable securities of $10.1 million and capital additions of $8.0 million.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	We are continuing to invest in our ecommerce and web platform to incorporate new product initiatives.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	In 2011, net cash used in financing activities was $23.0 million, a decrease of $45.6 million from 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	During 2011, we did not repurchase any of our shares of common stock as compared to $75.0 million spent to purchase shares in 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P37_S2	On July 28, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Stock Market or through privately negotiated transactions, including block transactions.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P37_S3	The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P37_S4	The stock repurchase program has an expiration date of June 30, 2013 but may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.175 per share, which were paid on March 17, 2011, May 19, 2011, August 18, 2011 and November 25, 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P38_S1	Subsequent to December 31, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share payable on March 26, 2012 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P38_S2	Although we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to quarterly determination by our Board of Directors following its review of our financial performance.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter.
1096376_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet and the price and availability of certain media.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We have interest-rate risk exposure for changes in interest rates relating to our outstanding borrowings.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a combination of variable-rate debt and fixing the interest rate of certain variable-rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	At December 31, 2011, we had two interest rate swap agreements (the Swaps ), with notional amounts of $10.0 million each, which mature on August 3, 2012 and September 28, 2012, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Under the Swaps, we receive interest equivalent to the three-month LIBOR and pay a fixed rate of interest of 0.75% with settlements occurring quarterly.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P0_S4	In January 2012, we entered into a third $10.0 million notional value interest rate swap for the amended and restated credit agreement.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P0_S5	At December 31, 2011, we had $30.0 million of debt outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 1.26%.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P0_S6	A 1 percentage point change in the weighted average rate would affect annual interest by approximately $300,000.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	We believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk instruments.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 of $47.6 million were maintained in bank and money market accounts.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Additionally, we invested $10.0 million in marketable securities, which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	As such, a change in interest rates of 1 percentage point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P12_S4	The marketable securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P13_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2011 or 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P14_S0	Inventories Inventories consist principally of packaged food held in outside fulfillment locations.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P14_S1	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P14_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P14_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P20_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P20_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P20_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2011, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P23_S3	The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P23_S4	To the extent that the change in value of the derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P26_S3	Both shipments qualify as separate units of accounting and the fair value is based on the estimated selling price of both units.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P26_S4	Customers may return unopened product within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P26_S5	Fresh-frozen products are non-returnable and non-refundable unless the order is canceled within seven days of delivery.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P27_S4	The amount provided from this supplier in 2010 was negligible.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P27_S5	The Company had a supply agreement with this supplier that expired in November 2011 and the Company has found other frozen food supply options to replace this supplier.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P28_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company outsourced 100% of its fulfillment operations to third party providers.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P29_S0	Vendor Rebates One of the Company s suppliers provides for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company accounts for this rebate on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percent determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the vendor.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P29_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P29_S3	A receivable is recorded for the estimate of the rebate earned.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P29_S4	The rebate period is June 1 through May 31 of each year.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P32_S0	costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the direct mailing and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P32_S1	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P32_S2	Typically, this period falls within 40 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P32_S3	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P32_S4	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, $4,800 and $7,152, respectively, of costs have been prepaid for future advertisements and promotions.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P34_S0	Lease allowances utilized for space improvement are recorded as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P34_S1	Tenant lease incentive allowances received are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P34_S2	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is $3,646 of a tenant improvement allowance at December 31, 2011, of which $345 is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $3,301 in non-current liabilities.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P35_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P35_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P35_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P36_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P36_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P36_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P36_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P37_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P38_S0	Earnings Per Share The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P39_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P39_S1	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P39_S2	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS: In 2011, 2010 and 2009, common stock equivalents representing 656,871, 167,158 and 527,891 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P40_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P41_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P41_S1	The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P41_S2	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P41_S3	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P42_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P43_S0	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $6,049, $16,660 and $11,449 in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P44_S0	No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU No. 2011-05 ) amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income: (1) in a single continuous financial statement, statement of comprehensive income or (2) in two separate but consecutive financial statements, consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P44_S1	ASU No. 2011-05 requires retrospective application, and it is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P44_S2	The Company believes the adoption of this update will change the order in which certain financial statements are presented and provide additional detail on those financial statements when applicable, but will not have any other impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P45_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P45_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P46_S0	Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P49_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P50_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P50_S1	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P50_S2	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P51_S0	The fair values of the Company s cash equivalents and marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P51_S1	The fair values of the Company s derivative instruments are determined using pricing models that take into account contract terms and certain observable current market information such as London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) interest rates.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P51_S2	The following table summarizes the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2011:
1096376_12_ITEM15_P51_S3	The following table summarizes the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2010:
1096376_12_ITEM15_P52_S0	FIXED ASSETS Fixed assets consist of the following: Depreciation and amortization expense was $12,068, $11,773 and $11,177 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P53_S0	GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired certain assets of Power Chow, LLC (d/b/a NuKitchen) ( NuKitchen ), a provider of freshly prepared meals designed to promote weight management and healthy living.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P53_S1	The total purchase price of $5,717 was allocated to identifiable intangible assets ($3,000) and goodwill ($2,717).
1096376_12_ITEM15_P53_S2	As further discussed in Note 12, NuKitchen has been treated as a discontinued operation in 2010 and 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P54_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009, a goodwill impairment charge of $2,717 was recorded as a result of the Company conducting its annual impairment test of goodwill.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P54_S1	Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1,824 for identifiable intangible assets.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P55_S0	The Company used a combination of income and market based approaches to estimate the fair value.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P55_S1	The impairment is classified in discontinued operations (see Note 12).
1096376_12_ITEM15_P55_S2	The impairment charge primarily resulted from management s determination that the resources needed to grow a premium product in a down economy were unsustainable after conducting market tests during the fourth quarter of 2009, particularly with respect to the higher-end consumer segment.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P56_S0	EQUITY INVESTMENT On October 11, 2007, the Company purchased an approximately 27% fully diluted equity interest in Zero Technologies, LLC ( Zero Water ), at a purchase price of $14,258.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P56_S1	This investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P56_S2	In June 2009, the Company abandoned its interest in Zero Water as management determined that the business was no longer aligned with the Company s strategic direction.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P56_S3	An equity and impairment loss of $4,000 was recorded to write-off the remaining investment.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P57_S0	CREDIT FACILITY AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS On December 5, 2011, the Company executed an amended and restated credit agreement with a group of lenders that provides for a $100,000 unsecured revolving credit facility with an expansion feature, subject to certain conditions, to increase the facility to $180,000 (the Credit Facility ).
1096376_12_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Credit Facility replaced the $200,000 facility that was expiring in October 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P57_S2	The Company borrowed $30,000 million against the Credit Facility during 2011 which was used to repay amounts outstanding under the old facility.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P57_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $30,000 in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at a weighted average interest rate of 1.26%.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Credit Facility provides for interest at either a floating rate, which will be a base rate, or a Eurocurrency rate equal to LIBOR for the relevant term, plus an applicable margin.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P59_S0	base rate or one-half of one percent above the Federal Funds Rate.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Credit Facility is also subject to an unused fee payable quarterly.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P59_S2	The unused fee is subject to adjustment based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio and ranges from 0.25-0.45% per year.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P59_S3	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company incurred $417, $87 and $0 in interest, respectively, and $279, $294 and $304 in an unused line fee, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P59_S4	Interest payments and unused line fees are classified within interest (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Credit Facility contains financial and other covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge ratio and a minimum consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and includes limitations on, among other things, liens, capital expenditures, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P60_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Facility.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P60_S2	At December 31, 2011, the Company had $1,097 of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility, of which $991 were incurred in December 2011 for amending the Credit Facility.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P60_S3	These costs are being amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P60_S4	The amount of unused Credit Facility at December 31, 2011 was $70,000.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P60_S5	The Credit Facility can be drawn upon through December 5, 2016, at which time all amounts must be repaid.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company uses interest rate swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument, to manage interest costs and minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations on cash flows associated with its variable-rate debt.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P61_S1	The Company does not use interest rate derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P62_S0	While interest rate swaps are subject to fluctuations in value, these fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P63_S0	The Company minimizes the risk of credit loss by entering into these agreements with financial institutions that have high credit ratings.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P63_S1	In November 2010, the Company entered into two separate $10,000 notional value floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) that mature on August 3, 2012 and September 28, 2012, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P63_S2	Under the Swaps, the Company receives interest equivalent to the three-month LIBOR and pays a fixed rate of interest of 0.75%, with settlements occurring quarterly.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P63_S3	The objective of the hedges is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments for $20,000 of floating rate debt.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P63_S4	The Swaps estimated fair value was a liability of $22 and $44 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P63_S5	The corresponding change in fair value is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P64_S0	There were no amounts of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recorded during 2011 or 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P64_S1	The Company expects a liability of $22 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months as both Swaps mature in 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P65_S0	In January 2012, we entered into a third $10,000 notional value interest rate swap for the amended and restated credit agreement.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P66_S0	The Company leases its corporate headquarters and certain equipment.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P66_S1	These leases generally have initial terms of one to 12 years and have renewal options for additional periods.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P66_S2	Certain of the leases also contain escalation clauses based upon increases in costs related to the properties.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P67_S0	Lease obligations, with initial or remaining terms of one or more years, consist of the following at December 31, 2011:
1096376_12_ITEM15_P68_S0	Total rent expense for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $3,136, $3,540 and $3,269, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P69_S0	Litigation Commencing on October 9, 2007, several putative class action suits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc. and certain of its officers and directors as defendants and alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P69_S1	The complaints purported to bring claims on behalf of a class of persons who purchased the Company s common stock between February 14, 2007 and October 3, 2007 or October 4, 2007.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P69_S2	The complaints alleged that the defendants issued various materially false and misleading statements relating to the Company s projected performance that had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of its securities.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P69_S3	These actions were consolidated in December 2007 under docket number 07-4215, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on March 7, 2008 that raised the same claims but alleged a class period of February 14, 2007 through February 19, 2008.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P69_S4	The consolidated amended complaint asked the court to (1) certify a class, (2) award compensatory damages, reasonable costs and expenses and (3) grant such other and further relief as the court deemed just and proper.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P69_S5	The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 6, 2008 that was granted by the Court on August 31, 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P69_S6	On September 29, 2009, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on May 19, 2010, upon motion by the plaintiff/appellant, the appeal was dismissed with prejudice without costs to either party.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S0	On April 27, 2010, counsel for a stockholder sent a letter relating to the same events that formed the bases of the federal putative class action described above.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S1	Specifically, the stockholder has demanded, pursuant to Delaware Chancery Court Rule 23.1, that the Board of Directors (1) undertake (or cause to be undertaken) an independent internal investigation into violations of Delaware law committed by Company management during the time periods described above and (2) commence a civil action against each member of management to recover for the benefit of the Company the amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of their breaches of fiduciary duties described above.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S2	The Board of Directors appointed a special committee consisting of three independent directors to investigate this demand.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S3	The special committee engaged independent legal counsel to assist it in this investigation.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S4	In April 2011, the special committee, with the assistance of independent legal counsel, completed its investigation and delivered to the Board of Directors the special committee s recommendation that the Company refuse the demands made in the stockholder s letter.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S5	At its April 2011 meeting, the Board of Directors, after deliberation and discussion, unanimously determined to accept the special committee s recommendation as in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S6	Promptly thereafter, the special committee s counsel delivered to the stockholder s counsel a letter informing counsel of the Board of Directors actions and the Company s decision to refuse the stockholder s demands.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S7	In May 2011, the stockholder s counsel sent a letter to the Company s counsel demanding to inspect and make copies of certain specified books, records, minutes and other documents of the Company for the purposes set forth in such letter.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S8	Without waiving any of its rights to challenge the propriety of such purposes under Delaware law, in early June 2011, the Company delivered to the stockholder s counsel copies of certain minutes of the Board of Directors and the special committee according to the terms of a confidentiality agreement that the Company and the stockholder had executed.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P70_S9	The Company has not received any further correspondence or communications from the stockholder or his counsel since that time.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P71_S0	On August 5, 2011, a lawsuit was filed by a stockholder in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc., certain of its officers and directors, and one of its former officers as defendants and alleging breaches by defendants of their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith and loyalty, unjust enrichment, and aiding and abetting from 2010 to the present in connection with the award of excessive and unwarranted 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P71_S1	Plaintiff specifically claims the action to be a failed say-on-pay shareholder derivative action stemming from the advisory, non-binding vote of the Company s stockholders at its May 12, 2011 annual meeting in which the Company s stockholders did not approve the Company s 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P72_S0	certain false and misleading statements contained in Nutrisystem s Proxy Statement; (2) the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Board of Directors compensation practices; (3) the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s failure to respond to the negative say-on-pay vote; and (4) as a result of the foregoing the defendants were unjustly enriched at the expense of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P72_S1	Accordingly, the complaint asks the court to (1) award judgment against the defendants and in favor of the Company for an unspecified amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of defendants violation of state law, (2) grant extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief as necessary or permitted by law, equity and the statutory provisions cited in the complaint, including disgorgement, attachment, impoundment, imposition of a constructive trust on or otherwise restricting the disposition/exercise of improvidently awarded executive compensation based upon false financial reporting and/or the proceeds of defendants trading activities or their other assets so as to ensure that plaintiff on behalf of the Company has an effective remedy; (3) order the implementation and administration of internal controls and systems at the Company designed to prohibit and prevent excessive and/or unwarranted executive compensation payments to the Company s chief executive, chief financial, and other senior executive officers; (4) award to plaintiff the costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys fees, and accountants and expert fees, costs and expenses; and (5) grant such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P73_S0	On October 21, 2011 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for failure to adequately plead demand futility.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P73_S1	On November 21, 2011 plaintiff filed his brief in opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint and alleged that the directors issued false and misleading statements in the Company s proxy statement by stating that the Company adhered to a pay-for-performance policy when in fact it did not.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P73_S2	In its opposition brief, plaintiff abandoned the count contained in its complaint that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s failure to respond to the negative say-on-pay vote.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P73_S3	On December 5, 2011 defendants filed their reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss the complaint.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P73_S4	The court has scheduled a preliminary pretrial conference for March 8, 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P73_S5	The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P74_S0	On September 1, 2011, a lawsuit was filed by another stockholder in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc., certain of its officers and directors, and one of its former officers as defendants and alleging breaches by defendants of their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith and loyalty, unjust enrichment, and aiding and abetting from 2010 to the present in connection with the award of excessive and unwarranted 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P74_S1	This action stems from the same failed say-on-pay advisory, non-binding vote of the Company s stockholders at its May 12, 2011 annual meeting in which the Company s stockholders did not approve the Company s 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P74_S2	The complaint is listed under docket number 2011-24985 and specifically alleges that (1) the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of certain materially false and misleading statements and omissions of fact in Nutrisystem s Proxy Statement; (2) the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s excessive 2010 executive compensation and the failure to rescind such compensation in response to the negative say-on-pay vote; and (3) as a result of the foregoing the executive defendants were unjustly enriched at the expense of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P74_S3	Accordingly, the complaint asks the court to (1) determine that the action is a proper derivative action maintainable under the law and that demand is excused; (2) award judgment against the defendants and in favor of the Company for an unspecified amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of defendants breaches of fiduciary duties; (3) grant injunctive and other equitable relief as necessary or permitted by law, equity and the statutory provisions cited in the complaint, including disgorgement, attachment, impoundment, imposition of a constructive trust on or otherwise restricting the disposition/exercise of disloyally awarded 2010 executive compensation; (4) direct the Company to take all necessary actions to reform and improve its corporate governance and internal procedures to comply with all applicable laws and to protect the Company and its stockholders from a repeat of the damaging events described in the Complaint; (5) award to plaintiff the costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable allowance of fees and costs for plaintiff s attorneys, experts and accountants; and (6) grant such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P75_S0	of Civil Procedure 1028(a)(1) and (a)(4) under Pennsylvania s internal affairs doctrine; (2) failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1028(a)(4); and (3) lack of capacity to sue under Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 1028(a)(5) because the plaintiff did not make a demand on the Company s directors and failed to adequately allege that such demand was excused.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S0	On November 21, 2011, defendants filed a praecipe for argument in which they requested oral argument.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S1	On December 23, 2011, plaintiff filed his opposition to the defendants preliminary objections and alleged that the directors issued false and misleading statements in the Company s proxy statement by stating that the Company adhered to a pay-for-performance policy when in fact it did not.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S2	On January 23, 2012, defendants filed their reply brief in support of their preliminary objections to the complaint.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S3	Oral argument was heard by the court on February 8, 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S4	On February 13, 2012, the court denied the defendants preliminary objections.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S5	The defendants answer to the complaint is now required to be filed by March 13, 2012.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S6	The Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to defend the litigation vigorously.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S7	The Company is also involved in other various claims and routine litigation matters.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P76_S8	In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future years.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P77_S0	The Company has entered into supply agreements with various food vendors.

1096376_12_ITEM15_P82_S1	Unless otherwise required by law, the Board of Directors can, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock in the future with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the common stock.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P83_S0	The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, averting or preventing a change in control of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P83_S1	The provision for income taxes from continuing operations consists of the following: The income tax benefit attributable to discontinued operation consists of the following:
1096376_12_ITEM15_P84_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows: The change in the effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011 was due to the impact of limitations on executive compensation deductions and food donations in comparison to pre-tax income as well as reductions in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations during the fourth quarter of 2011 and tax credits and other miscellaneous adjustments occurring throughout the year.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P85_S0	The significant items comprising the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1096376_12_ITEM15_P86_S0	At December 31, 2011, the net deferred tax asset of $3,039 is comprised of $1,584 included in current assets and $1,455 included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P86_S1	At December 31, 2010, the net deferred tax asset of $2,655 is comprised of $1,854 included in current assets and $801 included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P86_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $12,832 and $13,716, respectively, for state tax purposes.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P86_S3	The decrease is due to the utilization of net operating losses.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P86_S4	For state tax purposes, there is a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in a given year to offset state taxable income.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P86_S5	Net operating losses will begin to expire in 2024.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P86_S6	Based on the projected level of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the net deferred tax assets.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P87_S0	In 2008, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $3,749 related to its impairment of its investment in Zero Water since the character of the deduction could be a capital item and there was no history of generating capital gains.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P87_S1	In 2009, the Company abandoned its investment in Zero Water (see Note 7) which provided the Company with a current year income tax deduction for its entire original $14,258 tax basis investment in Zero Water.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P87_S2	This reduced 2009 federal income tax payments by approximately $4,990.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S0	ended December 31, 2009 including a reversal of a $3,749 valuation allowance established in 2008 for deferred tax assets related to prior Zero Water losses and impairment charges.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S1	These Zero Water losses and impairment charges were considered realizable during the year ended December 31, 2009 due to the terms of the abandonment which changed the tax loss from capital to ordinary which the Company believes is more likely than not to realize.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S2	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $1,919 and $2,478, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S3	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is approximately $1,247 and $1,611, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S4	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S5	During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized $133, $99 and $70, respectively, in interest and penalties.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S6	The Company s federal income tax returns for 2008 through 2011 are open and are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S7	State tax jurisdictions that remain open to examination range from 2000 through 2011.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S8	The Company does not believe that that there will be any material changes to unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P88_S9	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the total unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:
1096376_12_ITEM15_P89_S0	LLC ( Slim and Tone ) and this subsidiary has been treated as a discontinued operation.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P89_S1	Accordingly, the operating results of this discontinued operation have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P89_S2	The plan to sell was not completed and operations ceased as of December 31, 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P89_S3	Slim and Tone had revenues of $65 and pre-tax losses of $390 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P90_S0	In the first quarter of 2010, the Company committed to a plan to sell the business operations conducted by NuKitchen, as it was no longer aligned with the business direction of the Company.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P90_S1	The Company was unsuccessful in locating a buyer for the NuKitchen business and, therefore, it closed the business during 2010.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P90_S2	NuKitchen has been treated as a discontinued operation.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P90_S3	Accordingly, the operating results of this discontinued operation have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P91_S0	NuKitchen had revenues of $1,707 and $3,113 and pre-tax losses of $808 and $6,091 (including impairment charge) for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P92_S0	Equity Incentive Plans The Company had three equity incentive plans: the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the Equity Incentive Plans ).
1096376_12_ITEM15_P92_S1	The 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan is currently the only plan under which new awards may be granted.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P92_S2	Under that plan, a variety of equity instruments can be granted to key employees including incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units or shares of common stock.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S0	authorize up to 1,000,000, 5,600,000 and 2,700,000 shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S1	At December 31, 2011, the 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan had 500,039 shares available for grant.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S2	Under each of the plans, the Board of Directors determines the term of each award, but no award can be exercisable more than 10 years from the date the award is granted.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S3	To date, all of the awards issued under the Equity Incentive Plans expire 10 years from the grant date.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S4	The Board also determines the vesting provisions and the exercise price per share, which is the fair market value at date of grant.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S5	Awards issued to employees generally vest over terms ranging from three to five years.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S6	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity for 2009, 2010 and 2011: In 2011, the Company recorded pre-tax compensation charges of $150 for stock option awards.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S7	In 2010 and 2009, the Company did not record any compensation charges for stock option awards as all outstanding awards were fully vested.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S8	There were no option grants in 2010 or 2009.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S9	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 2011 was $4.50.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S10	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $204, $1,001 and $1,352, respectively.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S11	The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions: In 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company authorized the issuance of 30,275, 19,124 and 30,618 shares of common stock, respectively, as compensation to the Board of Directors resulting in compensation expense of $455 in each year.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S12	In addition, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company issued a total of 124,561, 11,576, and 8,421 shares of common stock, respectively, to non-employees for services.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S13	Costs recognized for these shares were $841, $167 and $83 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and approximated fair value.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P93_S14	The stock-based compensation costs were recorded in marketing and general and administrative expenses in 2011, 2010, and 2009 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company has issued restricted stock to employees generally with vesting terms ranging from three to five years.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P94_S1	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P95_S0	Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P95_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for 2009, 2010 and 2011: Additionally, the Company grants restricted stock units.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P95_S2	The restricted stock units granted during 2010 and 2011 were primarily performance-based units.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P95_S3	The performance-based units have performance conditions and graded-vesting.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P95_S4	Each vesting tranche is treated as an individual award and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P95_S5	The requisite service period is a combination of the performance period and the subsequent vesting period based on continued service.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P95_S6	The level of achievement of such goals may cause the actual amount of units that ultimately vest to range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted which is reflected as performance factor adjustment in the table below.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P96_S0	The Company recognizes expense for performance-based restricted stock units when it is probable that the performance criteria specified will be achieved.
1096376_12_ITEM15_P97_S0	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.

1096376_13_ITEM1_P0_S0	Nutrisystem, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Nutrisystem, the Company, we, us, or our ) is a leading provider of a weight management system based on a low-calorie, portion-controlled, prepared meal program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages containing a 28-day supply of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts, which they supplement with dairy, fruit, salad, vegetables and low-glycemic carbohydrate items.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	Most of our customers order on an auto-delivery basis ( Auto-Delivery ), in which we send a month s food supply on an ongoing basis until notified by the customer to stop our shipments.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P0_S3	We offer personalized plans where customers can hand pick their entire menu or go with our pre-selected favorites pack.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P0_S4	Our Basic Plan contains the pre-selected favorites pack while our Core Plan allows customers the ability to customize their menu and provides access to trained counselors.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P0_S5	All foods for the Basic and Core programs are shelf-stable at room temperature and will last for up to two years, making the packages relatively inexpensive to ship and store.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P0_S6	Our Select program includes a fully customizable combination of the ready-to-go food as well as our frozen line of menu items and access to trained counselors.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our program is based on the following cornerstones that represent who we are to our customers: Results.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P1_S1	We believe our program enables our customers to lose weight successfully.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Nutrisystem program is based on 40 years of nutrition research and the science of the low Glycemic Index, and offers over 150 portion-controlled items that include relatively higher amounts of fiber, contain good carbohydrates and zero trans fats.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Foods on the lower end of the Glycemic Index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P3_S2	We also offer transition and maintenance plans, which include support tools and desired meal occasions that customers wish to continue to receive from Nutrisystem.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P3_S3	These plans are designed to help our customers keep the weight off.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	We sell our weight management program primarily through a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution approach using the Internet and telephone.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our customers can order 24 hours a day, seven days a week on our website, www.nutrisystem.com , and the food is shipped directly to the customer s door.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting of a pre-packaged food program and counseling.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our customers can either choose our pre-selected favorites food package or customize their monthly food orders for their specific tastes.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P4_S4	Our program does not require customers to visit centers, measure foods or count calories.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P4_S5	The entrees are individually packaged and food preparation time is minimal.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	We do not charge membership fees.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	Additionally, we advertise various promotional offers and pricing throughout the year.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet and telephone provides the privacy that our customers value.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	We provide online and telephone counseling and support to our customers using our trained weight loss coaches, diet counselors and other nutrition and dietary staff, and thus, our customers do not need to travel for a face-to-face meeting.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Competitive Strengths We believe our program offers consumers a sensible approach to losing weight without the use of faddish, unhealthy or unrealistic weight loss methods.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths to grow: Product Efficacy .
1096376_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using our program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	2.0 pounds per week and tended to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	We believe these surveys indicate overall satisfaction with our program and a potential willingness to refer our program to others.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	We have also sponsored clinical trials at leading academic centers in patients with type 2 diabetes.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	Statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in glycemic control were observed, in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe that our brand is well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our company and our predecessors have been in the weight management industry for 40 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we generate revenue in our direct channel through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards).
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	We also minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment: we outsource the production of our food products to a number of vendors and we outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations to a third party provider.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight management program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S4	Our customers place their orders through the Internet or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their homes.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S5	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets, which rely on weight-loss centers, cannot ensure.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S6	Additionally, we provide our customers with a month of food, including daily breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert, which removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S7	We believe our weight management program offers our customers significant value and is priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P10_S8	In addition, we do not charge a membership fee, whereas many of our competitors do.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S., as well as the global population.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	The 2009-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Study estimated that over 78 million U.S. adults were obese in 2009-2010 and the World Health Organization projects that by 2015, 2.3 billion people will be overweight and 700 million of these will be obese.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Obesity is increasingly prevalent in children and studies have shown for the first time significant emergence of diseases such as type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our clinical trial results and analyses of real world customer results confirm that people who stay on the Nutrisystem program for at least three months have a very high probability of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition to the health risks, there are also cultural implications for those who are overweight or obese.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	U.S. consumers are inundated with imagery in media, fashion and entertainment that depicts the thin body as the ideal body type.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	Studies suggest that there is rampant discrimination against the obese.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	Despite the high percentage of overweight and obese individuals in the U.S., the popularity of dieting appears to indicate consumers desire to be thin.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	Competition The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and other medically supervised programs.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our identified peers and competitors include, but are not limited to, eDiets.com, Jenny Craig, Medifast, Inc. and Weight Watchers International, Inc.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P16_S4	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight management industry.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	By providing a well-recognized food-based program using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P17_S4	Our Products and Services For 40 years, the Nutrisystem name has been recognized as a leader in the weight loss industry.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P17_S5	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting primarily of a pre-packaged food program, online tools and counseling.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P17_S6	Trained counselors are available to answer questions and make recommendations to help each customer achieve and maintain his or her weight loss goal.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Customers support and encourage each other and share information through hosted Internet chat rooms and bulletin boards.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	These services are complemented with relevant information on diet, nutrition and physical activity, which is provided on our community website and emailed to our customers bi-weekly.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	Additionally, online and smart phone weight management tools are available to our customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	These tools include the interactive Mindset Makeover guide, a behavior modification program that was co-authored by an international leader in the field of obesity research and is offered to our customers free of charge.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P18_S4	This insightful and motivational guide walks customers through the program and can serve as an interactive tool for our counselors to use to facilitate communication and enhance weight loss success for our customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	Our Nutrisystem program consists of over 150 portion-controlled items that serve as the foundation of a low Glycemic Index diet.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods and foods on the lower end of the index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our program is portioned for weight loss and offers a balance of carbohydrate, protein and fat that meets national dietary guidelines.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have also worked to reduce the sodium content of our meal program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Including grocery additions to supplement our meals, our plans contain 1800-2200 milligrams of sodium per day, consistent with national guidelines, and tailored versions of the plans are available that deliver as low as 1500 mg/day.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	In contrast, the average American consumes 2800-4000 milligrams of sodium per day.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P20_S5	We constantly strive to meet or exceed nutritional guidelines as they are updated.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P20_S6	In December 2011, we launched SUCCESS, our most comprehensive program to date.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The SUCCESS program offers our largest ever assortment of signature frozen meals including artisanal Chef s Table dinner entrees; chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and coffee advanced protein shakes; the introduction of a personalized My Daily 3 physical activity program; and increased personalization and flexibility through transition and maintenance plans that help customers manage their weight on their own.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Our Nutrisystem Select program incorporates both our ready-to-go and frozen foods to enhance Nutrisystem s tradition of effective weight loss and weight management.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	Most of our weight plans offer these frozen foods.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	The program provides customers with premium frozen foods that complement Nutrisystem s prepared food weight loss programs and still adheres to Nutrisystem s nutritional guidelines.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	When a customer orders Nutrisystem Select, two separate shipments are delivered directly to the customer s home.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P22_S1	The first shipment will contain Nutrisystem s standard ready-to-go food and the second shipment will contain the frozen foods.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Nutrisystem D Program is a weight loss program specifically designed to produce gradual weight loss in overweight patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	Results from a 2009 clinical study conducted at the Temple University School of Medicine and published in the journal Postgraduate Medicine show that the Nutrisystem D Program, in combination with weekly counseling sessions, helped overweight individuals with type 2 diabetes lose more weight and experience greater reductions in their A1C levels (a key measure of blood glucose control) as compared to those in the control group.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	This weight loss was also associated with reductions in blood pressure, cholesterol and waist circumference.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	A follow up study at the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University School of Medicine was completed in July 2011 and initial findings were presented at the Obesity Society s annual conference in October 2011, confirming and extending the key findings of the first diabetes trial.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S4	In addition, the subjects randomized to Nutrisystem D achieved a significant reduction in the requirement for diabetes medications relative to the control group.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S5	A third trial in type 2 diabetes employed continuous glucose monitoring to determine the effect of Nutrisystem D versus a self-selected diet on blood glucose levels and variability in the first two weeks of use.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S6	The study, conducted at the University of Pennsylvania, found that Nutrisystem D resulted in lower mean blood glucose and decreased variability in blood glucose.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P23_S7	The decreased variability was due to a decrease in the incidence of high blood glucose, with no significant increase in low blood glucose.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Multiple trials involving the other Nutrisystem programs are recently completed or ongoing.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	One of these, conducted at Florida State University, looked at weight loss, changes in body composition and changes in cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women randomized to receive the Nutrisystem D Program alone, low intensity resistance exercise alone, or the combination, for 12 weeks.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Key findings were presented at the 2012 annual conference of the American College of Sport Medicine.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Nutrisystem D Program, alone or with exercise, resulted in weight loss, smaller waist circumference, decreased body fat, improved arterial elasticity and improved cardiac perfusion.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	Several of these trials have received third party funding, with Nutrisystem s financial contribution limited to the provision of program food.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	In May 2012, we introduced a new in-store retail line, Nutrisystem Everyday , comprised of nutritionally balanced bars, smoothies and bakery and breakfast items targeted to consumers who aspire to eat healthier.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	During 2013, we will be refining the products and distribution channels for the retail line.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P26_S2	Also, we continue to offer our program at Costco through the use of prepaid program cards and gift cards.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Nutrisystem program has also been offered at other large retailers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	We are continually exploring other major retailers where we may potentially offer our program in the future.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages of ready-to-go and frozen food containing 28 days of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and desserts, which they supplement with dairy, fruit, salad, vegetables and low-glycemic carbohydrate items.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	In certain instances, depending on the promotional offers available, customers can receive more than the typical 28 days of food.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	Most customers order through our Auto-Delivery feature.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	By offering a variety of ready-to-go and frozen foods, we help our customers sustain their weight loss efforts.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	On our website, customers can order food 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	These lower cost programs help extend the supportive relationship and allow time to reinforce the dietary changes that produced the initial weight loss.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	These plans include recipes and portion-control tools in addition to a reduced number of Nutrisystem entrees delivered each month.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The features of our weight loss program address many of the most common limitations of traditional weight loss programs, including high initiation and recurring membership fees, the inconvenience of traveling to weight loss centers for scheduled appointments and lack of privacy.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	In addition, our prepared meals provide our customers with a structured program with limited weighing and measuring of foods and no need to count calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	We believe that the convenience of home delivery, reduced grocery shopping time and rapid food preparation also aid customer compliance with our weight loss program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Our food items have accounted for 99% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P32_S1	No other product or service has accounted for more than 1% of our revenue in any of the last three years.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P32_S2	In 2012, 100% of our revenues were generated in the United States.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P32_S3	Approximately 99% and 98% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were generated in the United States.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	Marketing Marketing is a core competency that drives sales and builds the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	We have strong expertise in all facets of both offline and online marketing and utilize an integrated marketing process designed to drive profitable revenue in an efficient, effective way.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	We believe Nutrisystem is one of the leading and most efficient offline direct response advertisers in the industry.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	We deploy a hybrid of proven direct response techniques to: 1) build brand equity and awareness; 2) encourage qualified customers to call or visit our website; and 3) deliver profitable sales.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P33_S4	We track response to each advertisement through unique toll-free numbers and URLs and we deploy multi-channel campaigns to target potential new customers that include television, print, direct mail and telemarketing efforts.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P33_S5	To reactivate lapsed customers and upsell to those already on our program, we utilize a combination of direct mail and telemarketing efforts which complements our other media advertising.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	Our online marketing strategy focuses on driving high-volume, cost-effective, qualified leads to our website with an emphasis on increasing both front-end and back-end conversion through constant testing and optimization.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	We are continually exploring new online opportunities as the market evolves, but focus the majority of our efforts on search optimization (paid and natural), affiliate management, portal relationships, large ad networks, strategic partnerships, targeted display media and internal/external email campaigns.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The consumer and business media outreach programs accentuate Nutrisystem as a leader and innovator in the weight loss category.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Our public relations strategically complement offline and online marketing to increase top-of-mind awareness for Nutrisystem, as well as to foster positive word-of-mouth, in order to enhance purchase consideration of our product.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	News, Entertainment Tonight and Forbes.com .
1096376_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	We typically compensate our celebrity third-party marketing vendors based on the initial weight loss of the particular spokesperson on our program and maintenance of the weight loss over time.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	In addition to traditional public relations, we seek to leverage social media platforms such as Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest, YouTube , blogs and our own active online community to engage potential customers; acquire new customers and leads; listen and learn from our customers, as well as those who do not become a customer; and motivate those on-program to greater success.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	Overall, we seek to create true believers who will provide social proof to others of the effectiveness of our program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	Ecommerce As a leading ecommerce company and brand, we constantly strive to employ the latest tools and technology in order to drive increased performance of online customer conversion, retention and reactivation.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	We utilize our ecommerce platform to drive a highly-customizable and personalized user experience, as well as to effectively and efficiently manage day-to-day ecommerce business operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	In addition, we combine internal resources with external agencies in the development of our website information architecture, user interface and user experience.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	In order to optimize the key online business drivers, we continually perform usability testing and are constantly optimizing our website using a variety of sophisticated third party testing tools.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	Finally, we measure our online interaction with customers, along with broader website performance, via web analytics platforms and tools.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Sales and Counseling A majority of our direct business sales occur on our website.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	The remaining sales are by telephone, and our call center processes all of them.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	Our weight loss program is also sold through QVC, a television home shopping network and, in 2012, we introduced a new in-store retail line.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P38_S3	As of December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 68 weight loss counselors and 159 sales agents.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P38_S4	Staffing levels for counselors and sales agents are largely a function of the volume of revenue and orders.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	Sales agents are responsible for in-bound sales calls and will initiate out-bound sales calls to our leads and other targeted potential customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	Additionally, certain sales agents assist in retaining customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	Counselors initiate some out-bound sales calls but primarily focus on in-bound calls and email.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	Counselors also handle online web conversations from new visitors and appointments with existing customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	Sales agents are paid primarily on commission while counselors receive an hourly wage.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S5	We seek to hire counselors with backgrounds in psychology, sociology, nutrition, dietetics or other health-related fields and with suitable temperaments to speak with our customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S6	Counselors are trained in our program, our Internet chat service, email, motivational techniques and customer service problem solving.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S7	Sales agents are well-versed in explaining our program and working with our customers to determine the program that would best fit their needs in helping them reach their weight loss goals.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S8	Customer Service As of December 31, 2012, we employed approximately 77 customer service representatives.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S9	Customer service representatives are trained to handle in-bound calls and emails from customers who have questions or problems with an order after the sale transaction is completed.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S10	Typical customer inquiries relate to the arrival date of the customer s order shipment, reporting of missing or damaged items and credits and exchanges.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P39_S11	For email inquiries, we have a software system that scans the customer s email message for key words and automatically supplies the representative with a form response that is reviewed, edited and sent back to the customer.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Customer service representatives are paid an hourly wage.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Fulfillment An integrated order receipt, billing, picking, shipping and delivery tracking system comprised of proprietary and third party components is utilized for our orders.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	This system integrates the front end, or website customer interface, with order processing and shipping, and allows customers to access shippers order tracking numbers online.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	Our computer-assisted picking system allows for virtually paperless order picking in all warehouse facilities.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	In 2012, we expanded our capabilities to support the distribution of products to multiple retailers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	We utilize an integrated network of distribution facilities through an existing arrangement with our outside fulfillment provider.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Over the past several years, these initiatives resulted in realized cost improvements, enhanced vendor productivity and warehouse efficiencies and helped increase our perfect order index which is a key metric supporting customer satisfaction and quality.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	In addition, these initiatives resulted in improved inventory management and allowed us to reduce our overall warehouse footprint.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	We currently utilize five outsourced distribution facilities located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Edwardsville, Illinois and two in Sparks, Nevada.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	As of December 31, 2012, all fulfillment was being handled by one outsourced provider.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P42_S4	We have a service agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, which provides for storage, handling of frozen and ready-to-go foods and other services, including pricing and minimum space commitments.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P42_S5	The current contract expires on April 30, 2015, but may be terminated sooner upon 180 days written notice.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	We believe that other outside fulfillment providers could be utilized if needed and we continually evaluate the need for secondary fulfillment services.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	We continue to partner with our fulfillment provider to reduce the warehouse order turn-around time for processing and shipping orders.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	In 2012, approximately 99% of all direct customer initial orders were shipped within three business days of the date the order was received.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	In addition, we can deliver to approximately 99% of the domestic population within five business days using standard ground transportation.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Direct customers are not charged for their orders until the ordered product is shipped.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	We do not charge customers for shipping and handling on Auto-Delivery food orders provided customers take receipt of their second order.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P44_S2	If a customer cancels before receipt of a second order, the customer will be charged for shipping and the difference in pricing for an Auto-Delivery order versus a non Auto-Delivery order.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	All of our foods and supplements are currently outsourced from more than 30 manufacturers or vendors.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	We have entered into supply agreements with some of these food vendors.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S2	The majority of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S3	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S4	All of these contracts may be terminated by us upon written notice, generally between 30 and 180 days.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S5	We anticipate meeting all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S6	In 2012, approximately 17% and 13%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S7	We have a supply arrangement with one of these vendors that requires us to make certain minimum purchases.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S8	In 2011, these vendors supplied approximately 16% and 15%, respectively, of inventory purchases and in 2010, approximately 17% and 18%, respectively, of inventory purchases.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S9	Additionally, we were dependent on one frozen food supplier for less than 20% of our food costs in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S10	We had a supply agreement with this supplier that expired in November 2011, and we have found other frozen food supply options to replace this supplier.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P45_S11	The amount provided from this supplier in 2010 was negligible.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our product development team uses a number of sources customer feedback, market trends, nutrition science, and breakthroughs in food technology to create new ideas for our program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	New foods are created to enhance the variety of our current offerings or to support the efforts of creating a new program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	Typically, concepts are formulated in the test kitchen to meet our stringent demands for nutrition and stability.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	We then contract with food manufacturers who further develop viable new products based on our specifications.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P46_S4	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste (using testing panels), and cost considerations.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our Customers We offer weight loss programs designed for women, men, seniors as well as people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	Based on our customer data, our typical customer is female, approximately 50 years of age and weighs approximately 187 pounds.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	We believe that, on average, our customers want to lose approximately 43 pounds over a period of time.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	Based on our customer surveys, we believe our typical customers tend to stay on our program for 11 to 12 weeks, lose 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and have tried other popular diet programs.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P48_S4	We believe that these surveys indicate a willingness to refer our program to others and that our customers value the following Nutrisystem program attributes:
1096376_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	they do not feel hungry while on the program.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our ecommerce and community websites, both of which are based primarily on third party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in a top tier, co-location facility.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	These facilities provide redundant network connections, physical and fire security and diesel generated power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely and are intended to provide an uninterruptible power supply.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P50_S3	We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P50_S4	When our customers place an order or access their account information, we secure that transaction by using some of the best available encryption technologies, including secure sockets layer, or SSL.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P50_S5	Our customer data is protected against unauthorized access by security measures and we engage a variety of industry leading technology providers including VeriSign, CyberSource and SecureWorks to further ensure the security of our credit card transactions and the safety of our customers personal information.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P50_S6	We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 398 administrative, sales, counseling and customer service personnel, 21 employees dedicated to fulfillment and 47 employees in marketing.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

1096376_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	Following the sale of QSP, Inc. in 2012, Ms. Krausz became head of new business development for Animated Storyboards, a global independent provider of television test spots to the advertising industry.
1096376_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	Ms. Krausz started her career at Reader s Digest Association in 1992, and held a number of progressively-responsible positions in product management, marketing, and business management, ultimately ascending to Vice President, Marketing and General Manager, of Reader s Digest Association s Books Music Business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our marketing expenditures were $111.1 million, $110.9 million and $145.9 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our program which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment, Internet, networking and call center services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We rely solely on third party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In 2012, approximately 17% and 13%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P2_S9	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food and other products in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	In 2012, more than 90% of our orders were shipped by one third party provider and 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by one third party provider.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Internet, Networking and Call Center .
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access, networking and call center services, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Further, if our website or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brand and loss of sales.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Therefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) or United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Some of our counselors for our weight management program do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields and have only undergone the training they receive from us.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Our weight loss program does not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S9	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management program.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S10	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S11	Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S12	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S13	If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S14	Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P5_S15	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management program.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S6	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are dependent on certain third party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third party retailers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products and services are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Additionally, some agreements contain exclusive rights in specified locations to promote our products during the contract term and for a specified period thereafter.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If any third party elects not to renew their agreement or reduces the promotion of our products, our revenues will suffer.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in competitive advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our program.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P8_S5	While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our website.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Additional states and governmental entities are considering such notice laws.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our website or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our website or purchasing our services or products.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We rely on third party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Our business is seasonal, with revenues generally stronger in the first quarter and weaker in the fourth quarter.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S10	The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S11	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Future acquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S13	A component of our growth strategy may be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and services.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Even if we succeed in acquiring or building such businesses, we will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If our brand suffers or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We use third-party marketing vendors to promote our products.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight management program.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Third parties may infringe on our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S7	If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S10	In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S11	We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S12	We may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S13	Third parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S14	Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S15	In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S16	If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P13_S17	Any of these results could reduce our revenues and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our credit agreement contains financial and other covenants.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a minimum consolidated liquidity ratio, and includes limitations on, among other things, capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, acquisitions, stock repurchases and restrictions on paying dividends in certain circumstances.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement may result in an event of default under the agreement.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S7	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S8	We have not obtained life insurance on any key executive officers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S9	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Risks Related to Our Industry Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our program features pre-packaged food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our pre-packaged food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S9	If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	More recently, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity, and restrictions of our business operations.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	We continue to be subject to such a consent decree, which, in part, restricts how we advertise the successes our customers have achieved in losing weight through the program and require us to include the phrase results not typical.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	In October 2009, the FTC published its revised Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising which now requires us to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our program when using a customer s weight loss testimonial in advertising.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P22_S2	For example, the labeling and distribution of food products are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and remain unsettled.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, vitamins, nutritional supplements and minerals, including our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenues and profits.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	lease one location in Horsham, Pennsylvania and one in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	These two locations total approximately 171,157 square feet of office space.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S2	The lease in Horsham expires in 2018.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S3	The lease for our Fort Washington location expires in 2022.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S4	In 2012, we entered into a lease for an additional office location in Hoboken, New Jersey.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S5	The lease is for approximately 1,665 square feet of office space and expires in 2014.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S6	We have additional fulfillment capacity in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Edwardsville, Illinois and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S7	We have no lease obligations to any of our outsourced fulfillment providers; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.
1096376_13_ITEM2_P0_S8	Management believes the outsourced fulfillment capacity is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	On August 4, 2011, a lawsuit was filed by a stockholder in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc., certain of its officers and directors, and one of its former officers as defendants and alleging breaches by defendants of their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith and loyalty, unjust enrichment, and aiding and abetting from 2010 to the present in connection with the award of allegedly excessive and unwarranted 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	Plaintiff specifically claimed the action to be a failed say-on-pay shareholder derivative action stemming from the advisory, non-binding vote of the Company s stockholders at its May 12, 2011 annual meeting in which the Company s stockholders did not approve the Company s 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P0_S2	The complaint is listed under docket number 2:11-cv-05036-PD and specifically alleged that (1) defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of certain false and misleading statements contained in Nutrisystem s Proxy Statement; (2) defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Board of Directors compensation practices; (3) defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s failure to respond to the negative say-on-pay vote; and (4) as a result of the foregoing defendants were unjustly enriched at the expense of the Company.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P0_S3	Accordingly, the complaint asked the court to (1) award judgment against defendants and in favor of the Company for an unspecified amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of defendants violation of state law, (2) grant extraordinary equitable and/or injunctive relief as necessary or permitted by law, equity and the statutory provisions cited in the complaint, including disgorgement, attachment, impoundment, imposition of a constructive trust on or otherwise restricting the disposition/exercise of improvidently awarded executive compensation based upon false financial reporting and/or the proceeds of defendants trading activities or their other assets so as to ensure that plaintiff on behalf of the Company has an effective remedy; (3) order the implementation and administration of internal controls and systems at the Company designed to prohibit and prevent excessive and/or unwarranted executive compensation payments to the Company s chief executive, chief financial, and other senior executive officers; (4) award to plaintiff the costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable attorneys fees, and accountants and expert fees, costs and expenses; and (5) grant such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	On October 21, 2011, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(6) and 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for failure to adequately plead demand futility.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	On November 21, 2011, plaintiff filed his brief in opposition to defendants motion to dismiss the complaint and alleged that the directors issued false and misleading statements in the Company s proxy statement by stating that the Company adhered to a pay-for-performance policy when in fact it did not.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	In its opposition brief, plaintiff abandoned the count contained in its complaint that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s failure to respond to the negative say-on-pay vote.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	On December 5, 2011, defendants filed their reply brief in support of their motion to dismiss the complaint.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	On March 8, 2012, the court held a preliminary pretrial conference, and on May 16, 2012, the court held a settlement conference.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	Although the Company believed that the claims were without merit, on September 5, 2012 plaintiff, defendants and the plaintiff in the related state court lawsuit discussed in the following paragraph entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement with respect to all of the claims at issue under the respective lawsuits, and on September 13, 2012, the court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S6	On November 15, 2012, the court held a hearing on the final approval of the settlement, and on December 12, 2012, the court issued a final order and judgment approving the settlement.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P1_S7	The Company s entire exposure for these matters has been expensed as of December 31, 2012.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	On September 1, 2011, a lawsuit was filed by another stockholder in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania naming Nutrisystem, Inc., certain of its officers and directors, and one of its former officers as defendants and alleging breaches by defendants of their fiduciary duties of care, candor, good faith and loyalty, unjust enrichment, and aiding and abetting from 2010 to the present in connection with the award of excessive and unwarranted 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P2_S1	This action stemmed from the same failed say-on-pay advisory, non-binding vote of the Company s stockholders at its May 12, 2011 annual meeting in which the Company s stockholders did not approve the Company s 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	is listed under docket number 2011-24985-0 and specifically alleged that (1) defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of certain materially false and misleading statements and omissions of fact in Nutrisystem s Proxy Statement; (2) defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Company s allegedly excessive 2010 executive compensation and the failure to rescind such compensation in response to the negative say-on-pay vote; and (3) as a result of the foregoing the executive defendants were unjustly enriched at the expense of the Company.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	Accordingly, the complaint asked the court to (1) determine that the action was a proper derivative action maintainable under the law and that demand was excused; (2) award judgment against defendants and in favor of the Company for an unspecified amount of damages sustained by the Company as a result of defendants breaches of fiduciary duties; (3) grant injunctive and other equitable relief as necessary or permitted by law, equity and the statutory provisions cited in the complaint, including disgorgement, attachment, impoundment, imposition of a constructive trust on or otherwise restricting the disposition/exercise of disloyally awarded 2010 executive compensation; (4) direct the Company to take all necessary actions to reform and improve its corporate governance and internal procedures to comply with all applicable laws and to protect the Company and its stockholders from a repeat of the allegedly damaging events described in the Complaint; (5) award to plaintiff the costs and disbursements of the action, including reasonable allowance of fees and costs for plaintiff s attorneys, experts and accountants; and (6) grant such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P4_S0	Plaintiff participated in the settlement conference on May 16, 2012 in connection with the lawsuit described in the preceding paragraph that was filed by another stockholder in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania stemming from the same failed say-on-pay advisory, non-binding vote of the Company s stockholders at its May 12, 2011 annual meeting in which the Company s stockholders did not approve the Company s 2010 executive compensation.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P4_S1	Although the Company believed that the claims were without merit, on September 5, 2012 plaintiff, defendants and the plaintiff in the related federal court lawsuit discussed in the preceding paragraph entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement with respect to all of the claims at issue under the respective lawsuits, and on September 13, 2012, the federal court issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P4_S2	The federal court held a settlement hearing on November 15, 2012 to finally approve the settlement.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P4_S3	Additionally, the state court asked the parties to the state action to submit a proposed order dismissing the state action for the state court to sign upon the federal court s dismissal of the federal action.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P4_S4	The parties to the state action submitted the proposed order to settle, discontinue, and end on October 2, 2012.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P4_S5	On December 12, 2012, the federal court issued a final order and judgment approving the settlement.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P4_S6	On December 20, 2012 the state court judge issued an order to settle, discontinue, and end, and dismissed the state action with prejudice.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P5_S0	The Company is also involved in other various claims and routine litigation matters.
1096376_13_ITEM3_P5_S1	In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future years.

1096376_13_ITEM5_P7_S0	Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol NTRI.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected consolidated financial data presented below has been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the periods indicated.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data set forth below is qualified by reference to and should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements included as Items 7 and 8, respectively, in this Annual Report.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	(a) During 2012, approximately $5.7 million in severance was recorded in general and administrative expense, including approximately $3.3 million of non-cash expense related to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards, for our former President and Chief Executive Officer s cessation of employment.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P1_S1	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.1 million related to advances paid to a frozen food supplier as the supplier was in default with its bank lender and negotiating a work out plan and a charge of $2.0 million to vacate a facility.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P1_S2	We also recorded a charge of $2.5 million to restructure certain third party marketing vendor contracts and a charge of $1.1 million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	In June 2009, we abandoned our interest in Zero Technologies, LLC ( Zero Water ) as management determined that the business was no longer aligned with our strategic direction.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P2_S1	An equity and impairment loss of $4,000 was recorded during 2009 to write-off the remaining investment.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P2_S2	During 2008, we recorded an equity loss of $2,975 for our share of Zero Water s loss and the amortization expense for the difference between the cost and the underlying equity in net assets of Zero Water at the investment date.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P2_S3	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $6,483 during 2008 to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to its estimated fair value.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P2_S4	The impairment charge primarily resulted from lower-than-expected operating results and projections of future performance coupled with the non-strategic business direction of Zero Water and the overall general economic decline which indicated that the full carrying value of the equity investment was not recoverable.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	In the first quarter of 2010, we committed to a plan to sell the business operations conducted by our subsidiary, Nutrisystem Fresh, Inc. ( NuKitchen ), as it was no longer aligned with the business direction of the Company.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	During the third quarter of 2010, this business was shut down as we were unsuccessful in locating a buyer.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P3_S2	Accordingly, the operating results of this discontinued operation have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	The loss on discontinued operations during 2010 was primarily from operations.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2009, an impairment charge of $4,541 was recorded in connection with the NuKitchen acquisition.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P5_S1	This charge consisted of $2,717 of goodwill and $1,824 of identifiable intangible assets.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P5_S2	See the discussion contained in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1096376_13_ITEM6_P6_S0	LLC ( Slim and Tone ).
1096376_13_ITEM6_P6_S1	Accordingly, the operating results of this discontinued operation have been presented separately from continuing operations and are included in loss on discontinued operation, net of income tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Background We provide weight management products and services and offer nutritionally balanced weight loss programs designed for women, men, and seniors, as well as our Nutrisystem D program specifically designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our programs are based on 40 years of nutrition research and on the science of the low Glycemic Index.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, and through QVC, a television shopping network.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S3	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S4	For 2012, 2011 and 2010, the direct channel accounted for 96%, 95% and 96%, respectively, of total revenue compared to 3%, 4% and 4%, respectively, for QVC.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S5	During both 2012 and 2011, 1% of total revenue came from other channels.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S6	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brand as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S7	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S8	We market our weight management system through television, print, direct mail, Internet, public relations and social media.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S9	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, total revenues, marketing per new customer, operating margins and reactivation revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P1_S10	Our mix of revenue can be divided into three categories.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	First, new customer revenue is all revenue within a quarter from customers joining within that quarter.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	New customer revenue is the main driver of revenue growth.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	Second, on-program revenue is all revenue from customers who joined in previous quarters but who are still within their first nine months on the program.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	Third, reactivation revenue is all revenue generated from customers who are more than nine months from their initial purchase.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our eCommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	We believe this flexibility is especially valuable due to the current instability in general economic conditions.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, we initiated a concerted effort to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay, and overall customer satisfaction and are continuously redesigning our eCommerce platform and website.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	Our product offerings have expanded to include frozen foods, and we entered into the retail channel and introduced the Nutrisystem D program during the last several years.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	Further, we have taken steps to reduce our overall operating costs.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S5	Over the past several years our financial performance has been adversely impacted by a number of factors, including the economic downturn, declines in consumers discretionary spending and increased competitive activity.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S6	We believe these factors have primarily driven the decline in the number of new customer starts.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S7	We have been hampered by continued bargain-focused consumer behavior and economic concerns and reacted with discounted sales promotions, thus reducing average selling prices and gross margins which have been partially offset by increased marketing efficiency.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S8	In December 2011, we launched SUCCESS, our most comprehensive program to date and teamed with new celebrities for new national ad campaigns.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S9	The SUCCESS program is designed to help take the weight off and keep it off through frequent, portion-controlled, balanced nutrition and low Glycemic Index eating.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P3_S10	It offers our largest ever assortment of signature frozen meals including artisanal Chef s Table dinner entrees; chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and coffee advanced protein shakes; the introduction of a personalized My Daily 3 physical activity program; and increased personalization and flexibility through transition and maintenance plans that help consumers manage their weight on their own.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	We started 2012 with fewer customers on our program than at the start of 2011 as the three months ended December 31, 2011 had fewer new customer starts than the comparable period of 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	During the first six months of 2012, the number of new customer starts increased as compared to the comparable period of 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P4_S2	This trend did not continue and new customer starts for the full year 2012 decreased as compared to full year 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	Gross margins declined during 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to the promotional inclusion of our Chef s Table dinner entrees and protein shakes with new customer starts, thus allowing a large number of customers to try these new products.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	Continued price promotions and the sale of our Nutrisystem Advanced inventory to a closeout retailer as we transitioned to the SUCCESS program also impacted gross margins.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	During 2012, the Company recorded approximately $5.7 million in severance, including approximately $3.3 million of non-cash expense related to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards, for our former President and Chief Executive Officer s cessation of employment.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.1 million related to advances paid to a frozen food supplier, a charge of $2.5 million to restructure certain third party marketing vendor contracts, a charge of $2.0 million to vacate a facility and a charge of $1.1 million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Management considers the following accounting estimates to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S1	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S2	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S3	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S4	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of product sales revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S5	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $10.4 million, $12.9 million and $24.1 million, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S6	The decrease in the provision over the past several years was due to the decrease in revenue and a decrease in the return rate due to system improvements which offset the additional reserve for the new program launch.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P7_S7	The reserve for returns incurred but not received and processed was $652,000 and $726,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and has been included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continually assess the quantities of inventory on hand to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	We estimate the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecasted demand and/or our ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in our customers behavior.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $636,000 and $769,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings and expectations of future taxable income and other relevant factors.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	We estimate the annual effective income tax rate at the beginning of each year and revise the estimate at each reporting period based on a number of factors including operating results, level of tax exempt interest income and sales by state, among other items.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Results of Operations Revenue and expenses consist of the following components: Revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	Food sales include sales of food, supplements, shipping and handling charges billed to customers and sales credits and adjustments, including product returns.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	No revenue is recorded for food products provided at no charge as part of promotions.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S4	Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the products sold, including compensation related to fulfillment, the costs of outside fulfillment, incoming and outgoing shipping costs, charge card fees and packing material.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S5	Cost of products sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S6	Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S7	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S8	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S9	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S10	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P11_S11	General and administrative expense consists of compensation for administrative, information technology, counselors, customer service and sales personnel, share-based payment arrangements for related employees, facility expenses, website development costs, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Interest (expense) income, net consists of interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness net of interest income earned on cash balances and short term investments.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	We are subject to corporate level income taxes and record a provision for income taxes based on an estimated effective income tax rate for the year.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	We ceased the operations of our subsidiary, NuKitchen.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Accordingly, the operating results of NuKitchen have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Overview of the Direct Channel In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the direct channel represented 96%, 95% and 96%, respectively, of our revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	Revenues through the direct channel were $380.8 million in 2012 compared to $382.8 million in 2011 and $490.8 million in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S6	Revenue is primarily generated through customer starts, reactivation of former customers and the customer ordering behavior, including length of time on our program and the diet program selection.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P12_S7	The revenue decrease in 2012 was primarily attributable to declines in new customer starts, decreased on-program revenue and lower average selling prices partially offset by increased reactivation revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	customer starts is our ability to deploy marketing dollars while maintaining marketing effectiveness.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	Factors influencing our marketing effectiveness include the quality of the advertisements, promotional activity by our competitors, as well as the price and availability of appropriate media.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2012 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2011 Revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S1	Revenue decreased to $396.9 million in 2012 from $401.3 million in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The revenue decline occurred primarily due to declines in new customer starts, decreased on-program revenue and lower average selling prices partially offset by increased reactivation revenue.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	QVC revenue also decreased due to fewer shows and air time.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S4	In 2012, direct revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 3% for QVC and 1% for other channels.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S5	In 2011, direct revenue accounted for 95% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC and 1% for other channels.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S6	Cost of revenue increased to $213.1 million in 2012 from $198.4 million in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S7	Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 46.3% in 2012 from 50.6% in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S8	The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the promotional inclusion of additional higher cost items with customer starts.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S9	Continued price promotions and the sale of our Nutrisystem Advanced inventory to a closeout retailer as we transitioned to the SUCCESS program also negatively impacted gross margins.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S10	Marketing expense increased to $111.1 million in 2012 from $110.9 million in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S11	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to 28.0% in 2012 from 27.6% in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S12	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2012 promoted the direct business.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S13	The increase in marketing expense was attributable to increased spending for public relations ($3.2 million) primarily due to the restructuring of certain third-party marketing vendor contracts partially offset by decreased spending in media ($1.9 million) and for the production of television advertising ($2.6 million).
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S14	In total, media spending was $86.9 million in 2012 and $88.8 million in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P14_S15	General and administrative expense increased to $66.3 million in 2012 from $60.8 million in 2011 and as a percent of revenue increased to 16.7% in 2012 from 15.2% in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	higher compensation, benefits and temporary help ($879,000) and increased recruiting fees ($581,000) due to the cessation of Mr. Redling s employment.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	In total, we recorded approximately $5.7 million in severance for Mr. Redling, including approximately $3.3 million of non-cash expense related to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	The increase in compensation, benefits and temporary help was partially offset by savings achieved from the workforce reduction in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P15_S3	Also, there were increased professional and outside computer services expenses ($998,000) due to increased legal fees and increased facilities expense ($1.5 million) due mainly to charges incurred to vacate a facility.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P15_S4	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge ($2.1 million) related to advances paid to a frozen food supplier as the supplier was in default with its bank lender and was in the process of negotiating a work out plan and exploring other strategic alternatives.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P15_S5	Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $10.7 million in 2012 from $12.1 million in 2011 due to the normal retirement of assets during 2012.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P15_S6	Interest expense, net, was $2.0 million in 2012 compared to $468,000 in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	In November 2012, we terminated and replaced our then existing credit facility.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	In connection with the termination, we wrote off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and also terminated the outstanding interest rate swap agreements resulting in a combined charge of $1.2 million.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Additionally, interest rates increased during 2012 as compared to 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	In 2012, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.7 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 56.7% as compared to $6.4 million of income tax expense in 2011 with an effective tax rate of 34.3%.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	The change in the effective income tax rate was due to favorable book to tax differences including the elimination of the limitation on executive compensation deductions, reductions in tax reserves and increased food donations combined with lower pre-tax income levels which resulted in income tax benefits.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Revenue decreased to $401.3 million in 2011 from $509.5 million in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The revenue decline occurred across all of our sales channels primarily due to lower average selling prices and fewer customer starts and on-program customers as a result of bargain-focused consumer behavior and discounted promotional offerings.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	In 2011, direct revenue accounted for 95% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC and 1% for other channels.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	In 2010, direct revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	Cost of revenue decreased to $198.4 million in 2011 from $224.8 million in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 50.6% in 2011 from 55.9% in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S6	The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to our promotional pricing and to an increase in the sales of our frozen food programs, which have a higher cost per sales dollar.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S7	Marketing expense decreased to $110.9 million in 2011 from $145.9 million in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P17_S8	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue decreased to 27.6% in 2011 from 28.6% in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	During the beginning of the first quarter of 2011, we experienced significant pressures on response and conversion rates across all sales channels causing a decrease in new customers and directly impacting our marketing efficiency.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	As a result, we reduced the spending for advertising media but increased our promotional incentives to increase demand and leverage marketing efficiency.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2011 promoted the direct business.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	The decrease in marketing expense was attributable to decreased spending in media ($38.8 million) partially offset by increased spending for the production of television advertising ($3.7 million).
1096376_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	In total, media spending was $88.8 million in 2011 and $127.6 million in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	General and administrative expense decreased to $60.8 million in 2011 from $73.9 million in 2010 and as a percent of revenue increased to 15.2% in 2011 from 14.5% in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	lower compensation, benefits and temporary help ($7.8 million), decreased professional and outside computer services ($2.1 million), lower facilities expense ($1.3 million) and decreased non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements ($1.9 million).
1096376_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	We implemented a series of measures, including reductions in headcount and outside professional services during the first quarter of 2011 that resulted in reductions in our general and administrative expenses.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $12.1 million in 2011 from $11.8 million in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P20_S3	Interest expense, net, was $468,000 in 2011 compared to interest income, net, of $5,000 in the comparable period of 2010 due to increased average borrowings outstanding during 2011 under our credit facility.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P20_S4	In 2011, we recorded income tax expense of $6.4 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 34.3% as compared to $19.3 million of income tax expense in 2010 with an effective tax rate of 36.3%.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P20_S5	The change in the effective tax rate was due to the impact of limitations on executive compensation deductions and food donations in comparison to pre-tax income, as well as reductions in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations during the fourth quarter of 2011 and tax credits and other miscellaneous adjustments occurring throughout the year.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments As of December 31, 2012, our principal commitments consisted of obligations under supply agreements with food vendors, an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, operating leases and employment contracts.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate continuing requirements for capital expenditures.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	Following is a summary of our contractual obligations.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S2	We have no other commercial commitments.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S3	We have entered into supply agreements with various food vendors.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S4	The majority of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S5	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S6	Additionally, we have entered into an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider which contains minimum space requirements.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S7	We anticipate that we will meet all annual purchase and space obligations.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P22_S8	In addition, we have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	The capital and credit markets have become more volatile as a result of the recent global economic conditions, which has caused a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity and increased financing costs.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	Despite these factors, we believe that available capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, dividends and share repurchases for the foreseeable future.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	At December 31, 2012, we had working capital of $31.4 million, a decrease of $44.8 million from the $76.2 million working capital balance at December 31, 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 were $16.2 million, a decrease of $31.4 million from the balance of $47.6 million at December 31, 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S2	In addition, we had $3.2 million invested in short term investments at December 31, 2012 as compared to $10.0 million at December 31, 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S3	The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the repayment of $30.0 million outstanding under our previous $100.0 million credit facility in November 2012.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S4	Our principal sources of liquidity during 2012 were cash flows from operations.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S5	On November 8, 2012, we entered into a new $40.0 million secured revolving credit facility, as amended, with a new lender.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S6	The $40.0 million credit facility provides for interest on borrowings at either a base rate or a London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin and is also subject to an unused fee payable quarterly.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S7	The $40.0 million credit facility contains financial and other covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a minimum consolidated liquidity ratio, and includes limitations on, among other things, capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, acquisitions, stock repurchases and restrictions on paying dividends in certain circumstances.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S8	The $40.0 million credit facility can be drawn upon through November 8, 2015, at which time all amounts must be repaid.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S9	All outstanding amounts under the previous $100.0 million credit facility were paid.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S10	In connection with the termination of the previous $100.0 million credit facility, we wrote off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and also terminated the outstanding interest rate swap agreements resulting in a combined charge of $1.2 million.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P24_S11	As of December 31, 2012, no amounts were outstanding under the $40.0 million credit facility.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	In 2012, we generated cash flow of $22.8 million from operating activities, a decrease of $24.5 million from 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	The decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to the net loss in 2012 compared to net income in 2011 and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P25_S2	In 2012, net cash used in investing activities was $2.8 million primarily from capital additions of $9.6 million which offset $6.8 million of net proceeds from sales of short term investments.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P25_S3	We are continuing to invest in our ecommerce and web platform to incorporate new product initiatives.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	In 2012, net cash used in financing activities was $51.4 million, an increase of $28.4 million from 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	During 2012, we repaid $30.0 million outstanding under our previous $100.0 million credit facility.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	On July 28, 2011, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open-market transactions on the NASDAQ Stock Market or through privately negotiated transactions, including block transactions.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	The timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	The stock repurchase program has an expiration date of June 30, 2013 but may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.175 per share, which were paid on March 26, 2012, May 21, 2012, August 16, 2012 and November 29, 2012.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P27_S4	Subsequent to December 31, 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share payable on March 25, 2013 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2013.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P27_S5	Although we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to quarterly determination by our Board of Directors following its review of our financial performance.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter.
1096376_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet and the price and availability of certain media.
1096376_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 of $16.2 million were maintained in bank and money market accounts.
1096376_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Additionally, we invested $3.2 million in short term investments, which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As such, a change in interest rates of 1 percentage point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows.
1096376_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Controls and Procedures The Securities and Exchange Commission defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms.
1096376_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures by our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.

1096376_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1096376_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1096376_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1096376_13_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1096376_13_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012.

1096376_13_ITEM9A_P6_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1096376_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P10_S0	BACKGROUND Nature of the Business Nutrisystem, Inc. (the Company or Nutrisystem ), a provider of weight management products and services, offers nutritionally balanced weight loss programs designed for women, men, and seniors, as well as the Nutrisystem D program, specifically designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P10_S1	The Nutrisystem programs are based on 40 years of nutrition research and on the science of the low glycemic index.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P11_S0	The Company s pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network and a new retail line.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P11_S1	Approximately 100%, 99% and 98% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were generated in the United States.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P12_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets and liabilities of Nutrisystem, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P12_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P13_S0	Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments Cash equivalents include only securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P13_S1	At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, demand accounts and money market accounts comprised all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P14_S0	Short term investments consist of investments in corporate debt securities, time deposits with original maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase and a municipal income fund.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P14_S1	The Company classifies these as available-for-sale securities.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P14_S2	These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P15_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P15_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2012, 2011 or 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P16_S0	Inventories Inventories consist principally of packaged food held in outside fulfillment locations.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P16_S1	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P16_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P16_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P16_S4	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $636 and $769 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P17_S0	Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P18_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally two to seven years.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P19_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P19_S1	Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P20_S0	Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development incurred during the application development stage.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P20_S1	Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally two to five years.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P21_S0	Costs incurred related to planning or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are charged to expense as incurred.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P21_S1	The net book value of capitalized software was $10,511 and $10,285 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P22_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P22_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P22_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P22_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P23_S0	As of December 31, 2012, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P24_S0	Derivative Instruments Interest rate swap agreements, a type of financial derivative instrument, were utilized by the Company to reduce interest rate risk on credit facility borrowings.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P24_S1	The Company recognized the interest rate swaps in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P24_S2	The Company designated and accounted for its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable-rate debt.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P24_S3	The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged transactions affected earnings.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P24_S4	To the extent that the change in value of the derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P25_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is upon transfer of title to the product.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P25_S1	Recognition of revenue upon shipment meets the revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P25_S2	The Company also sells prepaid program cards to wholesalers and retailers.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P25_S3	Revenue from these cards is recognized after the card is redeemed online at the Company s website by the customer and the product is shipped to the customer.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P25_S4	Deferred revenue consists primarily of unredeemed prepaid program cards and unshipped frozen foods.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P26_S0	When a customer orders the Nutrisystem Select program, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P26_S1	The first shipment contains Nutrisystem s standard shelf-stable food.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P26_S2	The second shipment contains the frozen foods and is generally delivered within a week of a customer s order.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P26_S3	Both shipments qualify as separate units of accounting and the fair value is based on estimated selling prices of both units.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P27_S0	Customers may return unopened product within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P27_S1	Frozen products are non-returnable and non-refundable unless the order is canceled within 14 days of delivery.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P27_S2	Estimated returns are accrued at the time the sale is recognized and actual returns are tracked monthly.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P27_S3	The Company reviews its history of actual versus estimated returns to ensure reserves are appropriate.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P27_S4	Revenue from product sales includes amounts billed for shipping and handling and is presented net of returns and billed sales tax.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P27_S5	Revenue from shipping and handling charges was $2,394, $2,867 and $5,763 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P27_S6	Shipping-related costs are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P28_S0	Dependence on Suppliers In 2012, approximately 17% and 13%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P28_S1	The Company has a supply arrangement with one of these vendors that requires the Company to make minimum purchases.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P28_S2	In 2011, these vendors supplied approximately 16% and 15%, respectively, of inventory purchases and in 2010, approximately 17% and 18%, respectively, of inventory purchases (see Note 7).
1096376_13_ITEM15_P28_S3	Additionally, the Company was dependent on one frozen food supplier for less than 20% of its food costs in 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P28_S4	The Company had a supply agreement with this supplier that expired in November 2011, and the Company found other frozen food supply options to replace this supplier.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P28_S5	The amount provided from this supplier in 2010 was negligible.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P28_S6	The Company outsources 100% of its fulfillment operations to a third party provider and more than 90% of its orders were shipped by one third party provider.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P29_S0	Vendor Rebates One of the Company s suppliers provides for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company accounts for this rebate on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percentage determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the vendor.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P29_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P29_S3	A receivable is recorded for the estimate of the rebate earned.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P29_S4	The rebate period is June 1 through May 31 of each year.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P29_S5	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company reduced cost of revenue by $1,496, $1,401 and $1,912, respectively, for these rebates.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P29_S6	A receivable of $637 and $686 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, has been recorded in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P30_S0	Historically, the actual rebate received from the vendor has closely matched the estimated rebate recorded.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P30_S1	An adjustment is made to the estimate upon determination of the final rebate.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P31_S0	Marketing Expense Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P31_S1	Media expense was $86,948, $88,828 and $127,597 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P32_S0	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the direct mailing and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P32_S1	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P32_S2	Typically, this period falls within 40 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P32_S3	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P32_S4	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, $1,998 and $4,800, respectively, of costs have been prepaid for future advertisements and promotions.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P33_S0	Lease Related Expenses Certain of the Company s lease contracts contain rent holidays, various escalation clauses, or landlord/tenant incentives.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P34_S0	holidays, on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P35_S0	Lease allowances utilized for space improvement are recorded as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P35_S1	Tenant lease incentive allowances received are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P35_S2	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is $3,301 of a tenant improvement allowance at December 31, 2012, of which $345 is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $2,956 in non-current liabilities.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P35_S3	At December 31, 2011, the tenant improvement allowance was $3,646, of which $345 was included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $3,301 in non-current liabilities.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P36_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P36_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P36_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P37_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P37_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P37_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P37_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P37_S4	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest (expense) income, net.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company is managed and operated as one business.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P38_S1	The entire business is managed by a single management team that reports to the chief executive officer.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P38_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P39_S0	Earnings Per Share The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P40_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P40_S1	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P40_S2	Undistributed losses are not allocated to unvested restricted stock as the restricted stockholders are not obligated to share in the losses.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P41_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:
1096376_13_ITEM15_P42_S0	In 2012, diluted loss per common share is identical to basic loss per common share as the Company is in a net loss position and the impact of including common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P42_S1	In 2012, 2011 and 2010, common stock equivalents representing 1,637,400, 656,871 and 167,158 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P43_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P44_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P44_S1	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P44_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P45_S0	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (derived service period for market-based restricted stock unit awards), net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P45_S1	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options, granting of restricted stock or vesting of restricted stock units.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P46_S1	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $1,250, $6,049 and $16,660 in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P47_S1	The amendment requires that all non-owner changes in stockholder s equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P47_S2	The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and should be applied retrospectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P48_S0	The Company has added separate consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income to the accompanying financial statements.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P48_S2	The updated standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012, with early adoption permitted.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P48_S3	The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P49_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P49_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P54_S0	The fair values of the Company s Level 1 instruments are based on quoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P54_S1	The fair values of the Company s Level 2 instruments were based on quoted prices in less active markets.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P54_S2	The fair values of the Company s derivative instruments were determined using pricing models that took into account contract terms and certain observable current market information such as London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) interest rates.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P54_S3	The Company had no Level 3 instruments at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P56_S2	All outstanding amounts under the $100,000 Facility were repaid and in connection with the termination of the facility, the Company wrote off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of $1,079 and also terminated the outstanding interest rate swap agreements resulting in a charge of $132 during 2012.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P56_S3	These amounts are included within interest (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P57_S0	The $40,000 Facility provides for interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P57_S1	The base rate will be the highest of (i) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (ii) 0.50% percent above the Federal Funds Rate and (iii) the LIBOR rate for deposits in dollars for a one-month interest period as determined three business days prior to such date, plus 1.50%.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P57_S2	The LIBOR rate is equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the relevant term.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P57_S3	The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the Company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and ranges from 0.25-1.25% per year for base rate loans and from 1.75-2.75% per year for LIBOR rate loans.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P59_S0	While interest rate swaps are subject to fluctuations in value, these fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P60_S0	The Company minimized the risk of credit loss by entering into these agreements with financial institutions that have high credit ratings.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P60_S1	In January and June 2012, respectively, the Company entered into two separate $10,000 notional value forward-starting interest rate swaps.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P78_S1	A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows:
1096376_13_ITEM15_P79_S0	The change in the effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 was due to favorable book to tax differences including the elimination of the limitation on executive compensation deductions due to the nonrenewal of an executive s employment agreement in April 2012, reductions in tax reserves and increased food donations combined with lower pre-tax income levels resulted in income tax benefits for 2012 versus expense for 2011.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P79_S1	The change in the effective tax rate from 2010 to 2011 was due to the impact of limitations on executive compensation deductions and food donations in comparison to pre-tax income, as well as reductions in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations during the fourth quarter of 2011 and tax credits and other miscellaneous adjustments occurring throughout the year.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P87_S0	vesting provisions of all awards and the exercise price per share of stock options issued under the plans, which is the fair market value at date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P87_S1	Awards issued to employees generally vest over terms ranging from two to five years.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P87_S2	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity for 2010, 2011 and 2012: In 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded pre-tax compensation charges of $1,163 and $150, respectively, for stock option awards.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P87_S3	In 2010, the Company did not record any compensation charges for stock option awards as all outstanding awards were fully vested.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P87_S4	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 2012 and 2011 was $1.96 and $4.50, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P87_S5	There were no option grants in 2010.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P87_S6	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $67, $204 and $1,001, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P88_S0	The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:
1096376_13_ITEM15_P89_S0	In 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company authorized the issuance of 42,882, 30,275 and 19,124 fully vested shares of common stock, respectively, as compensation to the Board of Directors resulting in compensation expense of $455 in each year.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P89_S1	In addition, in 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company issued a total of 21,626, 124,561, and 11,576 shares of common stock, respectively, to non-employees for services.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P89_S2	Costs recognized for shares issued to non-employees for services were $573, $841 and $167 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and approximated fair value.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company has issued restricted stock to employees generally with vesting terms ranging from two to five years.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P90_S1	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P91_S0	Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P91_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for 2010, 2011 and 2012: Additionally, the Company grants restricted stock units.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P91_S2	The restricted stock units granted during 2010 and 2011 were primarily performance-based units.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P91_S3	The performance-based units have performance conditions and service-based vesting conditions.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P91_S4	Each vesting tranche is treated as an individual award and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P91_S5	The requisite service period is a combination of the performance period and the subsequent vesting period based on continued service.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P91_S6	The level of achievement of such goals may cause the actual amount of units that ultimately vest to range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted, which is reflected as performance factor adjustment in the table below.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company recognizes expense for performance-based restricted stock units when it is probable that the performance criteria specified will be achieved and then recognizes ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P93_S0	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P94_S0	In 2012, grants of restricted stock units contained market-based conditions.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P94_S1	Market-based awards entitle employees to vest in a number of units determined by the Company s stock price return as compared to a set of comparator companies over a period, and will range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P94_S2	The fair value is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P94_S3	Compensation expense is recognized over the derived service periods using the straight-line method regardless of the outcome of the market conditions, so long as the award holder remains an employee through the requisite service period.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P94_S4	These awards contained different measurement periods including one that begins in 2013.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P95_S0	The fair value of the market-based restricted stock units utilized the following inputs and assumptions:
1096376_13_ITEM15_P96_S0	The performance period starting price is measured as the average closing price over the last 20 trading days prior to the performance period start.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P96_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock unit activity:
1096376_13_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company recorded compensation expense of $7,721, $8,312 and $10,329 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in connection with the issuance of the restricted shares and restricted stock units.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P97_S1	As of December 31, 2012, 794,095 shares of restricted stock and 128,560 restricted stock units were expected to vest.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P97_S2	The Company recognized an (increase)/decrease in taxes payable of ($593), ($919) and $418 in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, from the exercise of certain stock options and restricted stock and payment of certain dividends and recorded these amounts as decreases and increases to APIC in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P97_S3	As of December 31, 2012, there was $9,836 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.

1096376_13_ITEM15_P99_S5	The Company s contributions in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $614, $692 and $528, respectively.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P100_S0	Following is an analysis for the returns reserve:
1096376_13_ITEM15_P101_S0	The sum of the quarterly basic and diluted per share amounts may not equal amounts reported for the year.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P101_S1	This is due to the effects of rounding and changes in weighted average shares outstanding for each period.
1096376_13_ITEM15_P102_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a charge of $2,476 to restructure certain third party marketing vendor contracts, a charge of $1,980 to vacate a facility and a charge of $1,079 to write off unamortized debt issuance costs.

1096376_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages containing a 28-day supply of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and desserts, which they supplement with fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Most of our customers order on an auto-delivery basis ( Auto-Delivery ), in which we send a 28-day food supply on an ongoing basis until notified by the customer to stop our shipments.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P0_S3	We offer personalized plans where customers can hand pick their entire menu or go with our pre-selected favorites food pack.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P0_S4	Our meal plans feature more than 150 menu options at different price points including frozen and ready-to-go entrees, desserts, snacks and shakes.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we offer complimentary, optional counseling from trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators and provide further support through our online community and tools.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our program is based on the following cornerstones that represent who we are to our customers: Real Results.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	We believe our program enables our customers to lose weight successfully.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	Our program is portioned for weight loss and offers a balance of carbohydrate, protein and fat that meets national dietary guidelines.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	We also offer transition and maintenance plans, which include support tools and desired menu options that customers wish to continue to receive from Nutrisystem.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	These plans are designed to help our customers keep the weight off.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Nutrisystem program is based on over 40 years of nutrition research and the science of the low Glycemic Index, and offers portion-controlled items that include relatively higher amounts of fiber, contain good carbohydrates and zero trans fats.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Foods on the lower end of the Glycemic Index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	We sell our weight management program primarily through a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution approach using the Internet and telephone.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our customers can order 24 hours a day, seven days a week on our website, www.nutrisystem.com , and the food is shipped directly to the customer s door.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our customers can either choose our pre-selected favorites food pack or customize their monthly food orders for their specific tastes or dietary needs.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our program does not require customers to visit centers, measure foods or count calories.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P4_S4	The entrees are individually packaged and food preparation time is minimal.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet and telephone provides the privacy that our customers value.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	We provide online and telephone counseling and support to our customers using our trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and other nutrition and dietary staff, and thus, our customers do not need to travel for a face-to-face meeting.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	We believe we are very competitively priced within the weight management industry.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P5_S3	We do not charge membership fees.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P5_S4	Various promotional offers and pricing are offered throughout the year.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe our program offers consumers a sensible approach to losing weight without the use of faddish, unhealthy or unrealistic weight loss methods.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths: Product Efficacy .
1096376_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using our program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P6_S3	Our customer research found that customers lost an average of 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and tended to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P6_S4	We believe our research indicates overall satisfaction with our program and a potential willingness to refer our program to others.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	We have also sponsored clinical trials at leading academic centers in patients with type 2 diabetes.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	Statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in glycemic control were observed, in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe that our brand is well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our company and our predecessors have been in the weight management industry for over 40 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we generate revenue in our direct channel through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards).
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S2	We also minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment: we outsource the production of our food products to a number of vendors and we outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations to a third party provider.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S3	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight management program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S4	Our customers primarily place their orders through the Internet or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their homes.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S5	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets, which rely on weight-loss centers, cannot ensure.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S6	Additionally, we provide our customers with a month of food, including daily breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert, which removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S7	We believe our weight management program offers our customers significant value and is priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P10_S8	In addition, we do not charge a membership fee, whereas many of our competitors do.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S., as well as the global population.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Study estimated that more than one-third of U.S. adults were obese in 2011-2012 and the World Health Organization projects that by 2015, 2.3 billion people will be overweight and 700 million of these will be obese.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Obesity is increasingly prevalent in children and studies have shown for the first time significant emergence of diseases such as type 2 diabetes in adolescents and young adults.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our clinical trial results suggest and analyses of real world customer results confirm that people who stay on the Nutrisystem program for at least three months have a high probability of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	In addition to the health risks, there are also cultural implications for those who are overweight or obese.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	U.S. consumers are inundated with imagery in media, fashion and entertainment that depicts the thin body as the ideal body type.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Studies suggest that there is rampant discrimination against the obese.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	Despite the high percentage of overweight and obese individuals in the U.S., the popularity of dieting appears to indicate consumers desire to be thin.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Competition The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and other medically supervised programs.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	Our identified peers and competitors include, but are not limited to, Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., eDiets.com, Jenny Craig, Medifast, Inc. and Weight Watchers International, Inc.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight management industry.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	By providing a well-recognized food-based program using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	Our Products and Services For over 40 years, the Nutrisystem name has been recognized as a leader in the weight loss industry.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P17_S5	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting primarily of a pre-packaged food program, online tools and counseling.

1096376_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	Trained counselors are available to answer questions and make recommendations to help each customer achieve and maintain his or her weight loss goal.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Customers support and encourage each other and share information through hosted Internet chat rooms and bulletin boards.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	These services are complemented with relevant information on diet, nutrition and physical activity, including a personalized My Daily 3 physical activity program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	Additionally, online weight management tools are available to our customers.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	These tools include the interactive Mindset Makeover guide, a behavior modification program that is offered to our customers free of charge.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P19_S4	This insightful and motivational guide walks customers through the program and can serve as an interactive tool for our counselors to use to facilitate communication and enhance weight loss success for our customers.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our Nutrisystem program consists of over 150 portion-controlled items that serve as the foundation of a low Glycemic Index diet.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	Our program is portioned for weight loss and offers a balance of carbohydrate, protein and fat that meets national dietary guidelines.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	We have also worked to reduce the sodium content of our meal program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	Including grocery additions to supplement our meals, our plans contain 1800-2200 milligrams of sodium per day, consistent with national guidelines, and tailored versions of the plans are available that deliver as low as 1500 mg/day.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P20_S4	In contrast, the average American consumes 2800-4000 milligrams of sodium per day.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P20_S5	We constantly strive to meet or exceed nutritional guidelines as they are updated.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P20_S6	In December 2013, we launched Nutrisystem My Way, a program tailored to the individual s metabolism, along with our Fast 5 kit, a one-week kick start that can help customers lose five pounds in their first week of dieting.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	success is quick, early results, which Fast 5 is designed to deliver.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Fast 5 includes seven days of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, plus all-new shakes with formulations for men and women to meet their unique nutritional needs.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Nutrisystem My Way program uses an algorithm to estimate each customer s metabolic rate in order to create a customized program tailored to the amount of calories needed for healthy weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Customers are given a meal plan and exercise suggestions and are encouraged to check in periodically with a Nutrisystem counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Nutrisystem My Way program delivers a combination of portion-controlled foods and an eating plan based on slow digesting carbohydrates and fiber, designed to help keep blood sugar levels stable throughout the day minimizing hunger spikes and the feelings of deprivation that cause cravings.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Additionally, we introduced new 5-day Jumpstart Your Weight Loss Kits in 2013 which were available exclusively at Walmart and represent a significant departure from our traditional 28-day program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	We offer a core 5-day kit, a D kit targeted to individuals with or at risk of type 2 diabetes, as well as SmartCarb and PowerFuel products including blueberry muffins, cinnamon buns, vanilla shakes, chocolate shakes and chocolate chip cookie packs, designed to complement the D kit.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	This partnership with Walmart provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our program an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at an attractive price point.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P23_S4	We are seeing repeat business at Walmart as well as multiple kit purchases, indicating that customers are seeing results or enlisting other family members to diet with them.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P23_S5	Also, we continue to offer our program at Costco through the use of prepaid program cards and gift cards.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P23_S6	We are actively developing our retail product pipeline and we expect to have additional products/kits to launch in retail.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Nutrisystem D Program is a weight loss program specifically designed to produce gradual weight loss in overweight persons with, or at risk for, diabetes.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	It provides nutrition consistent with the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Two randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed medical journals found the Nutrisystem D program, in combination with counseling sessions, produced statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in weight, HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control), and several other risk factors.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	Notably, improvements in diabetes control were observed despite a reduction in diabetes medications among participants who received the Nutrisystem D intervention.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	A third study, utilizing continuous glucose monitoring technology, found improvements in blood glucose control when subjects used the Nutrisystem D program, even before the achievement of significant weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	By offering a variety of frozen and ready-to-go foods, we help our customers sustain their weight loss efforts.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	On our website, customers can order food 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P26_S2	The transition and maintenance plans allow customers the means to gradually increase their responsibility for grocery shopping and food preparation while adhering to the principles of the Nutrisystem approach.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P26_S3	These lower cost programs help extend the supportive relationship and allow time to reinforce the dietary changes that produced the initial weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P26_S4	These plans include recipes and portion-control tools in addition to a reduced number of Nutrisystem entrees delivered each month.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	The features of our weight loss program address many of the most common limitations of traditional weight loss programs, including high initiation and recurring membership fees, the inconvenience of traveling to weight loss centers for scheduled appointments and lack of privacy.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	In addition, our prepared meals provide our customers with a structured program with limited weighing and measuring of foods and no need to count calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	We believe that the convenience of home delivery, reduced grocery shopping time and rapid food preparation also aid customer compliance with our weight loss program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our food items have accounted for 99% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	No other product or service has accounted for more than 1% of our revenue in any of the last three years.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	In the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, approximately 99%, 98% and 97%, respectively, of our revenues were generated in the United States.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Customer Experience Our sales, marketing, ecommerce, and service operations seek to understand our customers needs throughout their weight loss and management journey, so we can develop effective and compelling products and services.

1096376_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	Sales agents, paid primarily on commission, take in-bound responses from our advertisements, and personalize the weight loss plan for each customer.

1096376_14_ITEM1_P30_S12	Counselors are trained in our programs, motivational techniques and problem solving.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P30_S13	Counselors take in-bound requests for help and also reach out to customers via email and phone.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	Transition and Maintenance As customers reach their weight loss goals, we offer transition and maintenance programs that provide products and guidance that combine the right amount of structure and flexibility.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	These programs are offered online, via email marketing, and via our call center s retention agents.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	Return/Reactivation Because we realize that weight management is a lifelong process, and that customers may need our programs again from time to time, we reach out to past customers to attempt to put them back on structured programs as needed.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	We attract past customers primarily via our advertising vehicles, targeted emails, and data-driven direct mail attempts.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	Customer Service We are committed to the highest levels of customer service.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P32_S3	Our representatives are trained to answer questions and solve problems once a purchase has been made.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P32_S4	Customers contact us via email and phone.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P32_S5	Typical inquiries concern delivery dates, reported missing or damaged items, and requests for credits or exchanges.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	For email inquiries, we have a software system that scans the customer s email for key words and automatically supplies the representative with a response that is then reviewed, edited, and sent to the customer.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	We regularly review customer satisfaction levels and improve our practices accordingly.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	We conduct a proactive public relations program that is designed to garner positive coverage of Nutrisystem and our weight management programs across all media platforms including television, magazine, print, online news, bloggers and social media, particularly around the key dieting seasons.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P33_S3	In addition, the public relations team supports an executive communication program to broadly support the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	An integrated order receipt, billing, picking, shipping and delivery tracking system comprised of proprietary and third party components is utilized for our orders.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	This system integrates the front end, or website customer interface, with order processing and shipping, and allows customers to access shippers order tracking numbers online.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	Our computer-assisted picking system allows for virtually paperless order picking in all warehouse facilities.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S3	We utilize an integrated network of distribution facilities through an existing arrangement with our outside fulfillment provider.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S4	We work closely with our fulfillment provider to drive out waste and continuously improve processes.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S5	We currently utilize five outsourced distribution facilities.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S6	Three are located in Pennsylvania (Allentown, Bethlehem and Chambersburg) and two in Nevada (both in Sparks).
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S7	As of December 31, 2013, all fulfillment was being handled by one outsourced provider.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S8	We have a service agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, which provides for storage, handling of frozen and ready-to-go foods and other services, including pricing and minimum space commitments.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P34_S9	The current contract expires on April 30, 2015, but may be terminated sooner upon 180 days written notice.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	We believe that other outside fulfillment providers could be utilized if needed and we continually evaluate the need for secondary fulfillment services.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	We continue to partner with our fulfillment provider to reduce the warehouse order turn-around time for processing and shipping orders.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	In 2013, approximately 98% of all ready-to-go customer initial orders were shipped within three business days of the date the order was received.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	Additionally, approximately 97% of all frozen customer initial orders were shipped within four business days of the date the order was received.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P35_S4	We can also deliver to approximately 99% of the domestic population within five business days using standard ground transportation.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	Direct customers are not charged for their orders until the ordered product is shipped.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	We do not charge customers for shipping and handling on Auto-Delivery food orders provided customers take receipt of their second order.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	If a customer cancels before receipt of a second order, the customer will be charged for shipping and the difference in pricing for an Auto-Delivery order versus a non Auto-Delivery order.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	All of our foods and supplements are currently outsourced from more than 30 manufacturers or vendors.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	We have entered into supply agreements with some of these food vendors.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Several of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S4	These contracts may be terminated by us upon written notice, generally between 30 and 180 days, or under certain circumstances only upon a default of the vendor.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S5	We anticipate meeting all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S6	In 2013, approximately 14% and 12%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two vendors.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S7	We have supply arrangements with these vendors that require us to make certain minimum purchases.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S8	In 2012, these vendors supplied approximately 17% and 13%, respectively, of inventory purchases and in 2011, approximately 16% and 15%, respectively, of inventory purchases.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S9	Additionally, we were dependent on one frozen food vendor for less than 20% of our food costs in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P37_S10	We had a supply agreement with this vendor that expired in November 2011, and we have found other frozen food supply options to replace this vendor.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	Our product development team uses a number of sources customer feedback, market trends, nutrition science, and breakthroughs in food technology to create new ideas for our program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	New foods are created to enhance the variety of our current offerings or to support the efforts of creating a new program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	Typically, concepts are formulated in our test kitchen to meet our stringent demands for nutrition and stability.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	We then contract with food manufacturers who further develop viable new products based on our specifications.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P38_S4	Alternatively, food manufacturers may suggest items.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P38_S5	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste (using testing panels), and cost considerations.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	Our Customers We offer weight loss programs designed for women, men, seniors as well as people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P40_S1	Based on our customer research, our typical customer is female, approximately 50 years of age and weighs approximately 187 pounds.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P40_S2	We believe that, on average, our customers want to lose approximately 44 pounds over a period of time.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P40_S3	Additionally, based on our customer research, we believe our typical customers tend to stay on our program for 11 to 12 weeks, lose 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and have tried other popular diet programs.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P40_S4	We believe that this research indicates a willingness to refer our program to others and that our customers value the following Nutrisystem program attributes:
1096376_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	they do not feel hungry while on the program.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	Our ecommerce and community websites, both of which are based primarily on third party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in a top tier, co-location facility.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	These facilities provide redundant network connections, physical and fire security and diesel generated power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely and are intended to provide an uninterruptible power supply.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	When our customers place an order or access their account information, we secure that transaction by using some of the best available encryption technologies, including secure sockets layer, or SSL.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P42_S5	Our customer data is protected against unauthorized access by security measures and we engage a variety of industry leading technology providers including VeriSign, CyberSource and SecureWorks to further ensure the security of our credit card transactions and the safety of our customers personal information.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P42_S6	We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P44_S1	We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P44_S2	Employees As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 430 employees and consider our relations with these employees to be good.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

1096376_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our marketing expenditures were $95.8 million, $111.1 million and $110.9 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our program which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment and Internet and networking services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We rely solely on third party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In 2013, approximately 14% and 12%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two vendors.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food and other products in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In 2013, more than 95% of our orders were shipped by one third party provider and 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by one third party provider.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access and networking, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Further, if our website or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brand and loss of sales.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Therefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P4_S8	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) or United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Some of our counselors for our weight management program do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields and have only undergone the training they receive from us.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Our weight loss program does not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S9	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management program.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S10	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S11	Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S12	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S13	If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S14	Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P5_S15	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management program.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are dependent on certain third party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third party retailers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products and services are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Additionally, some agreements contain exclusive rights in specified locations to promote our products during the contract term and for a specified period thereafter.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If any third party elects not to renew their agreement with us or reduces the promotion of our products, our revenues will suffer.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in competitive advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our program.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P8_S5	While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our website.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	A significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Additional states and governmental entities are considering such notice laws.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our website or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our website or purchasing our services or products.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S5	We rely on third party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S6	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S7	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S8	We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S9	Our business is seasonal, with revenues generally stronger in the first quarter and weaker in the fourth quarter.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S10	The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S11	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S12	Future acquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S13	A component of our growth strategy may be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and services.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P11_S14	Even if we succeed in acquiring or building such businesses, we will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P12_S3	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P12_S4	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P12_S5	If our brand suffers or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We use third-party marketing vendors to promote our products.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight management program.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Third parties may infringe on our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S7	If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S8	Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S10	In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S11	We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S12	We may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S13	Third parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S14	Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S15	In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S16	If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P13_S17	Any of these results could reduce our revenues and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Our credit agreement, as amended, contains financial and other covenants.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our credit agreement, as amended, contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a minimum consolidated liquidity ratio, and includes limitations on, among other things, capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, acquisitions, stock repurchases and restrictions on paying dividends in certain circumstances.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement, as amended, may result in an event of default under the agreement.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S4	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S5	If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S6	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S7	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S8	We have not obtained life insurance on any key executive officers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S9	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S10	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S11	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P14_S12	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Risks Related to Our Industry Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our program features pre-packaged food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our pre-packaged food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S9	If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	More recently, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity, and restrictions of our business operations.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	In October 2009, the FTC published its revised Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising which now requires us to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our program when using a customer s weight loss testimonial in advertising.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	For example, the labeling and distribution of food products are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and remain unsettled.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, vitamins, nutritional supplements and minerals, including our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P24_S2	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P24_S4	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_14_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenues and profits.
1096376_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	lease one location in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
1096376_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	This location totals approximately 119,767 square feet of office space and expires in 2022.
1096376_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	We also have a lease in Hoboken, New Jersey which is approximately 2,515 square feet of office space and expires in 2014.
1096376_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	We have additional fulfillment capacity in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	We have no lease obligations to any of our outsourced fulfillment providers; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.
1096376_14_ITEM2_P0_S5	Management believes the outsourced fulfillment capacity is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	On March 6, 2012, in response to the filing by a competitor of numerous trademark applications containing the term NUTRILITE in various weight-loss and weight-management classes, the Company sent a cease and desist letter to the competitor claiming that its use of such mark is very similar to the Company s NUTRISYSTEM mark for very similar Company goods and services in the weight-loss and weight-management industries.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The Company alleged that such use would result in confusion amongst consumers with respect to the source of such goods and services and would constitute an infringement of the Company s mark in violation of the Trademark Act of 1946 (the Lanham Act), as well as various other federal and state laws governing trademarks, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices, and would likely cause dilution of the Company s famous and distinctive mark.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	On March 16, 2012, the competitor responded to such letter by filing a complaint for declaratory relief against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan (listed under docket number 1:12-cv-00256-RHB) asking the Court to declare that plaintiff s use and registration of its mark does not (i) constitute trademark infringement, federal unfair competition, federal dilution, (ii) violate certain Michigan statutes; and (iii) constitute common law trademark infringement or common law unfair competition.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	On April 27, 2012, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	On May 29, 2012, plaintiff filed its brief in opposition to the Company s motion to dismiss the complaint, and on June 15, 2012 the Company filed its reply brief in support of its motion to dismiss the complaint.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	On October 9, 2012, the Court denied the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	On October 23, 2012, the Company filed its answer and affirmative defenses to plaintiff s complaint for declaratory relief and counterclaims for trademark infringement in which it (i) denied each of plaintiff s counts in the complaint, (ii) set forth various affirmative defenses to plaintiff s claims, and (iii) asserted by way of counterclaim claims for trademark infringement and dilution arising from plaintiff s intentional use of a confusingly similar mark for the purpose of unlawfully trading upon the Company s goodwill, good name, and valuable business identity.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	On December 20, 2012, the Court held a Rule 16 scheduling conference.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	On December 21, 2012, plaintiff filed its first request for production of documents and things to the Company and plaintiff s first set of interrogatories to the Company.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S2	On February 1, 2013, the Company filed its first request for production of documents directed to plaintiff.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S3	On March 8, 2013, (i) plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file its first amended complaint and its memorandum in support thereof, and (ii) the Company moved for leave to file amended counterclaims and included its memorandum in support thereof.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S4	The Company opposed plaintiff s request for leave to amend as futile, and after argument held April 3, 2013 on plaintiff s motion, the Court granted both plaintiff and the Company leave to file their amended pleadings and declared the pleadings to be filed that same day.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S5	As a consequence, plaintiff s amended complaint now asserts, in the alternative, affirmative claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition under federal law and for violation of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, and the Company s amended counterclaims now assert federal trademark infringement, false designation of origin and federal unfair competition, federal trademark dilution, federal cyberpiracy, and state law trademark infringement, unfair competition and other claims.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S6	The parties subsequently filed an agreed-upon motion for entry of a protective order, and on July 12, 2013, the Court issued an order extending the remaining dates in the action for an additional 90 days that, among other things, provides for completion of discovery by December 13, 2013.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P3_S7	As of December 18, 2013, plaintiff and the Company entered into an Agreement settling all of the claims at issue under the lawsuit and under a related proceeding pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	On December 20, 2013, the parties jointly filed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board a stipulated motion to amend applications and stipulation to withdraw oppositions.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	On December 30, 2013, the Court issued an order approving the settlement of the lawsuit with prejudice.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P5_S0	The Company is also involved in other various claims and routine litigation matters.
1096376_14_ITEM3_P5_S1	In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future years.

1096376_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Background We provide weight management products and services and offer nutritionally balanced weight loss programs designed for women, men, and seniors, as well as our Nutrisystem D program specifically designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Our programs are based on over 40 years of nutrition research and on the science of the low Glycemic Index.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network and through retail programs.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S3	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S4	For 2013, 2012 and 2011, the direct channel accounted for 92%, 96% and 95%, respectively, of total revenue compared to 3%, 3% and 4%, respectively, for QVC.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S5	During 2013, 5% of total revenue came from retail.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S6	During 2012 and 2011, 1% of total revenue came from other channels.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S7	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brand as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S8	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S9	We market our weight management system through television, print, direct mail, Internet, public relations and social media.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S10	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, total revenues, marketing per new customer, operating margins and reactivation revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P1_S11	Our mix of revenue for the direct channel can be divided into three categories.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	First, new customer revenue is all revenue within a quarter from customers joining within that quarter.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	New customer revenue is the main driver of revenue growth.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	Second, on-program revenue is all revenue from customers who joined in previous quarters but who are still within their first nine months on the program.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	Third, reactivation revenue is all revenue generated from customers who are more than nine months from their initial purchase.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	Our eCommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	We believe this flexibility is especially valuable due to the current instability in general economic conditions.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Additionally, we initiated a concerted effort to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay, and overall customer satisfaction and have recently upgraded our eCommerce platform and website.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	We are able to test new commercials and offers, as well as, improvements to our website to allow us to be more responsive to customer needs and attempt to drive conversion.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	In December 2013, we launched Nutrisystem My Way, a program tailored to the individual s metabolism, along with our Fast 5 kit, a one-week kick start that can help customers lose five pounds in their first week of dieting.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S5	The Nutrisystem My Way program uses an algorithm to estimate each customer s metabolic rate in order to create a customized program tailored to the amount of calories needed for healthy weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S6	Customers are given a meal plan and exercise suggestions and are encouraged to check in periodically with a Nutrisystem counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S7	Additionally, we introduced new 5-day Jumpstart Your Weight Loss Kits in 2013 which were available exclusively at Walmart and represent a significant departure from our traditional 28-day program.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P3_S8	This partnership with Walmart provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our program an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at an attractive price point.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	innovation; and 4) prioritization of growth initiatives.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	During 2013, we have reduced the size of the senior management team and reorganized the workforce to align around key priorities resulting in approximately $2.4 million in severance, including $696,000 of non-cash expense related to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	Gross margins have been aided by eliminating unprofitable free promotional items and process re-engineering.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	These positive margin items have been partially offset by a $5.0 million charge recorded in 2013 to settle certain disputes that had arisen with a supplier over a legacy contract.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Retail and reactivation revenue as well as the average selling price increased during 2013.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	Despite these improvements, as well as revenue growth in the second half of 2013 as compared to the comparable period of 2012, revenue remains down for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the comparable period of 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	Management considers the following accounting estimates to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S1	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S2	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S3	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S4	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of product sales revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S5	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $10.8 million, $10.4 million and $12.9 million, respectively.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S6	The returns percentage has increased primarily due to the introduction of a tiered pricing strategy in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P7_S7	The reserve for estimated returns incurred but not received and processed was $637,000 and $652,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and has been included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continually assess the quantities of inventory on hand to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	We estimate the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecasted demand and/or our ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in our customers behavior.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $725,000 and $636,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings and expectations of future taxable income and other relevant factors.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	We estimate the annual effective income tax rate at the beginning of each year and revise the estimate at each reporting period based on a number of factors including operating results, level of tax exempt interest income, charitable contributions and sales by state, among other items.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Results of Operations Revenue and expenses consist of the following components: Revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Food sales include sales of food, supplements, shipping and handling charges billed to customers and sales credits and adjustments, including product returns.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	No revenue is recorded for food products provided at no charge as part of promotions.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the products sold, including compensation related to fulfillment, the costs of outside fulfillment, incoming and outgoing shipping costs, charge card fees and packing material.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S5	Cost of products sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S6	Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S7	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S8	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S9	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S10	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S11	General and administrative expense consists of compensation for administrative, information technology, counselors, customer service and sales personnel, share-based payment arrangements for related employees, facility expenses, website development costs, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S12	Interest expense, net consists of interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness net of interest income earned on cash balances and short term investments.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P10_S13	We are subject to corporate level income taxes and record a provision for income taxes based on an estimated effective income tax rate for the year.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Overview of the Direct Channel In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the direct channel represented 92%, 96% and 95%, respectively, of our revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	Revenues through the direct channel were $327.8 million in 2013 compared to $380.8 million in 2012 and $382.8 million in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	Revenue is primarily generated through customer starts, reactivation of former customers and the customer ordering behavior, including length of time on our program and the diet program selection.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	The revenue decrease in 2013 was primarily attributable to declines in new customer starts and decreased on-program revenue partially offset by increased reactivation revenue and higher average selling prices.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Critical to increasing customer starts is our ability to deploy marketing dollars while maintaining marketing effectiveness.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	Factors influencing our marketing effectiveness include the quality of the advertisements, promotional activity by our competitors, as well as the price and availability of appropriate media.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Revenue decreased to $358.1 million in 2013 from $396.9 million in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	The revenue decline occurred primarily due to declines in new customer starts and decreased on-program revenue partially offset by increased retail and reactivation revenue and higher average selling prices.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	In 2013, direct revenue accounted for 92% of total revenue compared to 3% for QVC and 5% for retail.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	In 2012, direct revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 3% for QVC and 1% for other channels.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Cost of revenue decreased to $184.2 million in 2013 from $213.1 million in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S5	Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 48.6% in 2013 from 46.3% in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S6	The increase in the gross margin percent was primarily attributable to pricing discipline, the removal of certain promotional items and free food promotions and process re-engineering.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S7	These items offset a higher mix of lower margin products resulting from an increase in retail sales and a $5.0 million charge to settle certain disputes that had arisen with a supplier over a legacy contract.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S8	Marketing expense decreased to $95.8 million in 2013 from $111.1 million in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S9	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue decreased to 26.7% in 2013 from 28.0% in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S10	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2013 promoted the direct business.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S11	The decrease in marketing expense was attributable to decreased spending for media ($9.5 million) and for the production of television advertising ($1.4 million).
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S12	There was also a decrease in public relations ($4.9 million) primarily due to the restructuring of certain third-party marketing vendor contracts in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S13	In total, media spending was $77.4 million in 2013 and $86.9 million in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P13_S14	General and administrative expense decreased to $58.2 million in 2013 from $66.3 million in 2012 and as a percent of revenue decreased to 16.3% in 2013 from 16.7% in 2012.

1096376_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	These decreases were offset by increased compensation, benefits and temporary help of $1.8 million and new product development expenses of $371,000 due to business initiatives.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $8.9 million in 2013 from $10.7 million in 2012 as certain fixed assets for both our website and assets purchased when we relocated our corporate headquarters reached the end of their useful lives.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P14_S4	Interest expense, net, was $89,000 in 2013 compared to $2.0 million in 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P14_S5	No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility during 2013.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P14_S6	During 2012, we had outstanding borrowings and additionally, in November 2012, we terminated and replaced our then existing credit facility.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P14_S7	In connection with the termination, we wrote off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and also terminated the outstanding interest rate swap agreements resulting in a combined charge of $1.2 million.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	In 2013, we recorded an income tax expense of $3.5 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 32.3% as compared to $3.7 million of income tax benefit in 2012 with an effective tax rate of 56.7%.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The change in the effective income tax rate was due to changes in executive compensation, reductions in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations in 2013 and decreased levels of food donations which offset a charge to record a valuation allowance for charitable contributions that might not be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Revenue decreased to $396.9 million in 2012 from $401.3 million in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	selling prices partially offset by increased reactivation revenue.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	QVC revenue also decreased due to fewer shows and air time.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	In 2012, direct revenue accounted for 96% of total revenue compared to 3% for QVC and 1% for other channels.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	In 2011, direct revenue accounted for 95% of total revenue compared to 4% for QVC and 1% for other channels.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	Cost of revenue increased to $213.1 million in 2012 from $198.4 million in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S5	Gross margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 46.3% in 2012 from 50.6% in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S6	The decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the promotional inclusion of additional higher cost items with customer starts.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S7	Continued price promotions and the sale of our Nutrisystem Advanced inventory to a closeout retailer as we transitioned to the SUCCESS program also negatively impacted gross margins.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S8	Marketing expense increased to $111.1 million in 2012 from $110.9 million in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S9	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to 28.0% in 2012 from 27.6% in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S10	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2012 promoted the direct business.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S11	The increase in marketing expense was attributable to increased spending for public relations ($3.2 million) primarily due to the restructuring of certain third-party marketing vendor contracts partially offset by decreased spending in media ($1.9 million) and for the production of television advertising ($2.6 million).
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S12	In total, media spending was $86.9 million in 2012 and $88.8 million in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S13	General and administrative expense increased to $66.3 million in 2012 from $60.8 million in 2011 and as a percent of revenue increased to 16.7% in 2012 from 15.2% in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S14	The increase was primarily attributable to higher compensation, benefits and temporary help ($879,000) and increased recruiting fees ($581,000) due to the cessation of Mr. Redling s employment.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S15	In total, we recorded approximately $5.7 million in severance for Mr. Redling, including approximately $3.3 million of non-cash expense related to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S16	The increase in compensation, benefits and temporary help was partially offset by savings achieved from the workforce reduction in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S17	Also, there were increased professional and outside computer services expenses ($998,000) due to increased legal fees and increased facilities expense ($1.5 million) due mainly to charges incurred to vacate a facility.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S18	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge ($2.1 million) related to advances paid to a frozen food supplier as the supplier was in default with its bank lender and was in the process of negotiating a work out plan and exploring other strategic alternatives.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S19	Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $10.7 million in 2012 from $12.1 million in 2011 due to the normal retirement of assets during 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P17_S20	Interest expense, net, was $2.0 million in 2012 compared to $468,000 in 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	In November 2012, we terminated and replaced our then existing credit facility.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	In connection with the termination, we wrote off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and also terminated the outstanding interest rate swap agreements resulting in a combined charge of $1.2 million.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	Additionally, interest rates increased during 2012 as compared to 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	In 2012, we recorded an income tax benefit of $3.7 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 56.7% as compared to $6.4 million of income tax expense in 2011 with an effective tax rate of 34.3%.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	The change in the effective income tax rate was due to favorable book to tax differences including the elimination of the limitation on executive compensation deductions, reductions in tax reserves and increased food donations combined with lower pre-tax income levels which resulted in income tax benefits.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	As of December 31, 2013, our principal commitments consisted of obligations under supply agreements with food vendors, an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, agreements with our internet and networking providers, operating leases and employment contracts.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P19_S1	Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate continuing requirements for capital expenditures.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Following is a summary of our contractual obligations.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	We have entered into supply agreements with various food vendors.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	Several of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Purchase obligations may vary depending on product mix.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S2	Several agreements require us to purchase specified percentages of our annual requirements for certain products.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S3	Those commitments have not been estimated and are not included in the above table.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S4	We anticipate that we will meet all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S5	We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S6	At December 31, 2013, we had working capital of $21.8 million, a decrease of $9.6 million from the $31.4 million working capital balance at December 31, 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S7	Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 were $9.8 million, a decrease of $6.4 million from the balance of $16.2 million at December 31, 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S8	In addition, we had $16.6 million invested in short term investments at December 31, 2013 as compared to $3.2 million at December 31, 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P22_S9	Our principal sources of liquidity during 2013 were cash flows from operations.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	On November 8, 2012, we entered into a $40.0 million secured revolving credit facility, as amended, with a lender.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S1	The credit facility provides for interest on borrowings at either a base rate or a London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin and is also subject to an unused fee payable quarterly.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S2	The credit facility contains financial and other covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a minimum consolidated liquidity ratio, and includes limitations on, among other things, capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, acquisitions, stock repurchases and restrictions on paying dividends in certain circumstances.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S3	The credit facility can be drawn upon through November 8, 2015, at which time all amounts must be repaid.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S4	There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S5	In 2013, we generated cash flow of $35.4 million from operating activities, an increase of $12.6 million from 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S6	The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to the net income in 2013 compared to a net loss in 2012 and changes in operating assets and liabilities.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S7	In 2013, net cash used in investing activities was $21.0 million primarily from capital additions of $7.6 million and $13.4 million of net purchases of short term investments.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P23_S8	We are continuing to invest in our ecommerce and web platform to incorporate new product initiatives.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	In 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $20.8 million, a decrease of $30.6 million from 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	During 2012, we repaid $30.0 million outstanding under our previous credit facility.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.175 per share, which were paid on March 25, 2013, May 23, 2013, August 19, 2013 and November 18, 2013.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share payable on March 20, 2014 to stockholders of record as of March 10, 2014.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Although we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to quarterly determination by our Board of Directors following its review of our financial performance.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	We believe that our available capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations and dividends for the foreseeable future.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is strongest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter.
1096376_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet and the price and availability of certain media.
1096376_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2013 of $9.8 million were maintained in bank and money market accounts.
1096376_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Additionally, we invested $16.6 million in short term investments, which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As such, a change in interest rates of 1 percentage point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows.
1096376_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Controls and Procedures The SEC defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.

(the Company or Nutrisystem ), a provider of weight management products and services, offers nutritionally balanced weight loss programs designed for women, men, and seniors, as well as the Nutrisystem D program, specifically designed to help people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P11_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets and liabilities of Nutrisystem, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P13_S0	Short term investments consist of investments in government and agency securities, corporate debt securities and time deposits with original maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P13_S1	The Company classifies these investments as available-for-sale securities.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P13_S2	These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P14_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2013, 2012 or 2011.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P15_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P15_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P15_S4	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $725 and $636 at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P16_S0	Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P17_S0	Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally two to seven years.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P18_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P18_S1	Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P19_S0	Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development incurred during the application development stage.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P19_S1	Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally two to five years.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P20_S0	Costs incurred related to planning or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are charged to expense as incurred.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P21_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P21_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P21_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P21_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P22_S0	As of December 31, 2013, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P23_S0	Derivative Instruments Interest rate swap agreements, a type of financial derivative instrument, have been utilized by the Company to reduce interest rate risk on credit facility borrowings.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P23_S1	The Company designated and accounted for its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable-rate debt.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P23_S2	The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged transactions affected earnings.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P23_S3	To the extent that the change in value of the derivative did not perfectly offset the change in value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P24_S0	There were no interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2013 and 2012.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P25_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from direct to consumer product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is upon transfer of title to the product.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P25_S1	Recognition of revenue upon shipment meets the revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P25_S2	The Company also sells prepaid program cards to wholesalers and retailers.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P25_S3	Revenue from these cards is recognized after the card is redeemed online at the Company s website or via telephone by the customer and the product is shipped to the customer.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P25_S4	Revenue from the retail programs is recognized when the product is received at the seller s location.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P25_S5	Deferred revenue consists primarily of unredeemed prepaid gift cards and unshipped frozen foods.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P26_S0	When a customer orders the frozen program, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P26_S1	The first shipment contains Nutrisystem s standard shelf-stable food.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P26_S2	The second shipment contains the frozen foods and is generally delivered within a week of a customer s order.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P26_S3	Both shipments qualify as separate units of accounting and the fair value is based on estimated selling prices of both units.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P27_S0	Direct to consumer customers may return unopened shelf-stable products within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P27_S1	Frozen products are non-returnable and non-refundable unless the order is canceled within 14 days of delivery.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P27_S2	Estimated returns are accrued at the time the sale is recognized and actual returns are tracked monthly.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company outsources 100% of its fulfillment operations to a third party provider and more than 95% of its orders are shipped by one third party provider.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P30_S0	Vendor Rebates One of the Company s suppliers provides for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P30_S1	The Company accounts for this rebate on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percentage determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the vendor.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P30_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a receivable from the vendor with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory, and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P30_S3	The rebate period is June 1 through May 31 of each year.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P30_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company reduced cost of revenue by $1,068, $1,496 and $1,401, respectively, for these rebates.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P33_S0	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the direct mailing and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P33_S1	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P33_S2	Typically, this period falls within 40 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P33_S3	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P33_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, $1,010 and $1,998, respectively, of costs have been prepaid for future advertisements and promotions.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P36_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P36_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P36_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P37_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P37_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P37_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P37_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P37_S4	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense, net.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P38_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P39_S0	Earnings Per Share The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P40_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P40_S1	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P40_S2	Undistributed losses are not allocated to unvested restricted stock as the restricted stockholders are not obligated to share in the losses.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P41_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:
1096376_14_ITEM15_P42_S0	In 2012, diluted loss per common share is identical to basic loss per common share as the Company was in a net loss position and the impact of including common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P42_S1	In 2013, 2012 and 2011, common stock equivalents representing 786, 1,637 and 657 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P43_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P44_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P44_S1	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P44_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P44_S3	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (derived service period for market-based restricted stock unit awards), net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P44_S4	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P45_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options, granting of restricted stock or vesting of restricted stock units.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P45_S1	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $2,842, $1,250 and $6,049 in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P46_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2013-11 which provides that an unrecognized tax benefit, or portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P46_S1	If an applicable deferred tax asset is not available or the tax law does not require the company to use and the company does not expect to use the applicable deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability in the financial statements and should not be combined with an unrelated deferred tax asset.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P47_S0	ASU 2013-11 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P47_S1	The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date; however, retrospective application is permitted.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P47_S2	The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P48_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P48_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P51_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P51_S1	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P51_S2	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P52_S0	The fair values of the Company s Level 1 instruments are based on quoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P57_S0	The Company has used interest rate swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument, to manage interest costs and minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations on cash flows associated with its variable-rate debt.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P57_S1	The Company did not use interest rate derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P58_S0	While interest rate swaps are subject to fluctuations in value, these fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company minimized the risk of credit loss by entering into these agreements with financial institutions that have high credit ratings.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P59_S1	In January and June 2012, respectively, the Company entered into two separate $10,000 notional value forward-starting interest rate swaps.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P60_S0	The objective of the hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments for $20,000 of floating rate debt.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P60_S1	The swaps were terminated and expensed during 2012 upon the termination of a previous $100,000 credit facility and repayment of outstanding borrowings thereunder.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P62_S0	Litigation On March 6, 2012, in response to the filing by a competitor of numerous trademark applications containing the term NUTRILITE in various weight-loss and weight-management classes, the Company sent a cease and desist letter to the competitor claiming that its use of such mark is very similar to the Company s NUTRISYSTEM mark for very similar Company goods and services in the weight-loss and weight-management industries.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P62_S1	The Company alleged that such use would result in confusion amongst consumers with respect to the source of such goods and services and would constitute an infringement of the Company s mark in violation of the Trademark Act of 1946 (the Lanham Act), as well as various other federal and state laws governing trademarks, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices, and would likely cause dilution of the Company s famous and distinctive mark.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P63_S0	On March 16, 2012, the competitor responded to such letter by filing a complaint for declaratory relief against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan (listed under docket number 1:12-cv-00256-RHB) asking the Court to declare that plaintiff s use and registration of its mark does not (i) constitute trademark infringement, federal unfair competition, federal dilution, (ii) violate certain Michigan statutes; and (iii) constitute common law trademark infringement or common law unfair competition.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P63_S1	On April 27, 2012, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P63_S2	On May 29, 2012, plaintiff filed its brief in opposition to the Company s motion to dismiss the complaint, and on June 15, 2012 the Company filed its reply brief in support of its motion to dismiss the complaint.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P63_S3	On October 9, 2012, the Court denied the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P64_S0	On October 23, 2012, the Company filed its answer and affirmative defenses to plaintiff s complaint for declaratory relief and counterclaims for trademark infringement in which it (i) denied each of plaintiff s counts in the complaint, (ii) set forth various affirmative defenses to plaintiff s claims, and (iii) asserted by way of counterclaim claims for trademark infringement and dilution arising from plaintiff s intentional use of a confusingly similar mark for the purpose of unlawfully trading upon the Company s goodwill, good name, and valuable business identity.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P65_S0	On December 20, 2012, the Court held a Rule 16 scheduling conference.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P65_S1	On December 21, 2012, plaintiff filed its first request for production of documents and things to the Company and plaintiff s first set of interrogatories to the Company.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P65_S2	On February 1, 2013, the Company filed its first request for production of documents directed to plaintiff.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P65_S3	On March 8, 2013, (i) plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file its first amended complaint and its memorandum in support thereof, and (ii) the Company moved for leave to file amended counterclaims and included its memorandum in support thereof.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P65_S4	The Company opposed plaintiff s request for leave to amend as futile, and after argument held April 3, 2013 on plaintiff s motion, the Court granted both plaintiff and the Company leave to file their amended pleadings and declared the pleadings to be filed that same day.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P65_S5	As a consequence, plaintiff s amended complaint now asserts, in the alternative, affirmative claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition under federal law and for violation of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, and the Company s amended counterclaims now assert federal trademark infringement, false designation of origin and federal unfair competition, federal trademark dilution, federal cyberpiracy, and state law trademark infringement, unfair competition and other claims.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P65_S6	The parties subsequently filed an agreed-upon motion for entry of a protective order, and on July 12, 2013, the Court issued an order extending the remaining dates in the action for an additional 90 days that, among other things, provides for completion of discovery by December 13, 2013.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P72_S0	INCOME TAXES Income tax expense (benefit) consist of the following: A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows:
1096376_14_ITEM15_P73_S0	The change in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was due to the changes in executive compensation, decreased levels of food donations and the reduction in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations which offset a charge to record a valuation allowance for charitable contributions carryforwards that might not be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P73_S1	The change in the effective tax rate from 2011 to 2012 was due to favorable book to tax differences including the elimination of the limitation on executive compensation deductions due to the nonrenewal of an executive s employment agreement in April 2012, reductions in tax reserves and increased food donations combined with lower pre-tax income levels resulted in income tax benefits for 2012 versus expense for 2011.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P74_S0	The significant items comprising the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows: At December 31, 2013, the net deferred tax asset of $7,194 is comprised of $931 included in current assets and $6,263 included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P74_S1	At December 31, 2012, the net deferred tax asset of $5,920 is comprised of $2,969 included in current assets and $2,951 included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P74_S3	The increase from 2012 to 2013 is due to the release of a tax reserve due to the lapse of the statute of limitations.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P75_S0	For state tax purposes, there is a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in a given year to offset state taxable income.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P75_S1	Net operating losses will begin to expire in 2025.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P76_S0	In 2013, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $800 against its deferred tax asset generated for charitable contributions.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P76_S1	The Company recorded the valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount it expects is more likely than not to be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P76_S2	Based on the projected level of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the remaining net deferred tax assets.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P77_S0	An analysis of the activity of the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2013 is as follows:

1096376_14_ITEM15_P78_S5	State tax jurisdictions that remain open to examination range from 2010 through 2013.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P78_S6	The Company does not believe that that there will be any material changes to unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P79_S0	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the total unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:
1096376_14_ITEM15_P80_S0	Equity Incentive Plans The Company has three equity incentive plans: the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the Equity Incentive Plans ).

1096376_14_ITEM15_P80_S5	Under each of the plans, the Board of Directors determines the term of each award, but no award can be exercisable more than 10 years from the date the award is granted.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P80_S6	To date, all of the stock options issued under the Equity Incentive Plans expire between seven and 10 years from the grant date.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P80_S7	The Board also determines the vesting provisions of all awards and the exercise price per share of stock options issued under the plans, which is the fair market value at date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P80_S8	Awards issued to employees generally vest over terms ranging from two to five years.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P80_S9	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity for 2011, 2012 and 2013:
1096376_14_ITEM15_P81_S0	In May 2013, the Company determined that 40 stock options granted in 2012 were void as they exceeded a per person annual award limit and entered into a corrected stock option agreement with respect to those stock options.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P81_S1	The change did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements but did reduce the number of stock options outstanding as of January 1, 2013.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P81_S2	In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded compensation charges of $382, $1,163 and $150, respectively, for stock option awards.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P81_S3	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $1.61, $1.96 and $4.50, respectively.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P81_S4	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $7, $67 and $204, respectively.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P82_S0	The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:
1096376_14_ITEM15_P83_S0	In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company authorized the issuance of 50, 43 and 30 fully vested shares of common stock, respectively, as compensation to the Board of Directors resulting in compensation expense of $455 in each year.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P83_S1	In addition, in 2012 and 2011, the Company issued a total of 22 and 125 shares of common stock, respectively, to non-employees for services.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P83_S2	No shares were issued to non-employees during 2013, although the shares issued in 2012 vested during 2013 resulting in expense upon vesting.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P83_S3	Costs recognized for shares issued to non-employees for services were $195, $573 and $841 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and approximated fair value.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P84_S0	The Company has issued restricted stock to employees generally with vesting terms ranging from two to five years.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P84_S1	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P85_S0	Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P85_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for 2011, 2012 and 2013:
1096376_14_ITEM15_P85_S2	Additionally, the Company grants performance-based and market-based restricted stock units.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P85_S3	The performance-based units have performance conditions and service-based vesting conditions.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P85_S4	Each vesting tranche is treated as an individual award and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P85_S5	The requisite service period is a combination of the performance period and the subsequent vesting period based on continued service.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P86_S0	units that ultimately vest to range from 0% to 150% of the original units granted, which is reflected as performance factor adjustment in the table below.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company recognizes expense ratably over the vesting period for performance-based restricted stock units when it is probable that the performance criteria specified will be achieved.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P88_S0	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P89_S0	In 2012, grants of restricted stock units contained market-based conditions.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P89_S1	Market-based awards entitle employees to vest in a number of units determined by the Company s stock price return as compared to a set of comparator companies over a period, and will range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P89_S2	The fair value is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P89_S3	Compensation expense is recognized over the derived service periods using the straight-line method regardless of the outcome of the market conditions, so long as the award holder remains an employee through the requisite service period.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P90_S0	These awards contained different measurement periods.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P91_S0	The fair value of the market-based restricted stock units utilized the following inputs and assumptions: The performance period starting price is measured as the average closing price over the last 20 trading days prior to the performance period start.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P91_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock unit activity:
1096376_14_ITEM15_P92_S0	The Company recorded compensation expense of $4,800, $7,721 and $8,312 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, in connection with the issuance of the restricted shares and restricted stock units.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P93_S0	As of December 31, 2013, 656 shares of restricted stock and 224 restricted stock units were expected to vest.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P95_S0	As of December 31, 2013, there was $7,935 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements, including market-based units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P95_S1	The total unrecognized compensation expense will be fully recognized as expense through the third quarter of 2017.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P98_S0	The sum of the quarterly basic and diluted per share amounts may not equal amounts reported for the year.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P98_S1	This is due to the effects of rounding and changes in weighted average shares outstanding for each period.
1096376_14_ITEM15_P99_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company recorded a charge of $2,476 to restructure certain third party marketing vendor contracts, a charge of $1,980 to vacate a facility and a charge of $1,079 to write off unamortized debt issuance costs.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P151_S0	Exhibit 32.2 Statement of Chief Financial Officer Pursuant to Section 1350 of Title 18 of the United States Code Pursuant to Section 1350 of Title 18 of the United States Code as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the undersigned, Michael P.

1096376_14_ITEM15_P152_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	Nutrisystem, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Nutrisystem, the Company, we, us, or our ) is a provider of weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs, multi-day kits available at retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	Typically, our program customers purchase monthly food packages containing a 28-day supply of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and desserts, which they supplement with fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	Most of our customers order on an auto-delivery basis ( Auto-Delivery ), where we send a 28-day food supply on an ongoing basis until notified of a customer s cancellation.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	We offer our pre-selected favorites food pack or personalized plans where customers can hand pick their entire menu or customize plans to their dietary preference.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P0_S4	Our meal plans feature more than 150 menu options at different price points including frozen and ready-to-go entrees, desserts, snacks and shakes.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P0_S5	Additionally, we offer comprehensive individualized counseling options from trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators and provide further support through our digital tools.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P0_S6	Our program is based on the following cornerstones that represent who we are to our customers:
1096376_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Nutrisystem program has helped millions of people lose weight successfully over our 40-plus year history.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	Our program is portioned for weight loss and is nutritionally balanced to meet national dietary guidelines.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	We also offer transition and maintenance plans, which include personalized menu options selected by our customer (e.g., only dinner entrees) as well as continued counseling support and access to Nutrisystem s digital tools.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	These plans are designed to help our customers keep the weight off.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Nutrisystem program is based on more than 40 years of nutrition research and the science of the low Glycemic Index, and offers portion-controlled items that include relatively higher amounts of fiber, contain good carbohydrates and zero trans fats.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Foods on the lower end of the Glycemic Index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P3_S2	In addition, as of May 2014, we removed artificial flavors and sweeteners from all breakfasts, lunches, dessert bars and bakery items.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Nutrisystem sells its weight management program primarily through a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution approach using the Internet and telephone.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P4_S1	Our customers can place orders 24 hours a day, seven days a week on our website, www.nutrisystem.com , and the food is shipped directly to our customers doors.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P4_S2	Our customers can either choose our pre-selected favorites food pack or personalize their monthly food orders for their specific tastes or dietary needs.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P4_S3	Our program does not require customers to visit centers, measure foods or count calories.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P4_S4	The entrees are individually packaged and food preparation time is minimal.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet and telephone provides the convenience and privacy that our customers value.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	In addition, we provide online and telephone counseling and support to our customers using trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and other nutrition and dietary staff, and as a result, our customers do not need to travel for a face-to-face meeting.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	We believe we are very competitively priced within the weight management industry and provide a compelling value proposition to our customers which includes a selection of more than 150 food items, expert guides, tools, including NuMi, our digital product that integrates with wearable fitness devices and health platforms, and access to trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and other nutrition and dietary staff.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	We do not charge membership fees.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	Various promotional offers and pricing are offered throughout the year.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe our program, kits and digital tools offer consumers a sensible approach to losing weight without the use of faddish, unhealthy or unrealistic weight loss methods by educating them about proper portion size, as well as the appropriate combinations of fiber, protein, good carbohydrates and fat.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths:
1096376_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using our program.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Our customer research has found that customers lost an average of 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and tended to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	Our research indicates overall satisfaction with our program and a potential willingness on the part of our customers to refer the Nutrisystem program to others.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P8_S3	We have also sponsored clinical trials at leading academic centers in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P8_S4	Statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control) were observed, in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	We believe that our brand is well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	Our company and our predecessors have been in the weight management industry for more than 40 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we generate revenue in our direct channel through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards).
1096376_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P11_S2	We also minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment: we outsource the production of our food products to a number of vendors and we outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations to a third-party provider.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	We also generate revenue through the sale of our products and kits at retail locations.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	These products and kits represent a significant departure from our traditional 28-day program and have expanded our products and consumer reach.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our program an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at an attractive price point.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight management program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our customers primarily place their orders through the Internet or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their homes.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets, which rely on weight-loss centers, cannot ensure.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	Additionally, we provide our customers with a package of food, including daily breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert, which removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	We believe our weight management program offers our customers significant value and is priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P13_S5	In addition, we do not charge a membership fee, as opposed to many of our competitors.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S., as well as the global population.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	The World Health Organization has stated that worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980 and estimated that in 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults, 18 years and older, were overweight and over 600 million of these were obese.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our clinical trial results suggest and analyses of real world customer results confirm that people who stay on the Nutrisystem program for at least three months have a high probability of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	In addition to the health risks, there are also cultural implications for those who are overweight or obese.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	U.S. consumers are inundated with imagery in media, fashion and entertainment that depicts the thin body as the ideal body type.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	Studies suggest that there is rampant discrimination against people with obesity.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Despite the high percentage of overweight and obese individuals in the U.S., the popularity of dieting appears to indicate consumers desire to be thin.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as well as medically supervised programs.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	Our identified peers and competitors include, but are not limited to, Atkins Nutritionals, Inc., eDiets.com, Jenny Craig, Medifast, Inc. and Weight Watchers International, Inc.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight loss industry.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P20_S3	By providing a well-recognized food-based weight management program using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P20_S4	Our Products and Services For more than 40 years, the Nutrisystem name has been recognized as a leader in the weight loss industry.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P20_S5	We provide a comprehensive weight management program, consisting primarily of a pre-packaged food program, digital tools and counseling.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Typically, our customers purchase monthly food packages of frozen and ready-to-go food containing 28 days of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and desserts, which they supplement with fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Most customers order through our Auto-Delivery feature.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	Trained counselors are available to answer questions and make recommendations to help each customer achieve and maintain his or her weight loss goal.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	Customers support and encourage each other and share information online and via Nutrisystem social media channels.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P21_S4	These services are complemented with relevant information on diet, nutrition and physical activity, including a personalized My Daily 3 physical activity program and expert guides with tips to help customers succeed on the program.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P21_S5	Additionally, NuMi, our digital product that integrates with wearable fitness devices and health platforms, is offered to our customers free of charge.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	Our Nutrisystem program consists of more than 150 portion-controlled items that serve as the foundation of a low Glycemic Index diet.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	protein and fat that meets national dietary guidelines.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	We have also worked to reduce the sodium content of our meal program.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P23_S2	Including grocery additions to supplement our meals, our plans contain 1800-2200 milligrams of sodium per day, consistent with national guidelines, and tailored versions of the plans are available that deliver as low as 1500 mg/day.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P23_S3	In contrast, the average American consumes 2800-4000 milligrams of sodium per day.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P23_S4	In addition, as of May 2014, we removed artificial flavors and sweeteners from all breakfasts, lunches, dessert bars and bakery items.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	We constantly strive to meet or exceed nutritional guidelines as they are updated.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	We offer a customizable program, along with our Fast 5+ kit, a one-week starter kit that can help customers lose five pounds plus one inch off of their waist in their first week of dieting.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	A large and growing body of scientific evidence suggests a key predictor of long-term weight loss success is quick, early results, which Fast 5+ is designed to deliver.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	Fast 5+ includes seven days of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, plus all-new shakes with formulations for men and women to meet their unique nutritional needs.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	As part of our program, customers are given a meal plan and exercise suggestions and are encouraged to check in periodically with a Nutrisystem counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	Our program delivers a combination of portion-controlled foods and an eating plan based on slow digesting carbohydrates and fiber, designed to help keep blood sugar levels stable throughout the day, minimizing hunger spikes and the feelings of deprivation that cause cravings.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	Additionally, Nutrisystem s 5-day Weight Loss Kits are available at select retailers and represent a significant departure from our traditional 28-day program.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S4	We offer a core 5-day kit, a D kit targeted to individuals with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes, as well as SmartCarb and PowerFuel products including blueberry muffins, cinnamon buns, vanilla shakes, chocolate shakes and chocolate chip cookie packs, designed to complement the D kit.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S5	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our program an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at an attractive price point.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S6	We are seeing repeat business as well as multiple kit purchases, indicating that customers are seeing results or enlisting other family members to diet with them.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S7	Also, we continue to offer our program at Costco through the use of prepaid program cards and gift cards.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P26_S8	We are actively developing our retail product pipeline and we expect to have additional products/kits to launch in retail.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Nutrisystem D Program is a weight loss program specifically designed to produce gradual weight loss in overweight persons with, or at risk for, Type 2 diabetes.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	It provides nutrition consistent with the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Two randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed medical journals found the Nutrisystem D program, in combination with counseling sessions, produced statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in weight, HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control), and several other risk factors.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Notably, improvements in diabetes control were observed despite a reduction in diabetes medications among participants who received the Nutrisystem D intervention.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	A third study, utilizing continuous glucose monitoring technology, found improvements in blood glucose control when subjects used the Nutrisystem D program, even before the achievement of significant weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	By offering a variety of frozen and ready-to-go foods, we help our customers sustain their weight loss efforts.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	On our website, customers can order food 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P29_S2	The transition and maintenance plans allow customers the means to gradually increase their responsibility for grocery shopping and food preparation while adhering to the principles of the Nutrisystem approach.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P29_S3	These lower cost programs help extend the supportive relationship and allow time to reinforce the dietary changes that produced the initial weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P29_S4	These plans include recipes and portion-control tools in addition to a reduced number of Nutrisystem entrees delivered each month.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	The features of our weight loss program address many of the most common limitations of traditional weight loss programs, including high initiation and recurring membership fees, the inconvenience of traveling to weight loss centers for scheduled appointments and lack of privacy.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	In addition, our prepared meals provide our customers with a structured program with limited weighing and measuring of foods and no need to count calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	We believe that the convenience of home delivery, reduced grocery shopping time, the portability of the food, and rapid food preparation also aid customer compliance with our weight loss program.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our food items have accounted for 99% of our revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	No other product or service has accounted for more than 1% of our revenue in any of the last three years.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 99%, 99% and 98%, respectively, of our revenue were generated in the United States.

1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	An integrated order receipt, billing, picking, shipping and delivery tracking system comprised of proprietary and third-party components is utilized for our orders.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	This system integrates the front end, or website customer interface, with order processing and shipping, and allows customers to access shippers order tracking numbers online.

1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S6	Three are located in Pennsylvania (Allentown, Bethlehem and Chambersburg) and two in Nevada (both in Sparks).
1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S7	As of December 31, 2014, all fulfillment was being handled by one outsourced provider.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S8	We have a service agreement with our outside fulfillment provider which provides for storage, handling of frozen and ready-to-go foods and other services, including pricing and minimum space commitments.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S9	The current contract expires in 2020 but may be terminated sooner upon 180 days written notice.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S10	We believe that other outside fulfillment providers could be utilized if needed and we continually evaluate the need for secondary fulfillment services.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P41_S11	We continue to partner with our fulfillment provider to reduce the warehouse order turn-around time for processing and shipping orders.

1096376_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	These contracts may be terminated by us upon written notice, generally between 30 and 180 days, or under certain circumstances only upon a default of the vendor.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P44_S3	We anticipate meeting all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P44_S4	In 2014, approximately 17% and 14%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two vendors.

1096376_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	New foods are created to enhance the variety of our current offerings or to support the efforts of creating a new program.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	Typically, concepts are formulated in collaboration with our food manufacturers to meet our requirements for nutrition and stability.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	We then contract with these food manufacturers to produce these products based on our specifications.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	Alternatively, food manufacturers may suggest items.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste, and cost considerations.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Our Customers We offer weight loss programs designed for women, men, seniors as well as people with Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	Based on our customer research, our typical customer is female, approximately 52 years of age.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P48_S2	We believe that, on average, our customers want to lose approximately 44 pounds over a period of time.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P48_S3	Additionally, based on our customer research, we believe our typical customers tend to stay on our program for 11 to 12 weeks, lose 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and have tried other popular diet programs.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P48_S4	We believe that this research indicates a willingness to refer our program to others and that our customers value the following Nutrisystem program attributes:
1096376_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	they do not feel hungry while on the program.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Our ecommerce and community websites and our tools and trackers, all of which are based primarily on third-party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in top tier hosting facilities.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	These facilities provide redundant network connections, physical and fire security and diesel generated power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely and are intended to provide an uninterruptible power supply.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data.

1096376_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

1096376_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Risks Related to Our Business Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our marketing expenditures were $107.7 million, $95.8 million and $111.1 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Our sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our program which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment and Internet and networking services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	We rely solely on third-party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	In 2014, approximately 17% and 14%, respectively, of inventory purchases were from two vendors.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food and other products in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In 2014, more than 94% of our orders were shipped by one third-party provider and 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by one third-party provider.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access and networking, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S6	Further, if our website or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brand and loss of sales.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S7	Therefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P4_S8	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) or United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Some of our counselors for our weight management program do not have extensive training or certification in nutrition, diet or health fields and have only undergone the training they receive from us.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S4	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S6	We may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Our weight loss program does not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S9	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management program.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S10	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S11	Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S12	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S13	If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S14	Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P5_S15	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management program.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S6	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We are dependent on certain third-party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third-party retailers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products and services are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Additionally, some agreements contain exclusive rights in specified locations to promote our products during the contract term and for a specified period thereafter.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S4	If any third party elects not to renew their agreement with us or reduces the promotion of our products, our revenue will suffer.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In addition, our third-party retailers may decide to stop selling our products upon written notice, which may result in an increased level of reclamation claims as inventory held by the retailer is depleted.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S6	In the event any retailer terminates its relationship with us and the level of reclamation claims exceeds the estimated amount reserved on our balance sheet at the time of sale to the retailer, we will have to record an expense for the excess claims, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in competitive advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our program.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our website.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	A significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Additional states and governmental entities are considering such notice laws.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our website or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our website or purchasing our services or products.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	We rely on third-party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment and result in chargebacks of the fraudulently charged amounts.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S7	Furthermore, widespread credit card fraud may lessen our customers willingness to purchase our products on our website.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S8	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S9	We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S10	Our business is seasonal, with revenue generally greatest in the first quarter and weaker in the fourth quarter.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S11	The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S12	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S13	Future acquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S14	A component of our growth strategy may be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and services.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P12_S15	Even if we succeed in acquiring or building such businesses, we will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P13_S4	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P13_S5	If our brand suffers or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We use third-party marketing vendors to promote our products.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight management program.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Third parties may infringe on our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S6	We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S7	If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S8	Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S9	Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S10	In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S11	We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S12	We may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S13	Third parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P14_S14	Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S2	Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our credit agreement, as amended, contains financial and other covenants.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S4	The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Our credit agreement, as amended, contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a minimum consolidated liquidity ratio, and includes limitations on, among other things, capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, acquisitions and restrictions on paying dividends in certain circumstances.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement, as amended, may result in an event of default under the agreement.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S7	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S8	If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S9	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S10	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S11	We have not obtained life insurance on any key executive officers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S12	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S13	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P15_S15	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Risks Related to Our Industry Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Our program features pre-packaged food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P16_S7	Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our pre-packaged food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In the early 1990s, our predecessor businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	More recently, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity, and restrictions of our business operations.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In October 2009, the FTC published its revised Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising which now requires us to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our program when using a customer s weight loss testimonial in advertising.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	For example, the labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and remain unsettled.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P24_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, including dietary supplements, as well as our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenue and profits.
1096376_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	This location totals 119,767 square feet of office space and our lease expires in 2022.
1096376_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	We also had a lease in Hoboken, New Jersey which was 2,515 square feet of office space which ended in February 2015.
1096376_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our fulfillment capacity is located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_15_ITEM2_P0_S3	We have no lease obligations to any of our outsourced fulfillment providers; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.

1096376_15_ITEM6_P4_S2	Accordingly, the operating results of this discontinued operation have been presented separately from continuing operations for all periods presented.
1096376_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	The loss on discontinued operations during 2010 was primarily from operations.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs, multi-day kits available at retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The weight loss programs are designed for women, men, and seniors.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Additionally, our Nutrisystem D program is designed specifically to help people with Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	Our programs are based on more than 40 years of nutrition research and the science of the low Glycemic Index.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network and select retailers.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S5	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S6	For 2014, 2013 and 2012, the direct channel accounted for 91%, 92% and 96%, respectively, of revenue compared to 2%, 3% and 3%, respectively, for QVC.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S8	During 2012, 1% of revenue came from other channels.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S9	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brand as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S10	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S11	We market our weight management system through television, print, direct mail, Internet, public relations and social media.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S12	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, total revenue, marketing per new customer, operating margins and reactivation revenue.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P0_S13	Our mix of revenue for the direct channel can be divided into three categories.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	First, new customer revenue is all revenue within a quarter from customers joining within that quarter.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	New customer revenue is the main driver of revenue growth.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Second, on-program revenue is all revenue from customers who joined in previous quarters but who are still within their first nine months on the program.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P1_S3	Third, reactivation revenue is all revenue generated from customers who are more than nine months from their initial purchase.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	Our ecommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	We believe this flexibility is especially valuable as it allows us to react to changing market conditions relatively quickly.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	Additionally, we are continuously looking to make investments to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay, and overall customer satisfaction.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	We are able to test new commercials, offers and website configurations to allow us to be more responsive to customer needs and attempt to drive conversion.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	We offer a customizable program, along with our Fast 5+ kit, a one-week starter kit that can help customers lose five pounds plus one inch off their waist in their first week of dieting.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	Customers are given a meal plan and exercise suggestions and are encouraged to check in periodically with a Nutrisystem counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S6	Additionally, Nutrisystem s 5-day Weight Loss Kits are available at select retailers and represent a significant departure from our traditional 28-day program.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S7	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our program an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at an attractive price point.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S8	We are actively developing our retail product pipeline and expect additional products/kits to launch in retail.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P2_S9	We believe these new product and program innovations are resonating well with our customers.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	Revenue for 2014 increased 13% from 2013 to $403.1 million.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	retail revenue, which offset decreased reactivation and QVC revenue.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	Retail revenue growth was primarily from an increase in the number of stores carrying our product and expanded product offerings.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	On-program revenue increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 as it benefited from the increase of new customers, partially offset by a decline in the number of paid days a customer stayed on the program.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	Additionally, we had a higher average selling price in 2014 as compared to 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P4_S4	Reactivation revenue decreased as a result of the decline of new customer starts in previous years and QVC revenue decreased due to fewer shows and air time.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Management considers the following accounting estimates to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S3	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S4	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of product sales revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S5	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $12.7 million, $10.8 million and $10.4 million, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S6	The returns percentage has increased primarily due to the increase in revenue and the tiered pricing strategy.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P6_S7	The reserve for estimated returns incurred but not received and processed was $762,000 and $637,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and has been included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	We continually assess the quantities of inventory on hand to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	We estimate the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecasted demand and/or our ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in our customers behavior.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $460,000 and $725,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P8_S2	We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings and expectations of future taxable income and other relevant factors.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P8_S3	At both December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had a valuation allowance of $800,000 recorded against our deferred tax asset generated for charitable contributions.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P8_S4	We estimate the annual effective income tax rate at the beginning of each year and revise the estimate at each reporting period based on a number of factors including operating results, level of tax exempt interest income, charitable contributions and sales by state, among other items.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P9_S8	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P9_S9	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P9_S10	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P9_S11	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P9_S12	General and administrative expense consists of compensation for administrative, information technology, counselors, customer service and sales personnel, share-based payment arrangements for related employees, facility expenses, website development costs, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P11_S2	Revenue is primarily generated through customer starts, reactivation of former customers and the customer ordering behavior, including length of time on our program and the diet program selection.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P11_S3	The revenue increase in 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in new customers and on-program revenue, which offset decreased reactivation revenue from the decline of new customer starts in previous years.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P11_S4	We experienced a positive response to new product offerings and messaging resulting in an increase in new customers.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P11_S5	On-program revenue increased in 2014 as compared to 2013 as it benefited from the increase of new customers, partially offset by a decline in the number of paid days a customer stayed on the program.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P11_S6	Additionally, we had a higher average selling price in 2014 as compared 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Critical to increasing customer starts is our ability to deploy marketing dollars while maintaining marketing effectiveness.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	Factors influencing our marketing effectiveness include the quality of the advertisements, promotional activity by our competitors, as well as the price and availability of appropriate media.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	Revenue increased to $403.1 million in 2014 from $358.1 million in 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to an increase in new customers, retail and on-program revenue that was slightly offset by decreased reactivation and QVC revenue.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Additionally, we had a higher average selling price in 2014 as compared to 2013.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S7	The increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to selling price increases partially offset by an increase in certain promotional items.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S8	Additionally, 2013 was negatively impacted by a $5.0 million charge recorded to settle certain disputes that had arisen with a supplier over a legacy contract.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S12	The increase in marketing expense was attributable to increased spending for media ($11.9 million) and public relations ($368,000).
1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S13	Slightly offsetting these increases was a decrease in marketing consulting ($352,000).

1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S16	The increased spending is due to higher compensation and benefits ($1.3 million) reflecting increased call center commissions and labor costs for key initiatives and increased spending in miscellaneous taxes ($262,000).
1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S17	These increases were partially offset by decreased professional, outside and computer services expenses ($390,000), decreased new packaging expense ($274,000).
1096376_15_ITEM7_P13_S18	Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to $7.8 million in 2014 from $8.9 million in 2013 as certain fixed assets for our website and assets purchased when we relocated our corporate headquarters reached the end of their useful lives.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	The change in the effective income tax rate was due to changes in executive compensation, decreased levels of food donations and the reduction in tax reserves during 2013 due to the lapse of the statute of limitations which offset a charge to record a valuation allowance for charitable contributions recorded in 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	Revenue decreased to $358.1 million in 2013 from $396.9 million in 2012.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P15_S6	The increase in the gross margin percent was primarily attributable to pricing discipline, the removal of certain promotional items and free food promotions and process re-engineering.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P15_S7	These items offset a higher mix of lower margin products resulting from an increase in retail sales and a $5.0 million charge to settle certain disputes that had arisen with a supplier over a legacy contract.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	The decrease was primarily attributable to lower non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements of $3.6 million due to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards in 2012 as certain employees terminated, a decrease in facilities expense of $2.5 million due to a charge incurred in 2012 to vacate a facility and an impairment charge of $2.1 million recorded in 2012 related to advances paid to a frozen food supplier.

1096376_15_ITEM7_P16_S9	No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility during 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P16_S10	During 2012, we had outstanding borrowings and additionally, in November 2012, we terminated and replaced our then existing credit facility.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P16_S11	In connection with the termination, we wrote off the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and also terminated the outstanding interest rate swap agreements resulting in a combined charge of $1.2 million.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	In 2013, we recorded an income tax expense of $3.5 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 32.3%, as compared to $3.7 million of income tax benefit in 2012 with an effective tax rate of 56.7%.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The change in the effective income tax rate was due to changes in executive compensation, reductions in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations in 2013 and decreased levels of food donations which offset a charge to record a valuation allowance for charitable contributions that might not be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2014, our principal commitments consisted of obligations under supply agreements with food vendors, an agreement with our outside fulfillment provider, agreements with our internet and networking providers, operating leases and employment contracts.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate continuing requirements for capital expenditures.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	Following is a summary of our contractual obligations.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	We have entered into supply agreements with various food vendors.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	Several of these agreements provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, as well as exclusivity in the production of certain products, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Purchase obligations may vary depending on product mix.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	One agreement also provides for certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	purchase specified percentages of our annual requirements for certain products.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Those commitments have not been estimated and are not included in the above table.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	We anticipate that we will meet all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	At December 31, 2014, we had working capital of $24.8 million, an increase of $3.0 million from the $21.8 million working capital balance at December 31, 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S5	Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 were $12.6 million, an increase of $2.8 million from the balance of $9.8 million at December 31, 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S6	In addition, we had $16.6 million invested in short term investments at both December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P21_S7	Our principal sources of liquidity during 2014 were cash flows from operations.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	On November 8, 2012, we entered into a $40.0 million secured revolving credit facility, as amended, with a lender.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	The credit facility provides for interest on borrowings at either a base rate or the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin and is also subject to an unused fee payable quarterly.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	The credit facility contains financial and other covenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and a minimum consolidated liquidity ratio, and includes limitations on, among other things, capital expenditures, additional indebtedness, acquisitions and restrictions on paying dividends in certain circumstances.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	The credit facility can be drawn upon through November 8, 2015, at which time all amounts must be repaid.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	In 2014, we generated cash flow of $32.8 million from operating activities, a decrease of $2.6 million from 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S6	The decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in receivables and the timing of accrued payroll and benefits, largely offset by an increase in net income.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S7	In 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $8.4 million primarily from capital additions of $8.3 million.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P22_S8	We are continuing to invest in our ecommerce and web platform to incorporate new product initiatives and on our digital tools.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	In 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $21.6 million primarily for the payment of dividends.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.175 per share, which were paid on March 20, 2014, May 22, 2014, August 18, 2014 and November 24, 2014.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	Subsequent to December 31, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share payable on March 23, 2015 to stockholders of record as of March 12, 2015.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	Although we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends, the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to quarterly determination by our Board of Directors following its review of our financial performance.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	We believe that our available capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations and dividends for the foreseeable future.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth calendar quarter.
1096376_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.
1096376_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 of $12.6 million were maintained in bank and money market accounts.
1096376_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	Additionally, we invested $16.6 million in short term investments, which are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	As such, a change in interest rates of 1 percentage point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Controls and Procedures The SEC defines the term disclosure controls and procedures to mean a company s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based on the evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures by our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period covered by this report were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s financial reporting.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company s financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to maintaining records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the Company s financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made in accordance with management and board of director authorization; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.

1096376_15_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P6_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P6_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P6_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P6_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1096376_15_ITEM9A_P7_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P9_S0	BACKGROUND Nature of the Business Nutrisystem, Inc. (the Company or Nutrisystem ) is a provider of weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs, multi-day kits available at retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P9_S1	The weight loss programs are designed for women, men, and seniors.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P9_S2	Additionally, the Nutrisystem D program is specifically designed to help people with Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P9_S3	The Nutrisystem programs are based on over 40 years of nutrition research and on the science of the low glycemic index.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P10_S0	The Company s pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network, and select retailers.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P10_S1	Approximately 99%, 99% and 98% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, were generated in the United States.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P11_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets and liabilities of Nutrisystem, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P12_S0	Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments Cash equivalents include only securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P12_S1	At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, demand accounts and money market accounts comprised all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P13_S0	Short term investments consist of investments in government and agency securities and corporate debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P13_S1	The Company classifies these investments as available-for-sale securities.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P13_S2	These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P14_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P14_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2014, 2013 or 2012.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P15_S0	Inventories Inventories consist principally of packaged food held in outside fulfillment locations.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P15_S1	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P15_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P15_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P15_S4	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $460 and $725 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P16_S0	Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P17_S0	Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally two to seven years.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P18_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P18_S1	Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P19_S0	Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development incurred during the application development stage.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P19_S1	Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally two to five years.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P20_S0	Costs incurred related to planning or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are charged to expense as incurred.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P20_S1	The net book value of capitalized software was $13,162 and $11,473 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P21_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P21_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P21_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P21_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P22_S0	As of December 31, 2014, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P23_S0	Derivative Instruments Interest rate swap agreements, a type of financial derivative instrument, have been utilized by the Company to reduce interest rate risk on credit facility borrowings.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P23_S1	The Company designated and accounted for its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable-rate debt.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P23_S2	The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the periods during which the hedged transactions affected earnings.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P23_S3	To the extent that the change in value of the derivative did not perfectly offset the change in value of the items being hedged, that ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P24_S0	There were no interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P25_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from direct to consumer product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is upon transfer of title to the product.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P25_S1	Recognition of revenue upon shipment meets the revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P25_S2	The Company also sells prepaid program cards to wholesalers and retailers.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P25_S3	Revenue from these cards is recognized after the card is redeemed online at the Company s website or via telephone by the customer and the product is shipped to the customer.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P25_S4	Revenue from the retail programs is recognized when the product is received at the seller s location.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P25_S5	Deferred revenue consists primarily of unredeemed prepaid gift cards and unshipped frozen foods.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P26_S0	When a customer orders the frozen program, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P26_S1	The first shipment contains Nutrisystem s standard shelf-stable food.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P26_S2	The second shipment contains the frozen foods and is generally delivered within a week of a customer s order.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P26_S3	Both shipments qualify as separate units of accounting and the fair value is based on estimated selling prices of both units.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P27_S0	Direct to consumer customers may return unopened shelf-stable products within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P29_S0	The Company outsources 100% of its fulfillment operations to a third-party provider and more than 94% of its orders are shipped by one third-party provider.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P30_S0	Vendor Rebates One of the Company s suppliers provides for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P30_S1	The Company accounts for this rebate on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percentage determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the vendor.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P30_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a receivable from the vendor with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory, and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P33_S0	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the direct mailing and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P33_S1	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P33_S2	Typically, this period falls within 40 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P33_S3	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P37_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P37_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P37_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P38_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P38_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P38_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P38_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P38_S4	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense, net.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P39_S0	The Company is managed and operated as one business.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P39_S1	The entire business is managed by a single management team that reports to the chief executive officer.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P39_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P40_S0	Earnings Per Share The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P41_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P41_S1	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P41_S2	Undistributed losses are not allocated to unvested restricted stock as the restricted stockholders are not obligated to share in the losses.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P42_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P43_S0	In 2012, diluted loss per common share is identical to basic loss per common share as the Company was in a net loss position and the impact of including common stock equivalents is anti-dilutive.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P43_S1	In 2014, 2013 and 2012, common stock equivalents representing 377, 786 and 1,637 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P44_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P45_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P45_S1	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P45_S2	The fair value of market-based restricted stock unit awards is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P45_S3	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (derived service period for market-based restricted stock unit awards), net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P45_S4	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P46_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options, granting of restricted stock or vesting of restricted stock units.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P46_S1	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $7,118, $2,842 and $1,250 in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P47_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1096376_15_ITEM15_P47_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P47_S2	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P47_S3	The new model will require an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P47_S4	It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P47_S5	This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P47_S6	The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P48_S0	In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Income Taxes, ( ASU 2013-11 ) which provides that an unrecognized tax benefit, or portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, would be presented in the financial statements as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward rather than a liability when the unrecognized tax benefit would reduce the net operating loss or other carryforward under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction and the Company intends to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P48_S1	If an applicable deferred tax asset is not available or the tax law does not require the company to use, and the company does not expect to use, the applicable deferred tax asset for such purpose, then the unrecognized tax benefit would be presented as a liability in the financial statements and would not be combined with an unrelated deferred tax asset.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P49_S0	ASU 2013-11 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P49_S1	ASU 2013-11 should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date; however, retrospective application is permitted.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P49_S2	Effective January 1, 2014, the Company adopted ASU 2013-11 and reduced its deferred tax asset for the unrecognized tax benefit.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P49_S3	The prior year consolidated balance sheet was reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P50_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P50_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P51_S0	CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS At December 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following:

1096376_15_ITEM15_P53_S0	FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established by the FASB to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P54_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P54_S1	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P54_S2	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P55_S0	The fair values of the Company s Level 1 instruments are based on quoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P55_S1	The Company had no Level 2 or 3 instruments at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S0	The Credit Facility provides for interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S1	The base rate will be the highest of (i) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (ii) 0.50% percent above the Federal Funds Rate and (iii) the LIBOR rate for deposits in dollars for a one-month interest period as determined three business days prior to such date, plus 1.50%.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S2	The LIBOR rate is equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the relevant term.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S3	The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the Company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and ranges from 0.25-1.25% per year for base rate loans and from 1.75-2.75% per year for LIBOR rate loans.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S4	The Company will also pay an unused line fee.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S5	The unused line fee is subject to adjustment based on the Company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and ranges from 0.25-0.375% per year.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S6	The Company incurred no interest expense during 2014 and 2013 and $764 during 2012.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S7	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company incurred $135, $140 and $159 in an unused line fee, respectively, under the Credit Facility and prior financing arrangements.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P58_S12	At December 31, 2014, the Company had $101 of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Credit Facility that are being amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P59_S0	The Company has used interest rate swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument, to manage interest costs and minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations on cash flows associated with its variable-rate debt.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company did not use interest rate derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P60_S0	While interest rate swaps are subject to fluctuations in value, these fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company minimized the risk of credit loss by entering into these agreements with financial institutions that have high credit ratings.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P62_S0	In January and June 2012, respectively, the Company entered into two separate $10,000 notional value forward-starting interest rate swaps.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P63_S0	The objective of the hedges was to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments for $20,000 of floating rate debt.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P63_S1	The swaps were terminated and expensed during 2012 upon the termination of a previous $100,000 credit facility and repayment of outstanding borrowings thereunder.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P63_S2	In addition, the Company had two separate $10,000 notional values floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements that matured on August 3, 2012 and September 28, 2012, respectively.

1096376_15_ITEM15_P69_S1	Unless otherwise required by law, the Board of Directors can, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock in the future with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the common stock.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P70_S0	The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, averting or preventing a change in control of the Company.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P71_S0	INCOME TAXES Income tax expense (benefit) consist of the following:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P72_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows: The change in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 was due to changes in executive compensation, decreased levels of food donations and the reduction in tax reserves during 2013 due to the lapse of the statute of limitations which offset a charge to record a valuation allowance in 2013 for charitable contributions carryforwards.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P72_S1	The change in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was due to the changes in executive compensation, decreased levels of food donations and the reduction in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations which offset a charge to record a valuation allowance for charitable contributions carryforwards that might not be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P72_S2	The significant items comprising the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows: At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $29,474 and $29,684, respectively, for state tax purposes.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P72_S3	For state tax purposes, there is a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in a given year to offset state taxable income.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P72_S4	Net operating losses will begin to expire in 2025.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P73_S0	In 2013, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $800 against its deferred tax asset generated for charitable contributions.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P74_S0	amount it expects is more likely than not to be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P74_S1	Based on the projected level of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the remaining net deferred tax assets.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P75_S0	An analysis of the activity of the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2014 is as follows:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $332, $311 and $1,474, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is approximately $216, $202 and $958 as of December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S2	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense, net.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S3	During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized interest income of $28, $71 and $13, respectively, from interest and penalties.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S4	The Company s federal income tax returns for 2011 through 2013 are open and are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S5	State tax jurisdictions that remain open to examination range from 2011 through 2013.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S6	The Company does not believe that that there will be any material changes to unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P76_S7	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the total unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S0	Equity Incentive Plans The Company has three equity incentive plans: the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the Equity Incentive Plans ).
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S1	The Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan is currently the only plan under which new awards may be granted.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S2	Under that plan, a variety of equity instruments can be granted to key employees and directors including incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units or shares of common stock.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S3	The 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorize up to 1,000, 5,600 and 5,400 shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S4	At December 31, 2014, the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan had 1,776 shares available for grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S5	Under each of the plans, the Board of Directors determines the term of each award, but no award can be exercisable more than 10 years from the date the award is granted.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S6	The stock options issued under the Equity Incentive Plans generally expire between seven and 10 years from the grant date.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S7	The Board also determines the vesting provisions of all awards and the exercise price per share of stock options issued under the plans, which is the fair market value at date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P77_S8	Awards issued to employees generally vest over terms ranging from two to four years.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P78_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity for 2012, 2013 and 2014:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P79_S0	In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recorded compensation expense of $426, $382 and $1,163, respectively, for stock option awards.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P79_S1	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $3.88, $1.61 and $1.96, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P79_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $219, $7 and $67, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P79_S3	The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions: In 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company authorized the issuance of 27, 50 and 43 fully vested shares of common stock, respectively, as compensation to the Board of Directors resulting in compensation expense of $455 in each year.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P79_S4	In addition, in 2014 and 2012, the Company issued a total of 2 and 22 shares of common stock, respectively, to non-employees for services.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P79_S5	No shares were issued to non-employees during 2013, although the shares issued in 2012 vested during 2013 resulting in expense upon vesting.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P79_S6	Costs recognized for shares issued to non-employees for services were $30, $195 and $573 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and approximated fair value.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P80_S0	The Company has issued restricted stock to employees generally with vesting terms ranging from two to four years.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P80_S1	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P81_S0	Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P81_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for 2012, 2013 and 2014: Additionally, the Company grants performance-based and market-based restricted stock units.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P81_S2	The performance-based units have performance conditions and service-based vesting conditions.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P81_S3	Each vesting tranche is treated as an individual award and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P81_S4	The requisite service period is a combination of the performance period and the subsequent vesting period based on continued service.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P81_S5	The level of achievement of such goals may cause the actual amount of units that ultimately vest to range from 0% to 150% of the original units granted.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P82_S0	The Company recognizes expense ratably over the vesting period for performance-based restricted stock units when it is probable that the performance criteria specified will be achieved.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P83_S0	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P84_S0	In 2012, grants of restricted stock units contained market-based conditions.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P84_S1	Market-based awards entitle employees to vest in a number of units determined by the Company s stock price return as compared to a set of comparator companies over a period, and will range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P84_S2	The fair value is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P84_S3	Compensation expense is recognized over the derived service periods using the straight-line method regardless of the outcome of the market conditions, so long as the award holder remains an employee through the requisite service period.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P85_S0	These awards contained different measurement periods.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P86_S0	The fair value of the market-based restricted stock units utilized the following inputs and assumptions:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P87_S0	The performance period starting price is measured as the average closing price over the last 20 trading days prior to the performance period start.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P87_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock unit activity:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company recorded compensation expense of $4,740, $4,800 and $7,721 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, in connection with the issuance of the restricted shares and restricted stock units.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P88_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the Company expects 403 shares of restricted stock and 355 restricted stock units to vest.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company recognized an increase in taxes payable of $68, $203 and $593 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, from the exercise of certain stock options and restricted stock and payment of certain dividends and recorded these amounts as decreases to additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P88_S3	As of December 31, 2014, there was $8,832 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements, including market-based units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P88_S4	The total unrecognized compensation expense will be fully expensed through the first quarter of 2018.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P89_S0	The Company maintains a qualified tax deferred defined contribution retirement plan (the Plan ).
1096376_15_ITEM15_P89_S1	Under the provisions of the Plan, substantially all employees meeting minimum age and service requirements are entitled to contribute on a before and after-tax basis a certain percentage of their compensation.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P89_S2	The Company matched 100% of employees first 3% contribution and 50% of the employees next 2% contribution.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P89_S3	Employees vest immediately in their contributions and the Company s contribution.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P89_S4	The Company s contributions in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $748, $633 and $614, respectively.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P90_S0	Following is an analysis for the returns reserve:
1096376_15_ITEM15_P91_S0	The sum of the quarterly basic and diluted per share amounts may not equal amounts reported for the year.
1096376_15_ITEM15_P91_S1	This is due to the effects of rounding and changes in weighted average shares outstanding for each period.

1096376_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	Overview Nutrisystem, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Nutrisystem, the Company, we, us, or our ) is a provider of weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs, multi-day kits available at select retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	Typically, our program customers purchase monthly food packages containing a four-week meal plan consisting of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks and flex meal plan recipes, which they supplement with fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	Most of our customers order on an auto-delivery basis ( Auto-Delivery ), which means we send a four-week meal plan on an ongoing basis until notified of a customer s cancellation.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P0_S3	Monthly notifications are also sent to remind customers to update order preferences.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P0_S4	We offer our pre-selected favorites food pack or personalized plans where customers can hand pick their entire menu or customize plans to their dietary preference.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P0_S5	Our meal plans feature more than 150 menu options at different price points including frozen and ready-to-go entrees, snacks and shakes.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P0_S6	Additionally , we offer comprehensive individualized counseling options from trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators and provide further support through our digital tools.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Our program is based on the following cornerstones that represent who we are to our customers:
1096376_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	The Nutrisystem program has helped millions of people lose weight successfully over our 40-plus year history.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	Our program is portioned for weight loss, nutritionally balanced and consistent with national guidelines for dietary intake meeting targets for total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, added sugar, cholesterol, carbohydrates, fiber and protein as well as national guidelines for physical activity.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P2_S2	We also offer transition and maintenance plans, which include personalized menu options (e.g., only dinner entrees) as well as continued counseling support and access to NuMi by Nutrisystem.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	NuMi is an easy-to-use, interactive and personalized solution to the nutritional and emotional components of a weight loss journey, giving users the help they need, when and where they need it most.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P3_S1	This digital product integrates with wearable fitness devices and health platforms and is available for free to Nutrisystem customers as well as the general population of do-it-yourself dieters.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P3_S2	These plans are designed to help our customers keep the weight off.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	The Nutrisystem program is based on more than 40 years of nutrition research and the science of the low Glycemic Index, and offers portion-controlled items that include relatively higher amounts of fiber and contain good carbohydrates and zero trans fats.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	The Glycemic Index is a measure of the quality of carbohydrates in foods.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Foods on the lower end of the Glycemic Index are generally considered good carbohydrates.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	In addition, in 2015, we continued to offer customers more meal choices, including more than 100 foods that contain no artificial preservatives, colors or flavors.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Nutrisystem sells its weight management program primarily through a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution approach using the Internet and telephone.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	Our customers can place orders 24 hours a day, seven days a week on our website, www.nutrisystem.com , and the food is shipped directly to our customers doors.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P6_S2	Our customers can either choose our pre-selected favorites food pack or personalize their monthly food orders for their specific tastes or dietary needs.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P6_S3	Our program does not require customers to visit centers, measure foods or count calories.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P6_S4	The entrees are individually packaged and food preparation time is minimal.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet and telephone provides the convenience and privacy that our customers value.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	In addition, we provide online and telephone counseling and support to our customers using trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians, certified diabetes educators and other nutrition and dietary staff, and as a result, our customers do not need to travel for face-to-face meetings.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	We believe we are very competitively priced within the weight management industry and provide a compelling value proposition to our customers, which includes a selection of more than 150 food items, expert guides, tools, including NuMi and access to trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians, certified diabetes educators and other nutrition and dietary staff.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	We do not charge membership fees.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	Various promotional offers and pricing are offered throughout the year.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe our program, kits and digital tools offer consumers a sensible approach to losing weight without the use of faddish, unhealthy or unrealistic weight loss methods by educating them about proper portion size, as well as the appropriate combinations of fiber, protein, good carbohydrates and fat.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths:
1096376_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using our program.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	Our customer research has found that customers lost an average of 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and tended to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	We have also sponsored clinical trials at leading academic centers in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	Statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control) were observed, in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe that our brand is well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Nutrisystem name has been in the weight management industry for more than 40 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we primarily generate revenue in our direct channel through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards).
1096376_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P14_S2	We also minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment: we outsource the production of our food products to a number of vendors and we outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations to a third-party provider.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	We also generate revenue through the sale of our products and kits at select retail locations.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	These products and kits represent a significant departure from our traditional four-week program and have expanded our products and consumer reach.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our program an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at an attractive price point.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight management program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our customers primarily place their orders through the Internet or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their homes.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P16_S2	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets, which rely on weight-loss centers, cannot ensure.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P16_S3	Additionally, we provide our customers with a package of food, including breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks, which removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P16_S4	We believe our weight management program offers our customers significant value and is priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P16_S5	In addition, unlike some of our competitors, we do not charge a membership fee.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S. population, as well as the global population.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	More than one-third (34.9% or 78.6 million) of U.S. adults are obese.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our clinical trial results suggest and analyses of real world customer results confirm that people who stay on the Nutrisystem program for at least three months have a high probability of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	In addition to the health risks, there are also cultural implications for those who are overweight or obese.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	U.S. consumers are inundated with imagery in media, fashion and entertainment that depicts the thin body as the ideal body type.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Studies suggest that there is rampant discrimination against people with obesity.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	Despite the high percentage of overweight and obese individuals in the U.S., the popularity of dieting appears to indicate consumers desire to be thin.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as well as medically supervised programs.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P21_S3	Our identified competitors include, but are not limited to, Weight Watchers International, Inc., Jenny Craig, Medifast, Inc., Atkins Nutritionals, Inc. and Slimfast.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We believe that the principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight loss industry.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	By providing a well-recognized food-based weight management program using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	Our Products and Services For more than 40 years, the Nutrisystem name has been recognized as a leader in the weight loss industry.

1096376_16_ITEM1_P26_S5	We constantly strive to meet or exceed nutritional guidelines as they are updated.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P26_S6	In December 2015, we announced the launch of our Turbo10 program, a clinically tested program that could deliver up to a 10-pound weight loss and a reduction of five inches overall in the first month of dieting.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P26_S7	Previously, we had offered the Fast 5+ kit, a one-week starter kit that could help customers lose five pounds plus one inch off their waist in their first week of dieting.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	A large and growing body of scientific evidence suggests a key predictor of long-term weight loss success is quick, early results, which these programs were designed to deliver.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Our program includes seven days of breakfasts, lunches, and dinners, plus shakes with formulations for men and women to meet their unique nutritional needs.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	As part of our program, customers are given a meal plan, access to trackers and tools via NuMi, educational digital content and exercise suggestions and are also encouraged to check in periodically with a Nutrisystem counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P28_S2	Our program delivers a combination of portion-controlled foods and an eating plan based on slow digesting carbohydrates like fiber, designed to help keep blood sugar levels stable throughout the day, minimizing hunger spikes and the feelings of deprivation that cause cravings.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P28_S3	Additionally, our multi-day kits are available at select retailers and represent a significant departure from our traditional four-week program.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P28_S4	We offer several varieties of our 5-day kit, a D kit targeted to individuals with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes, as well as SmartCarb and PowerFuel products including blueberry muffins, cinnamon buns, vanilla shakes, chocolate shakes and chocolate chip cookie packs, designed to complement our multi-day kits.

1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	Our computer-assisted picking system allows for virtually paperless order picking in all warehouse facilities.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	We utilize an integrated network of distribution facilities through an existing arrangement with our outside fulfillment provider.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	We work closely with our fulfillment provider to drive out waste and continuously improve processes.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S5	We currently utilize five outsourced distribution facilities.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S6	Three are located in Pennsylvania (Allentown, Bethlehem and Chambersburg) and two in Nevada (both in Sparks).
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S7	As of December 31, 2015, all fulfillment was being handled by one outsourced provider.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S8	In February 2016, we will have one additional outsourced distribution facility in Troy, Illinois with the same provider.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S9	We have a service agreement with our outside fulfillment provider which provides for storage, handling of frozen and ready-to-go foods and other services, including pricing and minimum space commitments.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S10	The current contract expires in 2020 but may be terminated sooner upon 180 days written notice.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S11	We believe that other outside fulfillment providers could be utilized if needed and we continually evaluate the need for secondary fulfillment services.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S12	We continue to partner with our fulfillment provider to reduce the warehouse order turn-around time for processing and shipping orders.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P43_S13	In 2015, approximately, 97% of all customer initial orders were shipped within 3 business days of the date the order was received.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	Direct customers are not charged for their orders until the ordered product is shipped.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	We do not charge customers for shipping and handling on any four-week meal plan.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	For customers who purchase an Auto-Delivery plan, we provide a discount off the full retail value of the four-week meal plan.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P44_S3	If an Auto-Delivery customer cancels before receipt of a second shipment and after the 14 day money back guarantee period, the customer will be charged a cancellation fee.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	All of our foods and supplements are currently outsourced from more than 35 manufacturers or vendors.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	We have entered into supply agreements with several of these food vendors, some of which may provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, exclusivity in the production of certain products, as well as certain rebates to us if certain volume thresholds are exceeded.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	These contracts have terms of five years or less and may be terminated by us upon written notice, generally between 30 and 180 days, or under certain circumstances only upon a default of the vendor.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	We anticipate meeting all annual purchase obligations.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P45_S4	In 2015, approximately 19% and 17% of inventory purchases were from two vendors.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P45_S5	We have a supply agreement with one of these vendors that requires us to make certain minimum purchases.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P45_S6	In 2014, these vendors supplied approximately 14% and 17% of inventory purchases and in 2013, approximately 12% and 14% of inventory purchases.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Our product development team uses a number of sources customer feedback, market trends, nutrition science, national dietary guidelines and breakthroughs in food technology to create new ideas for our program.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	of our cur rent offerings or to support the efforts of creating a new program.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	Typically, concepts are formulated in collaboration with our food manufacturers to meet our requirements for nutrition and stability.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P47_S2	We then contract with these food manufacturers to prod uce these products based on our specifications.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Alternatively, food manufacturers may suggest items.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste, and cost considera tions.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	We conduct a proactive public relations program that is designed to garner positive coverage of Nutrisystem and our weight management programs across all media platforms including television, magazine, print, online news, bloggers and social media, particularly around the key dieting seasons.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	In addition, the public relations team supports an executive communication program to broadly support the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our Customers We offer weight loss programs designed for women and men as well as people with Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	Based on our customer research, our typical customer is female, approximately 45-55 years of age.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	We believe that, on average, our customers want to lose more than 40 pounds over a period of time.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	Additionally, based on our customer research, we believe our typical customers tend to stay on our program for 11 to 12 weeks, lose an average of 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and have tried other popular diet programs.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	We believe that this research indicates our customers value the following Nutrisystem program attributes:
1096376_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	they feel satisfied while on the program.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our ecommerce and community websites and our tools and trackers, all of which are based primarily on third-party software customized to meet our business needs, are each hosted in top tier hosting facilities.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	These facilities provide redundant network connections, physical and fire security and diesel generated power back up for the equipment upon which our websites rely and are intended to provide an uninterruptible power supply.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Our servers and our network are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P53_S3	We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P53_S4	When our customers place an order or access their account information, we secure that transaction by using encryption technologies, including transport layer security, or TLS.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P53_S5	Our customer data is protected against unauthorized access by security measures and we engage a variety of industry leading technology providers including VeriSign, CyberSource and SecureWorks to further ensure the security of our credit card transactions and the safety of our customers personal information.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P53_S6	We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets are important to our success.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	Employees As of December 31, 2015, we had 451 employees and consider our relations with these employees to be good.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	Seasonality Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.
1096376_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	Available Information All periodic and current reports, registration statements, code of conduct and other material that we are required to file with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are available free of charge through our investor relations page at www.nutrisystem.com .

1096376_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our marketing expenditures were $124.2 million, $107.7 million and $95.8 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our program which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment and Internet and networking services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Food Manufacturers and Other Suppliers .
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We rely solely on third-party manufacturers to supply all of the food, other products we sell and packaging materials.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In 2015, approximately 19% and 17% of inventory purchases were from two vendors.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food, other products and packaging materials in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of the Nutrisystem brand.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In 2015, more than 96% of our orders were shipped by one third-party provider and 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by one third-party provider.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access and networking, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Further, if our website or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brand and loss of sales.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Therefore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) or United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We offer comprehensive individualized counseling options from registered dietitians, certified diabetes educators and weight loss counselors with varying levels of training.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our weight loss program does not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S8	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management program.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S9	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S12	If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S13	Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management program.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S6	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are dependent on certain third-party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third-party retailers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products and services are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales or transactions.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Additionally, some agreements contain exclusive rights in specified locations to promote our products during the contract term and for a specified period thereafter.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	In addition, our third-party retailers may decide to stop selling our products upon written notice, which may result in an increased level of reclamation claims as inventory held by the retailer is depleted.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the event any retailer terminates its relationship with us and the level of reclamation claims exceeds the estimated amount reserved on our balance sheet at the time of sale to the retailer, we will have to record an expense for the excess cl aims, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Additionally, in certain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in competitive advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our program.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our website.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additional states and governmental entities are considering such notice laws.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our website or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our website or purchasing our services or products.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We rely on third-party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment and result in chargebacks of the fraudulently charged amounts.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Furthermore, widespread credit card fraud may lessen our customers willingness to purchase our products on our website.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our business is seasonal, with revenue generally greatest in the first quarter and weaker in the fourth quarter.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P15_S12	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A cquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisitio n or new business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	A component of our growth strategy has been and may continue to be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and other complimentary products and services.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	On December 17, 2015, we acquired the South Beach Diet ( SBD ) brand for a cash payment of $15.0 million.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	These types of transactions will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If our brand suffers or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We use third-party marketing vendors to promote our products.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity or elect to not renew, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight management program.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Additionally, if a spokesperson elects not to renew their agreement with us, our revenue may suffer.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Third parties may infringe on our brand, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brand.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S8	If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S9	Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S11	In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P19_S12	We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Third parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Our credit agreement contains financial and other covenants.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Our credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, if there are outstanding borrowings, and limitations on, among other things, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement may result in an event of default under the agreement.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	We have not obtained life insurance on any key executive officers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P22_S9	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S5	Our program features frozen and ready-to-go food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our program versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S7	Changes in consumer tastes and preferences away from our frozen or ready-to-go food and support and counseling services, and any failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S8	Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S9	If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S10	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P23_S11	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	More recently, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their custome rs use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owne d weight loss centers.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity and restrictions of our business operations.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In October 2009, the FTC published its revised Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising which now requires us to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our program when using a customer s weight loss testimonial in advertising.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	For example, the labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and remain unsettled.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, including dietary supplements, as well as our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_16_ITEM1A_P33_S4	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenue and profits.
1096376_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	We currently lease one location in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
1096376_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	This location totals 119,767 square feet of office space and our lease expires in 2022.
1096376_16_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our fulfillment capacity is located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_16_ITEM2_P0_S3	In February 2016, we will have one additional outsourced distribution facility located in Troy, Illinois with the same provider.
1096376_16_ITEM2_P0_S4	We have no lease obligations to any of our outsourced fulfillment providers; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.
1096376_16_ITEM2_P0_S5	Management believes our outsourced fulfillment capacity is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1096376_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	Litigation The Company is involved in various claims and routine litigation matters.
1096376_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future years.
1096376_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Information The Company s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market, under the symbol NTRI.

1096376_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	Prior to 2008, we had not declared or paid any dividend since inception.

1096376_16_ITEM5_P2_S2	The declaration and payment of dividends in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.
1096376_16_ITEM5_P2_S3	See Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity, Capital Resources and Other Financial Data.
1096376_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans The information under the heading Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans will be filed in the Company s definitive proxy statement for the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference.
1096376_16_ITEM5_P4_S0	Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities There were no reportable purchases during the quarter ended December 31, 2015, provided however that 2,705 shares of common stock, at an average purchase price of $22.72, were surrendered by employees to the Company during such quarter for the payment of the minimum tax liability withholding obligations upon the vesting of shares of restricted stock.

1096376_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected consolidated financial data presented below has been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the periods indicated.
1096376_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	The data set forth below is qualified by reference to and should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our Consolidated Financial Statements included as Items 7 and 8, respectively, in this Annual Report.
1096376_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	In 2013, a charge of $5,000 was recorded to settle certain disputes that had arisen with a supplier over a legacy contract.
1096376_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	In 2013, we recorded $2,357 for severance, including $696 of non-cash expense related to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards.
1096376_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	During 2012, we recorded $5,724 of severance in general and administrative expense, including $3,293 of non-cash expense related to the acceleration of previously awarded equity-based awards, for our former President and Chief Executive Officer s cessation of employment.
1096376_16_ITEM6_P3_S1	Additionally, we recorded an impairment charge of $2,100 related to advances paid to a frozen food supplier as the supplier was in default with its bank lender and negotiating a work out plan and a charge of $1,980 to vacate a facility.
1096376_16_ITEM6_P3_S2	We also recorded a charge of $2,476 to restructure certain third party marketing vendor contracts and a charge of $1,079 to write off unamortized debt issuance costs.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Background We provide weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs, multi-day kits available at select retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	The weight loss programs are designed for women and men.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additionally, our Nutrisystem D program is designed specifically to help people with Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our programs are based on more than 40 years of nutrition research.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S4	Our food is created to be nutritious, delicious and portioned for weight loss and management.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S5	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network and select retailers.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S6	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P1_S7	For 2015, 2014 and 2013, the direct channel accounted for 90%, 91% and 92%, respectively, of revenue compared to 8%, 7% and 5%, respectively, for retail and 2%, 2% and 3%, respectively, for QVC.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brand as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	We market our weight management system through television, print, direct mail, Internet, public relations and social media.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, total revenue, marketing per new customer, operating margins and reactivation revenue.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our mix of revenue for the direct channel can be divided into three categories.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	First, new customer revenue is all revenue within a quarter from customers joining within that quarter.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	New customer revenue is the main driver of revenue growth.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	Second, on-program revenue is all revenue from customers who joined in previous quarters but who are still within their first nine months on the program.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	Third, reactivation revenue is all revenue generated from customers who are more than nine months from their initial purchase.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Our ecommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	We believe this flexibility is especially valuable as it allows us to react to changing market conditions relatively quickly.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additionally, we are continuously looking to make investments to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay and overall customer satisfaction.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S3	We are able to test new commercials, offers and website configurations to allow us to be more responsive to customer needs and attempt to drive conversion.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S4	We offer a customizable four-week program.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S5	In December 2015, we announced the launch of our Turbo10 program, a clinically tested program that could deliver up to a 10-pound weight loss and a reduction of five inches overall in the first month of dieting.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S6	Previously, we offered our Fast 5+ kit, a one-week starter kit that could help customers lose five pounds plus one inch off their waist in their first week of dieting.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S7	Customers are given a meal plan, access to trackers and tools via NuMi, educational digital content and exercise suggestions and are also encouraged to check in periodically with a Nutrisystem counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S8	Additionally, our multi-day weight loss kits are available at select retailers and represent a significant departure from our traditional four-week program.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S9	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our program an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at an attractive price point.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P4_S10	Also, we continue to offer our program at Costco through the use of the prepaid program cards and gift cards.

1096376_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	Management considers the following accounting estimates to be the most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P8_S5	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $13.2 million, $12.7 million and $10.8 million, respectively.

1096376_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $1.3 million and $460,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	The increase in the reserve was due to the change over to the 2016 product and packaging redesign and increased inventories.

1096376_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

1096376_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company s financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

1096376_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1096376_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1096376_16_ITEM15_P10_S0	The Company s pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid program cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network, and select retailers.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P10_S1	Approximately 99% of revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was generated in the United States.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P11_S0	Presentation of Financial Statements The Company s consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets and liabilities of Nutrisystem, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P12_S0	Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments Cash equivalents include only securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P12_S1	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, demand accounts and money market funds comprised all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P13_S0	Short term investments consist of investments in government and agency securities and corporate debt securities with original maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P13_S1	The Company classifies these investments as available-for-sale securities.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P13_S2	These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P14_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P14_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2015, 2014 or 2013.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P15_S0	Inventories Inventories consist principally of packaged food held in outside fulfillment locations.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P15_S1	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P15_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P15_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P15_S4	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $1,253 and $460 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P15_S5	Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P16_S0	Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally two to seven years.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P17_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P17_S1	Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P18_S0	Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development incurred during the application development stage.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P18_S1	Capitalized costs are amortiz ed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally two to five years.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P19_S0	Costs incurred related to planning or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are charged to expense as incurred.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P19_S1	The net book value of capitalized software was $ 15,022 and $13,162 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P20_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of a trade name from the acquisition of the South Beach Diet ( SBD ) brand in December 2015 and domain names (see Note 6).
1096376_16_ITEM15_P20_S1	The trade name is presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P20_S2	The domain names have indefinite lives and are not being amortized but are reviewed for impairment.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P21_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P21_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P21_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P21_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P22_S0	As of December 31, 2015, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P23_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from direct to consumer product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is upon transfer of title to the product.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P23_S1	Recognition of revenue upon shipment meets the revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P23_S2	The Company also sells prepaid program cards to wholesalers and retailers.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P23_S3	Revenue from these cards is recognized after the card is redeemed online at the Company s website or via telephone by the customer and the product is shipped to the customer.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P23_S4	Revenue from the retail programs is recognized when the product is received at the seller s location.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P23_S5	Deferred revenue consists primarily of unredeemed prepaid gift cards and unshipped food.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P24_S0	When a customer orders the frozen program, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P24_S1	One contains Nutrisystem s standard shelf-stable food and the second contains the frozen foods.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P24_S2	Both shipments qualify as separate units of accounting and the fair value is based on estimated selling prices of both units.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S0	Direct to consumer customers may return unopened shelf-stable products within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S1	Frozen products are non-returnable and they are non-refundable unless the order is canceled within 14 days of delivery.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S2	Estimated returns are accrued at the time the sale is recognized and actual returns are tracked monthly.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S3	The Company reviews its history of actual versus estimated returns to ensure reserves are appropriate.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S4	Revenue from product sales includes amounts billed for shipping and handling and is presented net of estimated returns and billed sales tax.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S5	Revenue from the retail programs is also net of any trade allowances, reclamation reserves or broker commissions.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S6	Revenue from shipping and handling charges was $2,561, $2,013 and $2,000 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P25_S7	Shipping-related costs are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P26_S0	Dependence on Suppliers In 2015, approximately 19% and 17% of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P26_S1	The Company has a supply arrangement with one of these suppliers that requires the Company to make minimum purchases.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P26_S2	In 2014, these suppliers provided approximately 14% and 17% of inventory purchases and in 2013, approximately 12% and 14% of inventory purchases (see Note 8).
1096376_16_ITEM15_P27_S0	In 2013, a charge of $5,000 was recorded to settle certain disputes that had arisen with a supplier over a legacy contract.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P27_S1	This charge is included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P28_S0	The Company outsources 100% of its fulfillment operations to a third-party provider and more than 96% of its orders are shipped by one third-party provider.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P29_S0	Supplier Rebates One of the Company s suppliers provides for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P29_S1	The Company accounts for this rebate on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percentage determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the supplier.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P29_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a receivable from the supplier with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P29_S3	The rebate period is June 1 through May 31 of each year.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P29_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company reduced cost of revenue by $698, $883 and $1,068 respectively, for these rebates.

1096376_16_ITEM15_P29_S6	Effective June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a new agreement with the supplier that includes lower initial pricing and higher levels of purchases required to earn rebates resulting in the Company projecting as of December 31, 2015 that no rebate will be earned.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P30_S0	Historically, the actual rebate received from the supplier has closely matched the estimated rebate recorded.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P30_S1	An adjustment is made to the estimate upon determination of the final rebate.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P31_S0	Marketing Expense Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P31_S1	Media expense was $104,621, $89,304 and $77,396 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P32_S0	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the direct mailing and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P32_S1	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P32_S2	Typically, this period falls within 40 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P32_S3	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P32_S4	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $3,311 and $1,958, respectively, of costs have been prepaid for future advertisements and promotions.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P33_S0	Lease Related Expenses Certain of the Company s lease contracts contain rent holidays, various escalation clauses, or landlord/tenant incentives.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P33_S1	The Company records rental costs, including costs related to fixed rent escalation clauses and rent holidays, on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P34_S0	Lease allowances utilized for space improvement are recorded as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P34_S1	Tenant lease incentive allowances received are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P34_S2	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is $2,266 of a tenant improvement allowance at December 31, 2015, of which $345 is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $1,921 in non-current liabilities.

1096376_16_ITEM15_P35_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P35_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P35_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P36_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P36_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P36_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P36_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P36_S4	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense, net.

1096376_16_ITEM15_P37_S1	The entire business is managed by a single management team that reports to the chief executive officer.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P37_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P38_S0	Earnings Per Share The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P39_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P39_S1	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P39_S2	Undistributed losses are not allocated to unvested restricted stock as the restricted stockholders are not obligated to share in the losses.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P40_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P41_S0	In 2015, 2014 and 2013, common stock equivalents representing 229, 377 and 786 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive or the minimum performance requirements have not yet been met.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P42_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P43_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P43_S1	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P43_S2	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P43_S3	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options, granting of restricted stock or vesting of restricted stock units.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P44_S1	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $13,508, $7,118 and $2,842 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

1096376_16_ITEM15_P45_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1096376_16_ITEM15_P45_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P45_S2	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P45_S3	The new model will require an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P45_S4	It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P45_S5	This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and should be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P46_S0	Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P47_S0	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, to provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P47_S1	If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P47_S2	If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P47_S3	The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P47_S4	The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P48_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P49_S0	An entity using an inventory method other than last-in, first out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P49_S1	The new guidance clarifies that net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P49_S2	This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P49_S3	The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P50_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P50_S1	Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a statement of financial position.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P50_S2	This standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P50_S3	The Company does not expect this new accounting standard to have a material impact of its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P51_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P51_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P52_S0	At December 31, 2015, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P53_S0	At December 31, 2014, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P54_S0	A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established by the FASB to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P55_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P55_S1	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P55_S2	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P56_S0	The fair values of the Company s Level 1 instruments are based on quoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P56_S1	The Company had no Level 2 or 3 instruments at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P56_S2	The following table summarizes the Company s financial assets measured at fair value at December 31, 2015:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P57_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s financial assets measured at fair value at December 31, 2014:

1096376_16_ITEM15_P61_S0	The Company will begin developing South Beach Diet meal programs, products, and services as a distinct brand with the intent to launch in both the direct-to-consumer and reta il channels in 2017.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P61_S1	The acquisition will provide consumers with additional quality choices and enable the Company to capture an even more significant share of the commercial weight loss market as it further leverages its expertise in product development, marketing, ec ommerce, supply chain logistics and retail.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P62_S0	The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is to the SBD trade name and is expected to be amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P62_S1	The approximate fair value of the trade name is based on preliminary estimates and assumptions.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P63_S0	The fair value measurement method used to measure the assets acquired utilizes a number of significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 assumptions.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P63_S1	These assumptions include, among others, projections of the acquired businesses future operating results, the implied fair value of assets using an income approach by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis and other subjective assumptions.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P63_S2	These preliminary estimates and assumptions could change during the purchase price measurement period as the Company finalizes the valuation of the asset acquired.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P64_S0	No amortization expense was recorded for 2015.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P64_S1	Estimated amortization expense for identifiable intangible assets for the next five years is expected to be as follows:

1096376_16_ITEM15_P68_S0	The Credit Facility provides for interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P68_S1	The base rate will be the highest of (i) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (ii) 0.50% above the Federal Funds Rate and (iii) the LIBOR rate for deposits in dollars for a one-month interest period as determined three business days prior to such date, plus 1.50%.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P68_S2	The LIBOR rate is equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the relevant term.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P68_S3	The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the Company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and ranges from 0.00-0.50% per year for base rate loans and from 1.25-1.75% per year for LIBOR rate loans.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P68_S4	The Company will also pay an unused line fee.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P68_S5	The unused line fee is 0.25% of the total available credit.

1096376_16_ITEM15_P78_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P79_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P80_S0	The change in the effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 was due to the write-off of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities offset by increased levels of food donations.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P80_S1	The change in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 was due to the changes in executive compensation, decreased levels of food donations and the reduction in tax reserves due to the lapse of the statute of limitations which offset a charge to record a valuation allowance for charitable contributions carryforwards that might not be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P81_S0	The significant items comprising the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P82_S0	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $28,696 and $29,474 , respectively, for state tax purposes.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P82_S1	For state tax purposes, there is a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in a given year to offset state taxable income.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P82_S2	Net operating losses will begin to expire in 2025.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P83_S0	In 2013, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $800 against its deferred tax asset generated for charitable contributions.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Company recorded the valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount it expects is more likely than not to be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P83_S2	In 2015, the Company wrote off the valuation allowance as certain charitable contribution carryovers expired.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P84_S0	Based on the projected level of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the remaining net deferred tax assets.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P85_S0	An analysis of the activity of the valuation allowance is as follows:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P86_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $272, $332 and $311, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P86_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is approximately $177, $216 and $202 as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P87_S0	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense, net.

1096376_16_ITEM15_P88_S0	The Company s federal income tax returns for 2012 through 2014 are open and are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P88_S1	State tax jurisdictions that remain open to examination range from 2012 through 2014.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P88_S2	The Company does not believe that that there will be any material changes to unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P88_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the total unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S0	Equity Incentive Plans The Company has three equity incentive plans: the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the Equity Incentive Plans ).
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan is currently the only plan under which new awards may be granted.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S2	Under that plan, a variety of equity instruments can be granted to key employees and directors including incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units or shares of common stock.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S3	The 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorize up to 1,000, 5,600 and 5,400 shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S4	At December 31, 2015, the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan had 1,476 shares available for grant.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S5	Under each of the plans, the Board of Directors determines the term of each award, but no award can be exercisable more than 10 years from the date the award is granted.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S6	The stock options issued under the Equity Incentive Plans generally expire between seven and 10 years from the grant date.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S7	The Board also determines the vesting provisions of all awards and the exercise price per share of stock options issued under the plans, which is the fair market value at date of grant.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P89_S8	Awards issued to employees generally vest over terms ranging from two to four years.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P90_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity for 2013, 2014 and 2015:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P91_S0	In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded compensation expense of $647, $426 and $382, respectively, for stock option awards.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P91_S1	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $5.18, $3.88 and $1.61, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P91_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $5,520, $219 and $7, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P92_S0	The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P93_S0	In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company authorized the issuance of 22, 27 and 50 fully vested shares of common stock, respectively, as compensation to the Board of Directors resulting in compensation expense of $509, $455 and $455, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P93_S1	In addition, in 2014, the Company issued 2 shares of common stock to consultants for services.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P93_S2	No shares were issued to consultants during 2015 or 2013, although certain shares issued in 2012 vested during 2013 resulting in expense upon vesting.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P93_S3	Costs recognized for shares issued to non-employees for services were $30 and $195 in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P93_S4	No expense was recognized in 2015.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P94_S0	The Company has issued restricted stock to employees generally with vesting terms ranging from two to four years.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P94_S1	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P95_S0	Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P95_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for 2013, 2014 and 2015:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P96_S0	Additionally, the Company grants performance-based stock units.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P96_S1	The performance-based units have performance conditions and service-based vesting conditions.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P96_S2	Each vesting tranche is treated as an individual award and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P96_S3	The requisite service period is a combination of the performance period and the subsequent vesting period based on continued service.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P96_S4	The level of achievement of such goals may cause the actual amount of units that ultimately vest to range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company recognizes expense ratably over the vesting period for performance-based restricted stock units when it is probable that the performance criteria specified will be achieved.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P98_S0	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P98_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock unit activity:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P99_S0	The Company recorded compensation expense of $4,312, $4,740 and $4,800 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, in connection with the restricted stock and restricted stock units.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P99_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the Company expects 264 shares of restricted stock and 308 restricted stock units to vest.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P100_S0	$(203) i n 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, from the exercise of certain stock options and restricted stock and payment of certain dividends and recorded these amounts as decreases and increases to additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated state ments of stockholders equity.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P101_S0	As of December 31, 2015, there was $5,714 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P101_S1	The total unrecognized compensation expense will be fully charged to expense through the fourth quarter of 2018.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P102_S0	The Company maintains a qualified tax deferred defined contribution retirement plan (the Plan ).
1096376_16_ITEM15_P102_S1	Under the provisions of the Plan, substantially all employees meeting minimum age and service requirements are entitled to contribute on a before and after-tax basis a certain percentage of their compensation.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P102_S2	The Company matched 100% of employees first 3% contribution and 50% of the employees next 2% contribution.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P102_S3	Employees vest immediately in their contributions and the Company s contribution.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P102_S4	The Company s contributions in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $794, $748 and $633, respectively.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P103_S0	Following is an analysis for the returns reserve:
1096376_16_ITEM15_P104_S0	The sum of the quarterly basic and diluted per share amounts may not equal amounts reported for the year.
1096376_16_ITEM15_P104_S1	This is due to the effects of rounding and changes in weighted average shares outstanding for each period.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P8_S4	The entrees are individually packaged and food preparation time is minimal.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	The direct-to-consumer approach using the Internet and telephone provides the convenience and privacy that our customers value.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	In addition, we provide online and telephone support to our customers using trained weight loss counselors, registered dietitians, certified diabetes educators and other nutrition and dietary staff, and as a result, our customers do not need to travel for face-to-face meetings.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	We believe we are very competitively priced within the weight management industry and provide a compelling value proposition to our customers, which includes a selection of more than 150 menu items, expert guides, tools, including NuMi, and access to nutrition and dietary staff.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	Various promotional offers and pricing are offered throughout the year.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Competitive Strengths We believe our programs, kits and digital tools offer consumers a sensible approach to losing weight without the use of faddish, unhealthy or unrealistic weight loss methods by educating them about proper portion size, as well as the appropriate combinations of fiber, protein, good carbohydrates and fat.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths:
1096376_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using our program.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P12_S1	Our customer research has found that Nutrisystem customers lost an average of 1.0 to 2.0 pounds per week and tended to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	academic centers , including in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	Studies on our Nu trisystem D Program showed s tatistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose con trol) were observed, in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	We believe that our brands are well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Nutrisystem name has been in the weight management industry for more than 40 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we primarily generate revenue in our direct channel online and through the telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards).
1096376_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	We also minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment: we outsource the production of our food products to a number of vendors and we outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations to a third-party provider.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight loss program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our customers primarily place their orders online or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their homes.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets, which rely on weight-loss centers, cannot ensure.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	Additionally, we provide our customers with monthly food packages containing a four-week meal plan consisting of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and flex meal plan recipes, which they supplement with fresh fruits, vegetables, lean protein and low-fat dairy.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	This removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We believe our weight loss programs offer our customers significant value and are priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	In addition, unlike some of our competitors, we do not charge a membership fee.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	We also generate revenue through the sale of our multi-day kits and single items at select retail locations.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	These multi-day kits and single items have expanded our products and consumer reach.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at a more attractive price point.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S. population, as well as the global population.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	It is estimated that more than one-third (34.9% or 78.6 million) of U.S. adults are obese.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	Our clinical trial results suggest and analyses of real world customer results confirm that people who stay on the Nutrisystem program for at least three months have a high probability of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	In addition to the health risks, there are also cultural implications for those who are overweight or obese.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	U.S. consumers are inundated with imagery in media, fashion and entertainment that depicts the thin body as the ideal body type.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	Despite the high percentage of overweight and obese individuals in the U.S., the popularity of dieting appears to indicate consumers desire to lose weight.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, meal replacement products, as well as medically supervised programs.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P23_S4	Our identified competitors include, but are not limited to, Weight Watchers International, Inc., Jenny Craig and Medifast, Inc.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P23_S5	We believe that our principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight loss industry.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P25_S2	By providing a well-recognized food-based weight management program using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	We have also worked to reduce the sodium content of our Nutrisystem programs.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	Including grocery additions to supplement our meals, all plans contain less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, consistent with national guidelines, and tailored versions of the plans are available that deliver as low as 1,500 mg/day.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P28_S3	In contrast, the average American consumes 2,500-4,600 milligrams of sodium per day.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	We constantly strive to meet or exceed nutritional guidelines as they are updated.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	In 2016, we offered the Turbo10 program, a clinically tested program that could deliver up to a 10-pound weight loss and a reduction of five inches overall in the first month of dieting.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	A large and growing body of scientific evidence suggests a key predictor of long-term weight loss success is quick, early results, which our programs are designed to deliver.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	Customers are given a meal plan, access to trackers and tools via NuMi, educational digital content and exercise suggestions.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Customers are also encouraged to check in periodically with a counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Nutrisystem programs deliver a combination of portion-controlled foods and an eating plan based on slow-digesting carbohydrates like fiber, designed to help keep blood sugar levels stable throughout the day, minimizing hunger spikes and the feelings of deprivation that cause cravings.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	In December 2016, we announced our multi-brand approach with two new distinct programs, Nutrisystem Lean13 and the all new South Beach Diet .
1096376_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Lean13 is designed to deliver weight loss of up to 13 pounds and seven inches in the first month.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	South Beach Diet launched in January 2017 as a structured meal delivery weight-loss program.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The plan features fully prepared, globally inspired meals that are flash-frozen to maintain the quality of taste and nutrition, and delivered right to the customer s doorstep.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	The South Beach Diet was created by Dr. Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist from southern Florida.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	In 2003, he published The South Beach Diet, which became a bestseller with more than 23 million copies in print and multiple titles appearing on the New York Times bestseller list.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S2	Additionally, our multi-day kits are available at select retailers.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S3	We offer several varieties of our Nutrisystem 5-day kit, a D kit targeted to individuals with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes, as well as SmartCarb and PowerFuel products including blueberry muffins, cinnamon buns, vanilla shakes, chocolate shakes and chocolate chip cookie packs, designed to complement our multi-day kits.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S4	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at a more attractive price point.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S5	We are seeing repeat business as well as multiple kit purchases, indicating that customers are seeing results or enlisting other family members to diet with them.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S6	Also, we continue to offer our Nutrisystem programs at Costco through the use of prepaid gift cards.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P35_S7	We are actively developing our retail product pipeline and have multiple kits and single items available for purchase.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	It provides nutrition consistent with the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	Two randomized controlled trials pu blished in peer-reviewed medical journals found the Nu trisystem D Program , in combination with counseling sessions, produced statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in weight, HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control), and several other risk factors.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	Notably, improvements in diabetes control were observed along with a reduction in diabetes medications among participants who received the Nutrisystem D intervention.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	A third study, utilizing continuous glucose monitoring technology, found i mprovements in blood glucose control when subjects used the Nu trisystem D Program , even before the achievement of significant weight loss.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	By offering a variety of frozen and ready-to-go foods, we help our customers sustain their weight loss efforts.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	On our websites, customers can order food 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	The transition and maintenance plans allow customers the means to gradually increase their responsibility for grocery shopping and food preparation while adhering to the principles of the approach of our weight loss programs.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	These lower cost programs help extend the supportive relationship and allow time to reinforce the dietary changes that produced the initial weight loss.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S4	These plans include recipes and portion-control tools in addition to a reduced number of entrees delivered each month.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S5	Our weight loss programs features are counter to traditional weight loss programs limitations, such as, high initiation and recurring membership fees, the inconvenience of traveling to weight loss centers for scheduled appointments and lack of privacy.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S6	In addition, our prepared meals provide our customers with a structured program with limited weighing and measuring of foods and no need to count calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S7	Customers are provided breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and flex meal plan recipes, which they supplement with fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and low-fat dairy.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P38_S8	We believe that the convenience of home delivery, reduced grocery shopping time, the portability of the food, and rapid food preparation also aid customer compliance with our weight loss program.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through development, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste and cost considerations.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	We conduct a proactive public relations program that is designed to garner positive coverage of the Company and our weight loss programs across all media platforms including television, magazine, print, online news, bloggers and social media, particularly around the key dieting seasons.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	We believe that, on average, Nutrisystem customers want to lose more than 40 pounds over a period of time.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P59_S3	We use a variety of security techniques to protect our confidential customer data.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P59_S4	When our customers place an order or access their account information, we secure that transaction by using encryption technologies, including transport layer security, or TLS.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, and trade secrets is important to our success.

1096376_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	Employees As of December 31, 2016, we had 487 employees and consider our relations with these employees to be good.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Typically in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

1096376_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	You should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our marketing expenditures were $152.4 million, $124.2 million and $107.7 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our program which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment and Internet and networking services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Food Manufacturers and Other Suppliers .
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We rely solely on third-party manufacturers to supply all of the food, other products we sell and packaging materials.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In 2016, two vendors each supplied approximately 11% of inventory purchases.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food, other products and packaging materials in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of our brands.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In 2016, 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by one third-party provider.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Also, more than 98% of our direct to consumer orders were shipped by one third-party provider and more than 98% of our orders for retail programs were shipped by another third-party provider.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access and networking, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Further, if our websites or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brand and loss of sales.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Therefore, w e are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or USDA or United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We offer counseling options from weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators with varying levels of training.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our weight loss programs do not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S8	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management programs or by consuming one or more of our individual products.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S9	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S12	If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S13	Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management programs.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S6	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are dependent on certain third-party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third-party retailers.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If any third party elects not to renew their agreement with us or reduces the promotion of our products, our revenue will suffer.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	to stop selling our products upon written notice, which may result in an increased level of reclamation claims.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the event any retailer terminates its relationship with us and the level of reclamation cla ims exceeds the estimated amount reserved on our balance sheet at the time of sale to the retailer, we will have to record an expense for the excess claims, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Additionally, in ce rtain instances, we could be prohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in comparative advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our program.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our websites.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P13_S3	These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additional states and governmental entities are considering such notice laws.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our websites or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our websites or purchasing our services or products.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We rely on third-party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment and result in chargebacks of the fraudulently charged amounts.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Furthermore, widespread credit card fraud may lessen our customers willingness to purchase our products on our websites.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our business is seasonal, with revenue generally greatest in the first quarter and weakest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P15_S12	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	A cquisiti ons and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	A component of our growth strategy has been and may continue to be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and other complimentary products and services.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These types of transactions will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have and expect to continue to launch new weight loss programs and brands which may not be successful due to the failure of such programs or brands to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There are a number of risks inherent in any new program or brand introduction, which could prevent us from achieving revenue growth and increasing our overall market share in the commercial weight loss market.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any new program or brand may fail to achieve the anticipated level of market acceptance or appeal to consumer tastes and preferences.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, introduction costs, including product testing and marketing, may be greater than anticipated.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If the new program or brand is not successful or falls short of anticipated market acceptance, we may be adversely affected by continued expenses and the diversion of management time to this initiative.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any or all of such events could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S6	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If our brands suffer or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We use third-party marketing vendors to promote our products.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity or elect to not renew, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight loss programs.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Additionally, if a spokesperson elects not to renew their agreement with us, our revenue may suffer.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Third parties may infringe on our brand s , trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brands.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brands and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Third parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S10	In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S11	If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our credit agreement contains financial and other covenants.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (applicable if there are outstanding borrowings), and limitations on, among other things, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2016.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement may result in an event of default under the agreement.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P24_S8	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our programs feature frozen and ready-to-go food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our programs versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	fail ure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financia l condition, operating results and cash flows.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In the early 1990s, our predecessor businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S7	In addition, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S8	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S11	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P26_S12	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity and restrictions of our business operations.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry, in particular, have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies and many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, the FTC s Guides concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising require us and other weight loss companies to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our programs when using a customer s weight loss testimonial in advertising.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P30_S2	For example, the manufacturing, labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are more prevalent and remain unsettled.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, including dietary supplements, as well as our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenue and profits.
1096376_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	We currently lease one location in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
1096376_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	This location totals 119,767 square feet of office space and our lease expires in 2022.
1096376_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our fulfillment capacity is located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, Allentown, Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Troy, Illinois and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	In April 2017, we expect to have one additional outsourced distribution facility located in Lithonia, Georgia with the same provider.
1096376_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	We have no lease obligations to any of our outsourced fulfillment providers; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.
1096376_17_ITEM2_P0_S5	Management believes our outsourced fulfillment capacity is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1096376_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in various claims and routine litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1096376_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future years and management believes the range of reasonably possible losses from current matters is immaterial.

1096376_17_ITEM5_P5_S1	The timing, number and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by us at our discretion and will be based on a number of factors including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions, the trading price of the common stock, regulatory requirements and compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.

1096376_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	Background We provide weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs sold primarily online and over the telephone, multi-day kits and single items available at select retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss .
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	The weight loss programs are designed for women and men.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additionally, our Nutrisystem D program is designed specifically to help people with Type 2 diabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes, who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our programs are based on over 40 years of nutrition research.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	Our food is created to be nutritious, delicious and portioned for weight loss and management.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S5	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network, and select retailers.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S6	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P1_S7	For 2016, 2015 and 2014, the direct channel accounted for 91%, 90% and 91%, respectively, of revenue compared to 6%, 8% and 7%, respectively, for retail and 3%, 2% and 2%, respectively, for QVC.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	We market our weight loss systems through television, print, direct mail, Internet, public relations and social media.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, reactivation revenue, total revenue, marketing per new customer and operating margins.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our ecommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S5	We believe this flexibility is especially valuable as it allows us to react to changing market conditions relatively quickly.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S6	Additionally, we are continually looking to make investments to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay and overall customer satisfaction.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S7	We are able to test new commercials, offers and website configurations to allow us to be more responsive to customer needs and attempt to drive conversion.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S8	We offer a customizable four-week program.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P2_S9	In 2016, we offered the Turbo10 program, a clinically tested program that could deliver up to a 10-pound weight loss and a reduction of five inches overall in the first month of dieting.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Customers are given a meal plan, access to trackers and tools via NuMi, educational digital content and exercise suggestions.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	Customers are also encouraged to check in periodically with a counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	In December 2016, we announced our multi-brand approach with two new distinct programs, Nutrisystem Lean13 and the all new South Beach Diet .
1096376_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Lean13 is designed to deliver weight loss of up to 13 pounds and seven inches in the first month.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	South Beach Diet launched in January 2017 as a structured meal delivery weight-loss program.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	The plan features fully prepared, globally inspired meals that are flash-frozen to maintain the quality of taste and nutrition, and delivered right to the customer s doorstep.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The South Beach Diet was created by Dr. Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist from southern Florida.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	In 2003, he published The South Beach Diet, which became a bestseller with more than 23 million copies in print and multiple titles appearing on the New York Times bestseller list.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	Additionally, our multi-day weight loss kits are available at select retailers.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at a more attractive price point.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	Also, we continue to offer our Nutrisystem programs at Costco through the use of prepaid gift cards.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S5	We are actively developing our retail product pipeline and have multiple kits and single items available for purchase.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S6	We believe these new product and program innovations are resonating well with our customers.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S7	We provide an increasingly diverse array of weight loss solutions for our customers through an expanding portfolio of products.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S8	Our customers now have greater flexibility in choosing between ready-to-go and frozen options, with no restrictions.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S9	We believe this translates into higher customer satisfaction and more profit.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S10	We had an effective acquisition marketing campaign with increased pricing that drove increases in customer activations and average selling price in 2016 as compared to 2015.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S11	We also introduced several add-on products, including shakes and additional flexible options which helped increase demand.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S12	Revenue for 2016 increased 18% from 2015 to $545.5 million.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S13	Our revenue growth was attributable primarily to the direct channel due to revenue from new customers in their initial diet cycle, the reactivation of former customers and increased sales of our premium products.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S14	Reactivation revenue increased due to higher volumes building off of recent increases in new customer counts and a higher reactivation rate.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P6_S15	QVC revenue also increased in 2016 compared to 2015 which offset a decline in retail revenue.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	The accounting estimates we consider critical include reserves for returns, excess and obsolete inventory and income taxes.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S7	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S8	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S9	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P7_S10	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $14.9 million, $13.2 million and $12.7 million, respectively.

1096376_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	We continually assess the quantities of inventory on hand to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	We estimate the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecasted demand and/or our ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in our customers behavior.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $1.3 million at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P9_S1	Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P9_S2	We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings and expectations of future taxable income and other relevant factors.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P9_S3	At December 31, 2014, we had a valuation allowance of $800,000 recorded against our deferred tax asset generated for charitable contributions.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P9_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we reduced the valuation allowance to zero due to the expiration of certain charitable contribution carryovers.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P9_S5	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was no valuation allowance.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	We estimate the annual effective income tax rate at the beginning of each year and revise the estimate at each reporting period based on a number of factors including operating results, level of tax exempt interest income, charitable contributions and sales by state, among other items.

1096376_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	The timing, number and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by us at our discretion and will be based on a number of factors including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions, the trading price of the common stock, regulatory requirements and compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P24_S3	The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P24_S4	No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2016.
1096376_17_ITEM7_P24_S5	Our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.175 per share, which were paid on March 17, 2016, May 23, 2016, August 18, 2016 and November 17, 2016.

1096376_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.
1096376_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk instruments.

1096376_17_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P3_S1	Based upon that evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Their report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting appears on page 29.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Nutrisystem, Inc.: We have audited Nutrisystem, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S1	Nutrisystem, Inc.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P4_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P5_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P5_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1096376_17_ITEM9A_P5_S4	In our opinion, Nutrisystem, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1096376_17_ITEM15_P8_S0	Nature of the Business Nutrisystem, Inc. (the Company or Nutrisystem ) is a provider of weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs sold primarily online and over the telephone, multi-day kits and single items available at select retail locations and digital tools to support weight loss.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P8_S1	The weight loss programs are designed for women and men.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P8_S2	Additionally, the Nutrisystem D program is designed specifically to help people with Type 2 diabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Nutrisystem programs are based on over 40 years of nutrition research.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P10_S0	The Company s pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network, and select retailers.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P10_S1	Approximately 99% of revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was generated in the United States.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P11_S0	Presentation of Financial Statements The Company s consolidated financial statements include 100% of the assets and liabilities of Nutrisystem, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P11_S1	All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P12_S0	Cash Equivalents and Short Term Investments Cash equivalents include only securities having a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P12_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, demand accounts and money market funds comprised all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P13_S0	Short term investments consist of investments in government and agency securities and corporate debt securities with maturities between three months and three years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P13_S1	The Company classifies these investments as available-for-sale securities.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P13_S2	These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P14_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P14_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2016, 2015 or 2014.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P15_S0	Inventories Inventories consist principally of packaged food held in outside fulfillment locations.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P15_S1	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P15_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P15_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P15_S4	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $1,260 and $1,253 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P15_S5	Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P16_S0	Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally two to seven years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P17_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P17_S1	Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P18_S0	Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development incurred during the application development stage.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P18_S1	Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the a sset, which is generally two to five years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P18_S2	Costs incurred related to planning or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are charged to expense as incurred.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P18_S3	The net book value of capitalized software was $17,868 and $15,022 at Decembe r 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P18_S4	During 2016, the Company determined certain software licenses were no longer expected to be used as more enhanced software options have become available to handle its evolving business needs and a charge of $1,297 was recorded to write-down these assets.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P18_S5	The charge was recorded as depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P19_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of a trade name from the acquisition of the South Beach Diet ( SBD ) brand in December 2015 and domain names (see Note 6).
1096376_17_ITEM15_P19_S1	The trade name is presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P19_S2	The domain names have indefinite lives and are not being amortized but are reviewed for impairment.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P20_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P20_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P20_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P20_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2016, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P22_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from direct to consumer product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is upon transfer of title to the product.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P22_S1	Recognition of revenue upon shipment meets the revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P22_S2	The Company also sells prepaid gift cards to wholesalers and retailers.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P22_S3	Revenue from these cards is recognized after the card is redeemed online at the Company s website or via telephone by the customer and the product is shipped to the customer.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P22_S4	Revenue from the retail programs is recognized when the product is received at the seller s location.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P22_S5	Deferred revenue consists primarily of unredeemed prepaid gift cards and unshipped foods.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P23_S0	When a customer orders the frozen program, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P23_S1	One contains Nutrisystem s ready-to-go food and the other contains the frozen food.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P23_S2	Both shipments qualify as separate units of accounting and the fair value is based on estimated selling prices of both units.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S0	Direct to consumer customers may return unopened ready-to-go products within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S1	Frozen products are non-returnable and non-refundable unless the order is canceled within 14 days of delivery.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S2	Estimated returns are accrued at the time the sale is recognized and actual returns are tracked monthly.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S3	The Company reviews its history of actual versus estimated returns to ensure reserves are appropriate.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S4	Revenue from product sales includes amounts billed for shipping and handling and is presented net of estimated returns and billed sales tax.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S5	Revenue from the retail programs is also net of any trade allowances, reclamation reserves or broker commissions.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S6	Revenue from shipping and handling charges was $2,869, $2,561 and $2,013 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P24_S7	Shipping-related costs are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P25_S0	Dependence on Suppliers In 2016, approximately 11% and 11% of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P25_S1	The Company has a supply arrangement with one of these suppliers that requires the Company to make minimum purchases.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P25_S2	In 2015, these suppliers provided approximately 19% and 17% of inventory purchases and in 2014, approximately 14% and 17% of inventory purchases (see Note 8).
1096376_17_ITEM15_P26_S0	The Company outsources 100% of its fulfillment operations to a third-party provider.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P26_S1	Additionally, more than 98% of its direct to consumer orders are shipped by one third-party provider and more than 98% of its orders for the retail programs are shipped by another third party provider.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P27_S0	Supplier Rebates Two of the Company s suppliers provide for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company accounts for these rebates on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percentage determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the supplier.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P27_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a receivable from the supplier with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P27_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company reduced cost of revenue for these rebates by $75, $698 and $883, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P27_S4	No receivable was recorded at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P27_S5	Effective June 1, 2015, the Company entered into a new agreement with one of these suppliers that includes lower initial pricing and higher levels of purchases required to earn rebates resulting in the lower reductions of cost of revenue in 2016.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P28_S0	Marketing Expense Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P28_S1	Media expense was $130,451, $104,621 and $89,304 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P29_S0	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P29_S1	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertisements and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P29_S2	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P29_S3	Typically, this period falls within 50 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P29_S4	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P29_S5	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, $2,155 and $3,311, respectively, of costs have been prepaid for future advertisements and promotions.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P30_S0	Lease Related Expenses Certain of the Company s lease contracts contain rent holidays, various escalation clauses, or landlord/tenant incentives.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P30_S1	The Company records rental costs, including costs related to fixed rent escalation clauses and rent holidays, on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P31_S0	Lease allowances utilized for space improvement are recorded as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P31_S1	Tenant lease incentive allowances received are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P31_S2	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is $1,921 of a tenant improvement allowance at December 31, 2016, of which $345 is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $1,576 in non-current liabilities.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P31_S3	At December 31, 2015, the tenant improvement allowance was $2,266, of which $345 was included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $1,921 in non-current liabilities.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P32_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P32_S1	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P32_S2	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P33_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P33_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P33_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P33_S3	The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified as noncurrent unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within 12 months of the reporting date.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P33_S4	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest expense, net.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P34_S0	The Company is managed and operated as one business.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P34_S1	The entire business is managed by a single management team that reports to the chief executive officer.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P34_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P35_S0	Earnings Per Share The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P36_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P36_S1	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P36_S2	Undistributed losses are not allocated to unvested restricted stock as the restricted stockholders are not obligated to share in the losses.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P37_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:
1096376_17_ITEM15_P38_S0	In 2016, 2015 and 2014, common stock equivalents representing 335, 229 and 377 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive or the minimum performance requirements for such common stock equivalents have not yet been met.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P39_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P40_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P40_S1	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P40_S2	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P40_S3	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant except for performance-based units which are recognized on a straight-line basis based on the probable expected performance to be achieved and adjusted accordingly if performance varies.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P41_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options, granting of restricted stock or vesting of restricted stock units.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P41_S1	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $14,175, $13,508 and $7,118 in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

1096376_17_ITEM15_P42_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P42_S2	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P42_S3	The new model will require an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P42_S4	It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P43_S0	presented or retrospe ctively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P43_S1	The Company is currently anticipating adopting this standard using the modified retrospective method.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P43_S2	Based on its ongoing evaluation of ASU 201 4-09, the Company currently does not expect it to have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognition for transactions with customers in the direct or retail channels.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P43_S3	The Company is still evaluating the impact of gift cards and there cou ld be an impact to the pattern with which revenue is recognized.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P43_S4	The Company is continuing to evaluate the effect that the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P44_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P45_S0	An entity using an inventory method other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P45_S1	The new guidance clarifies that net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P45_S2	This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P45_S3	The adoption of this new accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P46_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P46_S1	Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a statement of financial position.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P46_S2	This standard is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P46_S3	If the Company had adopted this new accounting standard at December 31, 2016, it would have resulted in a reclassification of $1,642 from current deferred income taxes to non-current deferred income taxes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors).
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S1	The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S2	This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S3	A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S4	This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S5	The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S6	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S7	This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S8	The Company is unable to estimate the impact of adoption as it is dependent on the Company s future stock price and future stock option exercises which cannot be predicted.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P47_S9	However, the Company is expecting the adoption of this new accounting standard to have a material impact on net income, basic and diluted income per common share and the effective tax rate especially during the first quarter consistent with the vesting of a majority of its stock awards.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P48_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies and provides guidance on eight cash flow classification issues and is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P48_S1	This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P48_S2	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P48_S3	The adoption of this new accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P49_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P49_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates.

1096376_17_ITEM15_P53_S1	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P53_S2	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P54_S0	The fair values of the Company s Level 1 instruments are based on quoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P54_S1	The Company had no Level 2 or 3 instruments at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

1096376_17_ITEM15_P60_S0	The allocation of the purchase price was to the SBD trade name and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P61_S0	The fair value measurement method used to measure the assets acquired utilized a number of significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 assumptions.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P61_S1	These assumptions included, among others, projections of the acquired businesses future operating results, the implied fair value of assets using an income approach by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis and other subjective assumptions.

1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan is currently the only plan under which new awards may be granted.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S2	Under that plan, a variety of equity instruments can be granted to key employees and directors including incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units or shares of common stock.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S3	The 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorize up to 1,000, 5,600 and 5,400 shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S4	At December 31, 2016, the Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan had 1,047 shares available for grant.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S5	Under each of the plans, the Board of Directors determines the term of each award, but no award can be exercisable more than 10 years from the date the award is granted.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S6	The stock options issued under the Equity Incentive Plans generally expire seven years from the grant date.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S7	The Board also determines the vesting provisions of all awards and the exercise price per share of stock options issued under the plans, which is the fair market value at date of grant.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S8	Awards issued to employees generally vest over terms ranging from two to four years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P86_S9	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity for 2014, 2015 and 2016:
1096376_17_ITEM15_P87_S0	In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded compensation expense of $1,072, $647 and $426, respectively, for stock option awards.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P87_S1	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $5.99, $5.18 and $3.88 , respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P87_S2	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $5,727, $5,520 and $219, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P88_S0	The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:
1096376_17_ITEM15_P89_S0	In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company authorized the issuance of 27, 22 and 27 fully vested shares of common stock, respectively, as compensation to the Board of Directors resulting in compensation expense of $700, $509 and $455, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P89_S1	In addition, in 2014, the Company issued 2 shares of common stock to consultants for services.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P89_S2	No shares were issued to consultants during 2016 or 2015.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P89_S3	Costs recognized for shares issued to non-employees for services were $30 in 2014.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P89_S4	No expense was recognized in 2016 or 2015.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P90_S0	The Company has issued restricted stock to employees generally with vesting terms ranging from two to four years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P90_S1	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P91_S0	Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P91_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for 2014, 2015 and 2016:
1096376_17_ITEM15_P92_S0	Additionally, the Company grants performance-based restricted stock units.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P92_S1	The performance-based units have performance conditions and service-based vesting conditions.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P92_S2	Each vesting tranche is treated as an individual award and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P92_S3	The requisite service period is a combination of the performance period and the subsequent vesting period based on continued service.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P92_S4	The level of achievement of such goals may cause the actual amount of units that ultimately vest to range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P93_S0	The Company recognizes expense ratably over the vesting period for performance-based restricted stock units when it is probable that the performance criteria specified will be achieved.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P94_S0	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P95_S0	The following table summarizes the restricted stock unit activity:
1096376_17_ITEM15_P96_S0	Included in the nonvested restricted stock units as of December 31, 2016 were 26 restricted stock units that vested on December 31, 2016 but the achievement of the performance goals will not be certified as earned by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company until the first quarter of 2017.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P97_S0	The Company recorded compensation expense of $5,198, $4,312 and $4,740 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, in connection with the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P97_S1	As of December 31, 2016, the Company expects 207 shares of restricted stock and 274 restricted stock units to vest.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P97_S2	The Company recognized a decrease/(increase) in taxes payable of $2,936, $2,750 and $(68) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from the exercise of certain stock options, the vesting of restricted stock and payment of certain dividends and recorded these amounts as increases and decreases to additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders equity.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P97_S3	As of December 31, 2016, there was $7,629 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.0 years.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P97_S4	The total unrecognized compensation expense will be fully charged to expense through the fourth quarter of 2019.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P98_S0	The Company maintains a qualified tax deferred defined contribution retirement plan (the Plan ).
1096376_17_ITEM15_P98_S1	Under the provisions of the Plan, substantially all employees meeting minimum age and service requirements are entitled to contribute on a before and after-tax basis a certain percentage of their compensation.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P98_S2	The Company matched 100% of employees first 3% contribution and 50% of the employees next 2% contribution.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P98_S3	Employees vest immediately in their contributions and the Company s contribution.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P98_S4	The Company s contributions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $892, $794 and $748, respectively.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P99_S0	Following is an analysis for the returns reserve which is included as other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets:
1096376_17_ITEM15_P100_S0	The sum of the quarterly basic and diluted per share amounts may not equal amounts reported for the year.
1096376_17_ITEM15_P100_S1	This is due to the effects of rounding and changes in weighted average shares outstanding for each period.

1096376_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths:
1096376_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	We believe most of our customers are very satisfied with our products and believe they have lost weight while using one of our programs.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	Our customer research has found that customers tend to stay on the program for 11 to 12 weeks.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	We have sponsored clinical trials at leading academic centers, including in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	Studies on our Nutrisystem D (diabetes) plan (in combination with counseling sessions) showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss and improvements in HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control), in addition to improvements in secondary endpoints such as waist circumference, total plasma cholesterol and blood pressure.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	We believe that our brands are well recognized in the weight management industry.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Nutrisystem name has been in the weight management industry for more than 45 years, and we estimate that our company and our predecessors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising over that time period.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	The South Beach Diet, created 15 years ago by world-renowned cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston, was a bestseller and has more than 23 million copies in print.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Low Cost, Highly Scalable Model .
1096376_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Unlike traditional commercial weight loss programs, which primarily sell through franchisee and company-owned centers, we primarily generate revenue in our direct channel online and through the telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards).
1096376_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Our method of distribution removes the fixed costs and capital investment associated with diet centers.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	We minimize fixed costs and capital investments in food procurement and fulfillment by outsourcing the production of our food products to a number of vendors.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P17_S3	We also outsource 100% of our fulfillment operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	Our goal is to offer our customers a complete weight loss program that is convenient, private and cost-effective.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Our customers primarily place their orders online or over the telephone and have their food delivered directly to their home.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	This affords our customers the convenience and anonymity that other diets, which rely on weight-loss centers, cannot ensure.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	Additionally, we provide our customers with monthly food packages containing a four-week meal plan consisting of breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks and flex meals, which they supplement, depending on which program they are using, with fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, lean protein and dairy.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	This removes the confusion of reading nutrition labels, measuring portions or counting calories, carbohydrates or points.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	We believe our weight loss programs offer our customers significant value and are priced below those of our competitors.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	In addition, unlike some of our competitors, we do not charge a membership fee.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	We also generate revenue through the sale of our multi-day kits and single items at select retail locations.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	These multi-day kits and single items have expanded our products and consumer reach.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem at a more attractive price point.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Our Industry Weight management is a challenge for a significant portion of the U.S. population, as well as the global population.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	It is estimated that more than one-third (34.9% or 78.6 million) of U.S. adults are obese.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, overweight and obese individuals are increasingly at risk for diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain types of cancer, stroke, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC ) estimates one out of every ten people (30.3 million) have diabetes in the U.S. and more than one out of three adults (84.1 million) have a condition known as prediabetes.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	The CDC estimates 110 million Americans will have diabetes by the year 2050.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P22_S4	However, there is evidence that weight loss may reduce the risk of developing these conditions, as well as improve the health and quality of life of people who have these conditions.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	Competition The weight loss industry is very competitive and consists of pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants, nutritional supplements and surgical procedures.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to traditional center-based competitors, online diet-oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, meal replacement products, as well as medically supervised programs.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	We believe that our principal competitive factors in the weight loss market are:
1096376_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	the ability to attract and retain customers through promotion and personal referral.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Based on these factors, we believe that we can compete effectively in the weight loss industry.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	We, however, have no control over how successful competitors will be in addressing these factors.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	By providing well-recognized food-based weight management programs using the direct channel, we believe that we have a competitive advantage in our market.

1096376_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Two randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed medical journals found the Nutrisystem D Program, in combination with counseling sessions, produced statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in weight, HbA1c (a key measure of blood glucose control), and several other risk factors.

1096376_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	All of our foods and supplements are currently outsourced from more than 35 manufacturers or vendors.

1096376_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	Regardless of a given food item s pathway through de velopment, that food is evaluated for nutrition, compliance with our program, taste and cost considerations.
1096376_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	The number of stock keeping units, or SKUs, we introduce each year varies depending on whether we are introducing a new program or simply updating an existing one.

1096376_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.

1096376_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	If any of the events described below actually occurs, the Company s business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select effective markets and media in which to advertise.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our marketing expenditures were $198.9 million, $152.4 million and $124.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Our future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures, including our ability to:
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	convert consumer inquiries into actual orders.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenue or generate sufficient levels of brand name and program awareness.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	We may not be able to manage our marketing expenditures on a cost-effective basis whereby our customer acquisition costs may exceed the contribution profit generated from each additional customer.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our sales may be adversely impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or prolonged economic slowdown, may reduce the demand for our products and otherwise adversely affect our sales.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	For example, economic forces, including general economic conditions, demographic trends, consumer confidence in the economy, changes in disposable consumer income and/or reductions in discretionary spending, may cause consumers to defer purchases of our programs which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins, and/or our overall financial condition and operating results.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	We rely on third parties to provide us with adequate food supply, freight and fulfillment and Internet and networking services, the loss of any of which could cause our revenue, earnings or reputation to suffer.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Food Manufacturers and Other Suppliers .
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	We rely solely on third-party manufacturers to supply all of the food and other products we sell as well as packaging materials.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P4_S2	In 2017, approximately 12% and 8% of inventory purchases were from two vendors.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantity, quality and variety of food, other products and packaging materials in a timely and low-cost manner from our manufacturers, we will be unable to fulfill our customers orders in a timely manner, which may cause us to lose revenue and market share or incur higher costs, as well as damage the value of our brands.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In 2017, 100% of our order fulfillment was handled by one third-party provider.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Also, more than 98% of our direct to consumer orders were shipped by one third-party provider and more than 98% of our orders for retail programs were shipped by another third-party provider.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Should these providers be unable to service our needs for even a short duration, our revenue and business could be harmed.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Additionally, the cost and time associated with replacing these providers on short notice would add to our costs.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Any replacement fulfillment provider would also require startup time, which could cause us to lose sales and market share.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S6	Our business also depends on a number of third parties for Internet access and networking, and we have limited control over these third parties.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Should our network connections go down, our ability to fulfill orders would be delayed.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Further, if our websites or call center become unavailable for a noticeable period of time due to Internet or communication failures, our business could be adversely affected, including harm to our brands and loss of sales.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The refore, we are dependent on maintaining good relationships with these third parties.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	The services we require from these parties may be disrupted by a number of factors associated with their businesses, including the following:
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	with respect to our food suppliers, shortages of ingredients or USDA or United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) compliance issues.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We may be subject to claims that our personnel are unqualified to provide proper weight loss advice.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	We offer counseling options from weight loss counselors, registered dietitians and certified diabetes educators with varying levels of training.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	We may be subject to claims from our customers alleging that our personnel lack the qualifications necessary to provide proper advice regarding weight loss and related topics.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	We may also be subject to claims that our personnel have provided inappropriate advice or have inappropriately referred or failed to refer customers to health care providers for matters other than weight loss.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Such claims could result in lawsuits, damage to our reputation and divert management s attention from our business, which would adversely affect our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S5	We may be subject to health or advertising related claims from our customers.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our weight loss programs do not include medical treatment or medical advice, and we do not engage physicians or nurses to monitor the progress of our customers.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Many people who are overweight suffer from other physical conditions, and our target consumers could be considered a high-risk population.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S8	A customer who experiences health problems could allege or bring a lawsuit against us on the basis that those problems were caused or worsened by participating in our weight management programs or by consuming one or more of our individual products.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S9	For example, our predecessor businesses suffered substantial losses due to health-related claims and related publicity.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Further, customers who allege that they were deceived by any statements that we made in advertising or labeling could bring a lawsuit against us under consumer protection laws.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Currently, we are neither subject to any such allegations nor have we been named in any such litigation.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S12	If we were subject to any such claims, while we would defend ourselves against such claims, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in our defense.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S13	Also, defending ourselves against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, would likely be lengthy and costly, and adversely affect our results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P8_S14	Further, our general liability insurance may not cover claims of these types.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The weight management industry is highly competitive.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If any of our competitors or a new entrant into the market with significant resources pursues a weight management program similar to ours, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	Competition is intense in the weight management industry and we must remain competitive in the areas of program efficacy, price, taste, customer service and brand recognition.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Our competitors include companies selling pharmaceutical products and weight loss programs, digital tools and wearable trackers, as well as a wide variety of diet foods and meal replacement bars and shakes, appetite suppressants and nutritional supplements.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Some of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater resources.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Our business could be adversely affected if someone with significant resources decided to imitate our weight management programs.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S6	For example, if a major supplier of pre-packaged foods decided to enter this market and made a substantial investment of resources in advertising and training diet counselors, our business could be significantly affected.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P9_S7	Any increased competition from new entrants into our industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales or prices, or both, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	We are dependent on certain third-party agreements for a percentage of revenue.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	We have contractual agreements with certain third-party retailers.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Under the agreements, these third parties control when and how often our products are offered and we are not guaranteed any minimum level of sales.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	If any third party elects not to renew their agreement with us or reduces the promotion of our products, our revenue will suffer.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	to stop selling our products upon written notice, which may result in an increased level of reclamation claims.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	In the event any retailer terminates its relationship with us and the level of reclamation claims exceeds the estimated amoun t reserved on our balance sheet at the time of sale to the retailer, we will have to record an expense for the excess claims, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Additionally, in certain instances, we could be pr ohibited from selling our products through competitors of these third parties for a specified time after the termination of the agreements.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	New weight loss products or services may put us at a competitive disadvantage.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	On an ongoing basis, many existing and potential providers of weight loss solutions, including many pharmaceutical firms with significantly greater financial and operating resources than we have, are developing new products and services.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	The creation of a weight loss solution, such as a drug therapy, that is perceived to be safe, effective and easier than a portion-controlled meal plan would put us at a disadvantage in the marketplace and our results of operations could be negatively affected.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P12_S3	We may be subject to litigation from our competitors.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P12_S4	Our competitors may pursue litigation against us based on our advertising or other marketing practices regardless of its merit and chances of success, especially if we engage in comparative advertising, which includes advertising that directly or indirectly mentions a competitor or a competitor s weight loss program in comparison to our programs.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P12_S5	While we would defend ourselves against any such claims, our defense may ultimately be unsuccessful.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Also, defending against such claims, regardless of their merit and ultimate outcome, may be lengthy and costly, strain our resources and divert management s attention from their core responsibilities, which would have a negative impact on our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Unauthorized users who penetrate our information security could misappropriate proprietary or customer information or data or cause interruptions to the product offerings on our websites.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, it may become necessary to expend significant additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized users.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P13_S3	These expenditures, however, may not prove to be a timely remedy against unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	A significant number of states require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Additional states and governmental entities are considering such notice laws.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we experience a security breach and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and utilize proprietary and customer information and data.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Privacy concerns among prospective and existing customers regarding our use of such information or data collected on our websites or through our services and products, such as weight management information, financial data, email addresses and home addresses, could keep them from using our websites or purchasing our services or products.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We currently face certain legal obligations regarding the manner in which we treat such information and data.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for their use and handling of such information and data.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Currently, a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit cards directly for fees charged by us.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S5	We rely on third-party software products to secure our credit card transactions.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S6	Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent payment transactions and other security breaches, failure to prevent or mitigate such fraud or breaches or changes in industry standards or regulations may adversely affect our business and operating results or cause us to lose our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment and result in chargebacks of the fraudulently charged amounts.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S7	Furthermore, widespread credit card fraud may lessen our customers willingness to purchase our products on our websites.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S8	We may experience fluctuations in our operating results which may cause our stock price to be volatile.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Our business is seasonal, with revenue generally greatest in the first calendar quarter and weakest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S11	The market price of our common stock is subject to fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends in the weight loss industry, announcements by our competitors, our ability to meet or exceed securities analysts expectations, recommendations by securities analysts, the condition of the financial markets and other factors.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P15_S12	These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and cause it to fluctuate significantly.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Acquisitions and the pursuit of new business opportunities present risks, and we may be unable to achieve the financial and strategic goals of any acquisition or new business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	A component of our growth strategy has been and may continue to be to acquire existing businesses or pursue other business opportunities in the market for weight management and fitness products and other complimentary products and services.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These types of transactions will face a number of risks and uncertainties, including:
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or of the commencement of any new business may not be realized, in which event we will not be able to achieve any return on our investment in that new business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Consummating these transactions could also result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, as well as unforeseen contingent liabilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We may also issue additional equity in connection with these transactions, which would dilute our existing stockholders.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	We have and expect to continue to launch new weight loss programs and brands which may not be successful due to the failure of such programs or brands to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There are a number of risks inherent in any new program or brand introduction, which could prevent us from achieving revenue growth and increasing our overall market share in the commercial weight loss market.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Any new program or brand may fail to achieve the anticipated level of market acceptance or appeal to consumer tastes and preferences.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, introduction costs, including product testing and marketing, may be greater than anticipated.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	If the new program or brand is not successful or falls short of anticipated market acceptance, we may be adversely affected by continued expenses and the diversion of management time to this initiative.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Any or all of such events could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If we do not continue to receive referrals from existing customers, our customer acquisition cost may increase.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	We rely on word-of-mouth advertising for a portion of our new customers.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	If our brands suffer or the number of customers acquired through referrals drops due to other circumstances, our costs associated with acquiring new customers and generating revenue will increase, which will, in turn, have an adverse effect on our profitability.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We use third-party marketing vendors to promote our products.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If the spokespersons affiliated with the third-party marketing vendors suffer adverse publicity or elect to not renew, our revenue could be adversely affected.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our marketing strategy depends in part on celebrity spokespersons, as well as customer spokespersons, to promote our weight loss programs.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any of these spokespersons may become the subject of adverse news reports, negative publicity or otherwise be alienated from a segment of our customer base, whether weight loss related or not.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	If so, such events may reduce the effectiveness of his or her endorsement and, in turn, adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Additionally, if a spokesperson elects not to renew their agreement with us, our revenue may suffer.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Third parties may infringe on our brands, trad emarks and other intellectual property rights, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We currently rely on a combination of trademark and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including our brands.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, the value of our brands, services and products could be diminished and our business may suffer.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brands and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property, especially in Internet-related businesses, are uncertain and evolving.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	We cannot assure you that these evolving legal standards will sufficiently protect our intellectual property rights in the future.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S7	We may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S8	Third parties may in the future make claims against us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S9	Any intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could significantly divert management s attention from other business concerns.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S10	In addition, if we were unable to successfully defend against such claims, we may have to pay damages, stop selling the service or product or stop using the software, technology or content found to be in violation of a third party s rights, seek a license for the infringing service, product, software, technology or content or develop alternative non-infringing services, products, software, technology or content.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S11	If we cannot license on reasonable terms, develop alternatives or stop using the service, product, software, technology or content for any infringing aspects of our business, we may be forced to limit our service and product offerings.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P21_S12	Any of these results could reduce our revenue and our ability to compete effectively, increase our costs or harm our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Our credit agreement contains financial and other covenants.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The failure to comply with such covenants could have an adverse effect on us.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (applicable if there are outstanding borrowings), and limitations on, among other things, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions, consolidations and sales of assets.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit agreement may result in an event of default under the agreement.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We are dependent on our key executive officers for future success.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If we lose the services of any of our key executive officers and we are unable to timely retain a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	The loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	If any key executive officers left us or were seriously injured and became unable to work, our business could be harmed.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Provisions in our certificate of incorporation may deter or delay an acquisition of us or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition or a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Provisions of our certificate of incorporation (as amended) may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us, even if our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P24_S8	In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Our certificate of incorporation (as amended) permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval upon such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The rights of the holders of our common stock will be junior to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding common stock.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The issuance of a substantial number of preferred shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	Changes in consumer preferences could negatively impact our operating results.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	Our programs feature frozen and ready-to-go food selections, which we believe offer convenience and value to our customers.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Our continued success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued popularity of our programs versus various other weight loss, weight management and fitness regimens, such as low carbohydrate diets, appetite suppressants and diets featured in the published media.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	failure to provide innovative responses to these changes, may have a materia lly adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Our success is also dependent on our food innovation including maintaining a robust array of food items and improving the quality of existing items.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If we do not continually expand our food items or provide customers with items that are desirable in taste and quality, our business could be harmed.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The weight loss industry is subject to adverse publicity, which could harm our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The weight loss industry receives adverse publicity from time to time, and the occurrence of such publicity could harm us, even if the adverse publicity is not directly related to us.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In the early 1990s, our predecessor businesses were subject to extremely damaging adverse publicity relating to a large number of lawsuits alleging that the Nutrisystem weight loss program in use at that time led to gall bladder disease.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This publicity was a factor that contributed to the bankruptcy of our predecessor businesses in 1993.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S7	In addition, our predecessor businesses were severely impacted by significant litigation and damaging publicity related to their customers use of fen-phen as an appetite suppressant, which the FDA ordered withdrawn from the market in September 1997.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S8	The significant decline in business resulting from the fen-phen problems caused our predecessor businesses to close all of their company-owned weight loss centers.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S9	Congressional hearings about practices in the weight loss industry have also resulted in adverse publicity and a consequent decline in the revenue of weight loss businesses.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S10	Future research reports or publicity that is perceived as unfavorable or that question certain weight loss programs, products or methods could result in a decline in our revenue.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S11	Because of our dependence on consumer perceptions, adverse publicity associated with illness or other undesirable effects resulting from the consumption of our products or similar products by competitors, whether or not accurate, could also damage customer confidence in our weight loss program and result in a decline in revenue.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P26_S12	Adverse publicity could arise even if the unfavorable effects associated with weight loss products or services resulted from the user s failure to use such products or services appropriately.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Our industry is subject to governmental regulation that could increase in severity and hurt results of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our industry is subject to federal, state and other governmental regulation.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Certain federal and state agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC ), regulate and enforce such laws relating to advertising, disclosures to consumers, privacy, consumer pricing and billing arrangements and other consumer protection matters.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	A determination by a federal or state agency, or a court, that any of our practices do not meet existing or new laws or regulations could result in liability, adverse publicity and restrictions on our business operations.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Some advertising practices in the weight loss industry, in particular, have led to investigations from time to time by the FTC and other governmental agencies and many companies in the weight loss industry, including our predecessor businesses, have entered into consent decrees with the FTC relating to weight loss claims and other advertising practices.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	In addition, the FTC s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising require us and other weight loss companies to use a statement as to what the typical weight loss a customer can expect to achieve on our programs when using a customer s weight loss testimonial in advertising.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Federal and state regulation of advertising practices generally, and in the weight loss industry in particular, may increase in scope or severity in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Other aspects of our industry are also subject to government regulation.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	For example, the manufacturing, labeling and distribution of food products, including dietary supplements, are subject to strict USDA and FDA requirements and food manufacturers are subject to rigorous inspection and other requirements of the USDA and FDA, and companies operating in foreign markets must comply with those countries requirements for proper labeling, controls on hygiene, food preparation and other matters.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	If federal, state, local or foreign regulation of our industry increases for any reason, then we may be required to incur significant expenses, as well as modify our operations to comply with new regulatory requirements, which could harm our operating results.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Additionally, remedies available in any potential administrative or regulatory actions may include product recalls and requiring us to refund amounts paid by all affected customers or pay other damages, which could be substantial.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Laws and regulations directly applicable to communications, operations or commerce over the Internet such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel and taxation, are becoming more prevalent and some remain unsettled.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If we are required to comply with new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or if we are unable to comply with these laws, regulations or interpretations, our business could be adversely affected.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Future laws or regulations, including laws or regulations affecting our marketing and advertising practices, relations with consumers, employees, service providers, or our services and products, may have an adverse impact on us.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The sale of ingested products involves product liability and other risks.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Like other distributors of products that are ingested, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products results in illness or injury.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	The foods that we resell in the U.S. are subject to laws and regulations, including those administered by the USDA and FDA that establish manufacturing practices and quality standards for food products.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business as existing insurance coverage may not be adequate.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Distributors of weight loss food products, including dietary supplements, as well as our predecessor businesses, have been named as defendants in product liability lawsuits from time to time.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The successful assertion or settlement of an uninsured claim, a significant number of insured claims or a claim exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage would harm us by adding costs to the business and by diverting the attention of senior management from the operation of the business.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	We may also be subject to claims that our products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled, include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings covering interactions with other substances.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Product liability litigation, even if not meritorious, is very expensive and could also entail adverse publicity for us and reduce our revenue.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In addition, the products we distribute, or certain components of those products, may be subject to product recalls or other deficiencies.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Any negative publicity associated with these actions would adversely affect our brand and may result in decreased product sales and, as a result, lower revenue and profits.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P34_S5	The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse effect on our net income.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ) was signed into law.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	We are continuing to analyze the Tax Act and its possible effects on us, including on our subsidiaries.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The Tax Act reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, among other things, which has caused us to write-down a portion of our deferred tax assets.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex and could be subject to further interpretation.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the amounts provided elsewhere in this report, possibly materially, and our expectation of our future effective tax rate may also differ, due to changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act or any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act.
1096376_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Based on these factors we cannot determine at this time the full effects of the Tax Act on our business and future financial results.
1096376_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	We currently lease one location in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.
1096376_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	This location totals 119,767 square feet of office space and our lease expires in 2022.
1096376_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	Our fulfillment capacity is located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Bethlehem, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; Troy, Illinois and Sparks, Nevada through an outsourced provider.
1096376_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	We have no lease obligations to our outsourced fulfillment provider; however, we are subject to minimum space commitments which we may reduce over a specified period of time.
1096376_18_ITEM2_P0_S4	Management believes our outsourced fulfillment capacity is adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future.
1096376_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in various claims and routine litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1096376_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcomes of such matters are not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future years and management believes the range of reasonably possible losses from current matters is immaterial .
1096376_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	Market Information The Company s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market, under the symbol NTRI.

1096376_18_ITEM5_P4_S3	The timing, number and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by us at our discretion and will be based on a number of factors including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions, the trading price of the common stock, regulatory requirements and compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.

1096376_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The selected consolidated financial data presented below has been derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements for each of the periods indicated.

1096376_18_ITEM6_P1_S0	In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a charge of $836 to write-down our net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the future federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Act.
1096376_18_ITEM6_P1_S1	Additionally, we recorded a valuation allowance of $817 as certain state net operating loss carryforwards might not be realized due to changes in tax legislation.
1096376_18_ITEM6_P2_S0	In 2016, we recorded a charge of $1,297 to write-down certain software licenses that were no longer expected to be used as more enhanced software options were available to handle our evolving business needs.
1096376_18_ITEM6_P3_S0	In 2013, a charge of $5,000 was recorded to settle certain disputes that had arisen with a supplier over a legacy contract.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	Background We provide weight management products and services, including nutritionally balanced weight loss programs sold primarily online and over the telephone and multi-day kits and single items available at select retail locations.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	The weight loss programs are designed for women and men.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S2	Additionally, our Nutrisystem D program is designed specifically to help people with Type 2 diabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes, who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S3	Our programs are based on over 45 years of nutrition research.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S4	Our food is created to be nutritious, delicious and portioned for weight loss and management.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S5	Our pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network, and select retailers.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S6	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P1_S7	For 2017, 2016 and 2015, the direct channel accounted for 92%, 91% and 90%, respectively, of revenue compared to 6%, 6% and 8%, respectively, for retail and 2%, 3% and 2%, respectively, for QVC.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	We incur significant marketing expenditures to support our brands as we continue to advertise across various media channels.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	New media channels are tested on a continual basis and we consider our media mix to be diverse.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	We market our weight loss systems through television, print, direct mail, Internet, public relations and social media.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	We review and analyze a number of key operating and financial metrics to manage our business, including the number of new customers, revenue per customer, reactivation revenue, total revenue, marketing per new customer and operating margins.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	Our ecommerce, direct-to-consumer business model provides flexibility which allows us to manage marketing spend according to customer demand.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S5	We believe this flexibility is especially valuable as it allows us to react to changing market conditions relatively quickly.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S6	Additionally, we are continually looking to make investments to improve lifetime customer economics, length of stay and overall customer satisfaction.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S7	We are able to test new commercials, offers and website configurations to allow us to be more responsive to customer needs and attempt to drive conversion.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S8	Customers are given a meal plan and access to weight loss trackers and tools, educational digital content and exercise suggestions.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P2_S9	Customers are also encouraged to check in periodically with a counselor as their needs change in response to weight loss.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	In December 2016, we announced our multi-brand approach with two distinct programs, the clinically-tested Nutrisystem Lean13 and the South Beach Diet .
1096376_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	The South Beach Diet launched in January 2017 as a structured meal delivery weight-loss program.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	The plan features fully prepared, globally inspired meals that are flash-frozen to maintain the quality of taste and nutrition, and delivered right to the customer s doorstep.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The South Beach Diet was created by Dr. Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist from southern Florida.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	In 2003, he published The South Beach Diet, which became a bestseller with more than 23 million copies in print and multiple titles appearing on the New York Times bestseller list.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Additionally, our multi-day weight loss kits are available at select retailers.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S3	The retail channel provides us with great brand exposure, offering consumers who may not be aware of our programs an opportunity to sample Nutrisystem programs and products at a more attractive price point.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S4	Also, we continue to offer our Nutrisystem programs through the use of prepaid gift cards at Costco.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S5	We are actively developing our retail product pipeline and have multiple kits and single items available for purchase.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S6	We believe these new product and program innovations are resonating well with our customers.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S7	We provide an increasingly diverse array of weight loss solutions for our customers through an expanding portfolio of products.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S8	Our customers now have greater flexibility in choosing between ready-to-go and frozen options, with no restrictions.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S9	We believe this translates into higher customer satisfaction and more profit.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S10	We have expanded our television and digital reach to both introduce ourselves to new consumers and build brand awareness and to start testing expansion opportunities.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S11	Upsell and a la carte sales, including shakes and additional flexible options have continued to grow as more people are adding them to their orders.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S12	Revenue for 2017 increased 28% from 2016 to $697.0 million.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S13	Our revenue growth was attributable primarily to the direct channel due to revenue from new customers in their initial diet cycle, the reactivation of former customers and increased sales of our premium products.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S14	Reactivation revenue increased due to higher volumes building off of recent increases in new customer counts and a higher reactivation rate.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P4_S15	QVC and retail revenue also increased in 2017 compared to 2016.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	Our significant accounting policies, including the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	Management develops, and changes periodically, these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The accounting estimates we consider critical include reserves for returns and excess and obsolete inventory.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	These critical accounting estimates are discussed with our audit committee quarterly.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	We review the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjust them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	To estimate reserves for returns, we consider actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P6_S4	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, we will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P6_S5	The provision for estimated returns for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $19.0 million, $14.9 million and $13.2 million, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P6_S6	The reserve for estimated returns incurred but not received and processed was $868,000 and $740,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and has been included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	We continually assess the quantities of inventory on hand to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	We estimate the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecasted demand and/or our ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in our customers behavior.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $1.9 million and $1.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	Results of Operations Revenue and expenses consist of the following components: Revenue.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	Food sales include sales of food, supplements, shipping and handling charges billed to customers and sales credits and adjustments, including product returns.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	Revenue from the retail programs is also net of any trade allowances, reclamation reserves or broker commissions.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	No revenue is recorded for food products provided at no charge as part of promotions.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S5	Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the products sold, including compensation related to fulfillment, the costs of outside fulfillment, incoming and outgoing shipping costs, charge card fees and packing material.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S6	Cost of products sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S7	Marketing expense includes media, advertising production, marketing and promotional expenses and payroll-related expenses, including share-based payment arrangements, for personnel engaged in these activities.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S8	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S9	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertisements and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S10	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S11	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S12	General and administrative expense consists of compensation for administrative, information technology, call center and sales personnel, share-based payment arrangements for related employees, facility expenses, website development costs, professional service fees and other general corporate expenses.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P8_S14	We are subject to corporate level income taxes and record income taxes based on an effective income tax rate for the year.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Overview of the Direct Channel In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the direct channel represented 92%, 91% and 90%, respectively, of our revenue.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	Revenue through the direct channel was $643.0 million in 2017 compared to $498.2 million in 2016 and $415.8 million in 2015.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P9_S2	Revenue is generated primarily through customer starts, reactivation of former customers and the customer ordering behavior, including length of time on our program and the diet program selection.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P9_S3	The revenue increase in 2017 was attributable primarily to revenue from new customers in their initial diet cycle, reactivation revenue and increased sales of our premium products.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	Critical to increasing customer starts is our ability to deploy marketing dollars while maintaining marketing effectiveness.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	Factors influencing our marketing effectiveness include the quality of the advertisements, promotional activity by our competitors, as well as the price and availability of appropriate media.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Revenue increased to $697.0 million in 2017 from $545.5 million in 2016.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The increase in revenue is attributable primarily to revenue from new customers in their initial diet cycle ($107.5 million), reactivation revenue ($37.8 million) and retail revenue ($5.2 million).

1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S5	Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 53.9% in 2017 from 52.9% in 2016.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S6	The increase in gross margin was attributable primarily to lower food costs from the direct channel, less promotional costs from retail and increases in average selling prices which offset increased packaging and freight costs due to increased sales of our frozen products.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S7	Marketing expense increased to $198.9 million in 2017 from $152.4 million in 2016.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S8	Marketing expense as a percent of revenue increased to 28.5% in 2017 from 27.9% in 2016.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S9	Substantially all of the marketing spending in 2017 promoted the direct business.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S10	The increase in marketing expense was attributable to increased spending for media ($46.9 million) primarily for short form television media and Internet advertising, marketing compensation and benefits ($1.9 million) partially offset by decreases in television production ($1.6 million) and public relations ($632,000).
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S11	In total, media spending was $177.4 million in 2017 and $130.5 million in 2016.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S13	The increase in spending was attributable primarily to higher compensation and benefits ($5.5 million), an increase in non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements ($3.1 million) and higher spending for professional, outside and computer services ($2.3 million).
1096376_18_ITEM7_P11_S14	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in program and product costs ($916,000).
1096376_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Deprecia tion and amortization expense increased to $15.1 million in 2017 from $13.7 million in 2016 due to increased capital expenditures for our websites, digital tools and our new warehouses.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	Interest income, net, was $119,000 in 2017 compared to $26,000 in interest expense, net in 2016, due to higher interest income and a lower amount of amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	In 2017, we recorded income tax expense at $25.7 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 30.7%, as compared to $18.5 million in 2016 with an effective tax rate of 34.3%.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, as of January 1, 2017, we recognized an excess tax benefit from share-based compensation of $5.5 million within income tax expense rather than as additional paid-in capital under previous accounting guidance.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	This benefit was partially offset by a charge of $836,000 to write-down our net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	Additionally, at December 31, 2017, we recorded a valuation allowance of $817,000 as certain state net operating loss carryforwards might not be realized due to changes in tax legislation.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P13_S6	The increase in gross margin was attributable primarily to increases in average selling prices and lower food costs partially offset by increased packaging and freight costs due to the increased sales of the frozen products.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase in spending was attributable primarily to higher compensation and benefits ($3.0 million), an increase in spending for computer services ($2.2 million) and higher non-cash expense for share-based payment arrangements ($1.3 million).
1096376_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional and outside services ($2.1 million) due prim arily to costs incurred with the acquisition of the SBD brand in 2015 and a decrease in program and product innovation ($358,000) as the packaging redesign was completed.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $13.7 million in 2016 from $9.2 million in 2015 due to increased capital expenditures for our websites, digital tools and our new warehouse, as well as a charge of $1.3 million to write-down certain software licenses that were no longer expected to be used as more enhanced software options were available to handle our evolving business needs.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P14_S4	Additionally, we incurred amortization expense of $1.0 million in 2016 associated with the acquisition of the SBD brand in December 2015.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P14_S5	Interest expense, net, was $26,000 in 2016 compared to $169,000 in 2015, due to a lower amount of amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P14_S6	In 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $18.5 million, which reflects an effective tax rate of 34.3%, as compared to $13.7 million in 2015 with an effective tax rate of 34.4%.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures, we anticipate continuing requirements for capital expenditures.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Following is a summary of our contractual obligations.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	We have entered into agreements with various food suppliers.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	These agreements may provide for annual pricing, annual purchase obligations, exclusivity in the production of certain products, as well as rebates if certain volume thresholds are exceeded, with terms of five years or less.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	We anticipate we will meet all annual purchase obligations.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P16_S7	Our principal sources of liquidity during 2017 were cash flows from operations.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	On November 6, 2015, we entered into a $50.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a lender.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	The credit facility provides for interest on borrowings at either a base rate or the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin and is also subject to an unused fee payable quarterly.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase in cash flows from operations was attributable primarily to an increase in net income of $22.4 million.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S2	In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $37.3 million, an increase of $8.0 million from 2016 as we invested additional amounts in short term investments.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S3	Capital additions decreased by $1.3 million as compared to 2016 as the prior year included additions for the launch of the South Beach Diet and additional ecommerce projects.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S4	In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $27.4 million, an increase of $9.6 million from 2016, due primarily to increased stock repurchases.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S5	We paid $21.4 million for the payment of dividends, $5.8 million for share repurchases and $4.5 million to satisfy the tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of equity awards partially offset by $4.3 million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S6	We had a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock which expired on November 3, 2017.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S7	On October 25, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a new share repurchase program to replace it.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S8	We may repurchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock over a 24-month period commencing November 4, 2017.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S9	The timing, number and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by us at our discretion and will be based on a number of factors including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions, the trading price of the common stock, regulatory requirements and compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S10	The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S11	During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased and subsequently retired 28,675 shares of common stock under these programs for an aggregate cost of $1.5 million.

1096376_18_ITEM7_P18_S16	We believe that our available capital resources are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations and dividends for the foreseeable future.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Typically, in the weight loss industry, revenue is greatest in the first calendar quarter and weakest in the fourth quarter.
1096376_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	We believe our business experiences seasonality, driven primarily by the predisposition of dieters to initiate a diet at certain times of the year and the placement of our advertising, which is based on the price and availability of certain media at such times.
1096376_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	We believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk instruments.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P7_S2	Additionally, the Nutrisystem D program is designed specifically to help people with Type 2 diabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight and manage their diabetes.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P8_S0	The Nutrisystem programs are based on over 45 years of nutrition research.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P9_S0	The Company s pre-packaged foods are sold directly to weight loss program participants primarily through the Internet and telephone (including the redemption of prepaid gift cards), referred to as the direct channel, through QVC, a television shopping network, and select retailers.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P9_S1	Approximately 99% of revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was generated in the United States.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P11_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, demand accounts and money market funds comprised all of the Company s cash and cash equivalents.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P12_S0	Short term investments consist of investments in government and agency securities and corporate debt securities with original maturities between three months and three years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P12_S1	The Company classifies these investments as available-for-sale securities.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P12_S2	These investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity, net of related tax effects.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P13_S0	The Company evaluates its investments for other-than-temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis and the Company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery of the market value.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P13_S1	There were no other-than-temporary impairments in 2017, 2016 or 2015.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P14_S0	Inventories Inventories consist principally of packaged food held in outside fulfillment locations.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P14_S1	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P14_S2	Quantities of inventory on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P14_S3	The reserve is estimated for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on forecasted demand and/or the Company s ability to sell the products, introduction of new products, future production requirements and changes in customers behavior.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P14_S4	The reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was $1,945 and $1,260 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P14_S5	Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P15_S0	Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which are generally two to seven years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P16_S0	Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease term.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P16_S1	Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P17_S0	Included in fixed assets is the capitalized cost of internal-use software and website development incurred during the applicat ion development stage.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P17_S1	Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally two to five years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P18_S0	Costs incurred related to planning or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are charged to expense as incurred.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P18_S1	The net book value of capitalized software was $16,419 and $17,868 at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P18_S2	During 2016, the Company determined certain software licenses were no longer expected to be used as more enhanced software options were available to handle its evolving business needs and a charge of $1,297 was recorded to write-down these assets.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P18_S3	The charge was recorded as depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P19_S0	Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of a trade name from the acquisition of the South Beach Diet ( SBD ) brand in December 2015 and domain names (see Note 6).
1096376_18_ITEM15_P19_S1	The trade name is presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P19_S2	The domain names have indefinite lives and are not being amortized but are reviewed for impairment.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P20_S0	Long-Lived Assets The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P20_S1	Long-lived assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P20_S2	When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived assets is used to measure recoverability.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P20_S3	If any impairment is indicated, measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset, generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2017, management believes that no reductions to the remaining useful lives or write-downs of long-lived assets are required.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P22_S0	Revenue Recognition Revenue from direct to consumer product sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete, which is upon transfer of title to the product.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P22_S1	Recognition of revenue upon shipment meets the revenue recognition criteria in that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P22_S2	The Company also sells prepaid gift cards to wholesalers.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P22_S3	Revenue from these cards is recognized after the card is redeemed online at the Company s website or via telephone by the customer and the product is shipped to the customer.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P22_S4	Revenue from the retail programs is recognized when the product is received at the seller s location.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P22_S5	Deferred revenue consists primarily of unredeemed prepaid gift cards and unshipped foods.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P23_S0	When a customer orders the frozen program, two separate shipments are delivered.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P23_S1	One contains Nutrisystem s ready-to-go food and the other contains the frozen food.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P23_S2	Both shipments qualify as separate units of accounting and the fair value is based on estimated selling prices of both units.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S0	Nutrisystem s direct to consumer customers may return unopened ready-to-go products within 30 days of purchase in order to receive a refund or credit.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S1	Frozen products are non-returnable and non-refundable unless the first food order is canceled within 14 days of delivery.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S2	Estimated returns are accrued at the time the sale is recognized and actual returns are tracked monthly.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S3	The Company reviews the reserves for customer returns at each reporting period and adjusts them to reflect data available at that time.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S4	To estimate reserves for returns, the Company considers actual return rates in preceding periods and changes in product offerings or marketing methods that might impact returns going forward.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S5	To the extent the estimate of returns changes, the Company will adjust the reserve, which will impact the amount of revenue recognized in the period of the adjustment.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S6	Revenue from product sales includes amounts billed for shipping and handling and is presented net of estimated returns and billed sales tax.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S7	Revenue from the retail programs is also net of any trade allowances, reclamation reserves or broker commissions.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S8	Revenue from shipping and handling charges was $7,295, $2,869 and $2,561 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P24_S9	The increase in shipping and handling from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to the increased volume of orders and an additional handling charge paid by the customer.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P25_S0	Shipping-related costs are included in cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P26_S0	Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the products sold, including compensation related to fulfillment, the costs of outside fulfillment, incoming and outgoing shipping costs, charge card fees and packing material.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P26_S1	Cost of products sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P26_S2	Dependence on Suppliers In 2017, approximately 12% and 8% of inventory purchases were from two suppliers.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P26_S3	The Company has a supply arrangement with one of these suppliers that requires the Company to make minimum purchases.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P26_S4	In 2016, these suppliers each provided approximately 11% of inventory purchases and in 2015, approximately 17% and 19% of inventory purchases (see Note 8).
1096376_18_ITEM15_P26_S5	The Company outsources 100% of its fulfillment operations to a third-party provider.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P26_S6	Additionally, more than 98% of its direct to consumer orders are shipped by one third-party provider and more than 98% of its orders for the retail programs are shipped by another third-party provider.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P27_S0	Supplier Rebates Two of the Company s suppliers provide for rebates based on purchasing levels.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P27_S1	The Company accounts for these rebates on an accrual basis as purchases are made at a rebate percentage determined based upon the estimated total purchases from the supplier.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P27_S2	The estimated rebate is recorded as a receivable from the supplier with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of purchased inventory and is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations when the associated inventory is sold.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P27_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company reduced cost of revenue for these rebates by $486, $75 and $698, respectively.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P29_S0	Internet advertising expense is recorded based on either the rate of delivery of a guaranteed number of impressions over the advertising contract term or on a cost per customer acquired, depending upon the terms.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P29_S1	Direct-mail advertising costs are capitalized if the primary purpose was to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertisements and results in probable future economic benefits.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P29_S2	The capitalized costs are amortized to expense over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P29_S3	Typically, this period falls within 50 days of the initial direct mailing.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P29_S4	All other advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P29_S5	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $3,426 and $2,155, respectively, of costs have been prepaid for future advertisements and promotions.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P30_S1	Lease Related Expenses Certain of the Company s lease contracts contain rent holidays, various escalation clauses or landlord/tenant incentives.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P30_S2	The Company records rental costs, including costs related to fixed rent escalation clauses and rent holidays, on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P31_S0	Lease allowances utilized for space improvement are recorded as leasehold improvement assets and amortized over the shorter of the economic useful life of the asset or the lease term.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P31_S1	Tenant lease incentive allowances received are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P31_S2	Included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is $1,576 of a tenant improvement allowance at December 31, 2017, of which $345 is included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $1,231 in non-current liabilities.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P31_S3	At December 31, 2016, the tenant improvement allowance was $1,921, of which $345 was included in other accrued expenses and current liabilities and $1,576 in non-current liabilities.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P32_S0	Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P33_S0	in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P34_S0	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recogniz ed in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P35_S0	In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax a ssets will not be realized.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P35_S1	A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P35_S2	The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P36_S0	The Company records accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of interest (income) expense, net.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P37_S0	The Company is managed and operated as one business.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P37_S1	The entire business is managed by a single management team that reports to the chief executive officer.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P37_S2	Revenue consists primarily of food sales.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P38_S0	The Company uses the two-class method to calculate earnings per share ( EPS ) as the unvested restricted stock issued under the Company s equity incentive plans are participating shares with nonforfeitable rights to dividends.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P39_S0	Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P39_S1	In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the number of weighted average shares outstanding during the period.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P39_S2	Undistributed losses are not allocated to unvested restricted stock as the restricted stockholders are not obligated to share in the losses.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P40_S0	The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P41_S0	In 2017, 2016 and 2015, common stock equivalents representing 146, 335 and 229 shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from weighted average shares outstanding for diluted income per common share purposes because the effect would be anti-dilutive or the minimum performance requirements for such common stock equivalents have not yet been met.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P42_S0	The cost of all share-based awards to employees and non-employees, including grants of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units, is recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards at grant date.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P43_S0	The fair value of stock option awards is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model on the date of grant.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P43_S1	The fair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock unit awards is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P43_S2	The fair value of share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P43_S3	The Company relies primarily upon historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures and recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis from the date of grant over the requisite service period except for performance-based units which are recognized on a straight-line basis based on the probable expected performance to be achieved and adjusted accordingly if performance varies.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P44_S0	The Company issues new shares upon exercise of stock options, granting of restricted stock or vesting of restricted stock units.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P45_S0	Cash Flow Information The Company made payments for income taxes of $28,547, $14,175 and $13,508 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P45_S1	Interest payments in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $210, $171 and $182, respectively.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S0	No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ( ASU 2014-09 ).
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S1	ASU 2014-09 outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S2	This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S3	The new model will require an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S4	It also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S5	This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period and should be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S6	The Company has completed its analysis of the new revenue standard and adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method by recognizing the cumulative effect as an adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders equity at January 1, 2018.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S7	Therefore, the comparative information for years ended prior to January 1, 2018 will not be restated to comply with the ASU.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S8	The Company applied the transition practical expedient to only assess contracts that are not completed contracts at the date of initial application when applying the cumulative effect method.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S9	The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognition for transactions with customers in the direct or retail channels.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S10	The adoption of this standard will have an impact on the timing of revenue recognized in accounting for gift cards as presented in the consolidated statements of operations.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S11	The Company will be recognizing the estimated breakage of gift cards over the pattern of redemption of the gift cards.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S12	Prior to adopting the ASU, the Company recognized gift card breakage when the likelihood of redemption became remote.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S13	The Company will also recognize direct-mail advertising costs as expense as incurred.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S14	Prior to adopting the ASU, the Company capitalized these costs which were expensed over the period of benefit.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S15	Additionally, the Company will recognize contract assets for the carrying amount of product expected to be returned and for costs to obtain a contract if the contract is more than one year.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S16	The Company will expense as incurred costs to obtain a contract if the contract is less than one year.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S17	Product expected to be returned was presented as a reduction of the related reserve for returns prior to adopting the ASU.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S18	The Company expects the cumulative impact of adopting the ASU on January 1, 2018 to be an increase in stockholders equity of approximately $1,500.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S19	The Company has identified and is implementing changes to its accounting policies, practices and controls to support the ASU.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P46_S20	The Company is continuing its assessment of potential changes to its disclosures under the ASU.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P47_S0	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P48_S0	An entity using an inventory method other than last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P48_S1	The new guidance clarifies that net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P48_S2	The Company adopted this new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017 and it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P49_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which eliminates the previous requirement to present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P49_S1	Instead, entities are required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a statement of financial position.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P49_S2	The Company adopted this new accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017, which resulted in a reclassification of $1,642 at December 31, 2016 from current deferred income taxes to non-current deferred income taxes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P50_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors).
1096376_18_ITEM15_P50_S1	The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P50_S2	This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P50_S3	A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P50_S4	This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P51_S0	currently believes the most significant changes will be related to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Company s balance sheet for operating leases.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P52_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P52_S1	The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2017 and recognized an excess tax benefit from share-based compensation of $5,491 for the year ended December 31, 2017 within income tax expense on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as opposed to being recognized in additional paid-in capital under previous accounting guidance.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P52_S2	The amounts recognized in additional paid-in capital were $2,936 and $2,750 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P52_S3	In addition, the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation are now classified as operating cash flows on the consolidated statement of cash flows instead of being separately stated in the financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P52_S4	The prior periods have not been restated.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P52_S5	The Company has elected to continue to estimate expected forfeitures.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies and provides guidance on eight cash flow classification issues and is intended to reduce existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S1	This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S2	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S3	The adoption of this new accounting standard will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S4	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards require an entity to apply modification accounting.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S5	This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S6	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P53_S7	The adoption of this new accounting standard will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P54_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and operating expenses during the reporting period.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P54_S1	Actual results could differ from these estimates .
1096376_18_ITEM15_P55_S0	CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS At December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of the following:

1096376_18_ITEM15_P57_S0	A three-tier fair value hierarchy has been established by the FASB to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P58_S0	Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P58_S1	Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P58_S2	Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P59_S0	The fair values of the Company s Level 1 instruments are based on quoted prices in active exchange markets for identical assets.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P59_S1	The Company had no Level 2 or 3 instruments at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P63_S0	6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS On December 17, 2015, the Company acquired the South Beach Diet ( SBD ) brand for a cash payment of $15,000.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P63_S1	The acquisition was financed with existing cash.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P64_S0	The Company developed the South Beach Diet meal programs, products, and services in 2016 and launched a structured meal delivery weight-loss program as a distinct brand in 2017.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P64_S1	The acquisition provides consumers with additional choices and enables the Company the ability to capture a greater share of the commercial weight los s market as it further leverages its expertise in product development, marketing, ecommerce, supply chain logistics and retail.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P65_S0	The allocation of the purchase price was to the SBD trade name and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P66_S0	The fair value measurement method used to measure the assets acquired utilized a number of significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 assumptions.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P66_S1	These assumptions included, among others, projections of the acquired businesses future operating results, the implied fair value of assets using an income approach by preparing a discounted cash flow analysis and other subjective assumptions.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P67_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s identifiable intangible assets:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P68_S0	Amortization expense for intangible assets was $1,000 for both 2017 and 2016.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P70_S0	On November 6, 2015, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides for a $50,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility ) with a lender.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P70_S1	The Credit Facility can be drawn upon through November 6, 2020, at which time all amounts must be repaid.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P70_S2	There were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016 under the Credit Facility.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P71_S0	The Credit Facility provides for interest at either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, in each case plus an applicable margin.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P71_S1	The base rate will be the highest of (i) the Administrative Agent s prime rate, (ii) 0.50% above the Federal Funds Rate and (iii) the LIBOR rate for deposits in dollars for a one-month interest period as determined three business days prior to such date, plus 1.50%.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P71_S2	The LIBOR rate is equal to the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for the relevant term.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P71_S3	The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the Company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and ranges from 0.00-0.50% per year for base rate loans and from 1.25-1.75% per year for LIBOR rate loans.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P72_S0	The Company pays an unused line fee.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P72_S1	The unused line fee is 0.25% of the total available credit.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P83_S0	On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ).
1096376_18_ITEM15_P83_S1	The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P83_S2	Other changes include the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017 as well as, prospective changes beginning in 2018 including additional limitations on executive compensation.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P84_S0	Income tax expense consists of the following:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P85_S0	A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company s effective tax rate is as follows:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P86_S0	The change in the effective tax rate from 2016 to 2017 was due primarily to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 as of January 1, 2017 partially offset by a charge recorded to write-down the net deferred asset due to the enactment of the Tax Act.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P86_S1	The Company recognized an excess tax benefit from share-based compensation of $5,491 in the year ended December 31, 2017 within income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations rather than as additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under previous accounting guidance.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P86_S2	This benefit was partially offset by a charge of $836 to write-down the net deferred tax asset to reflect the reduction of the future federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P87_S0	The significant items comprising the Company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P88_S0	At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27,948 and $28,038, respectively, for state tax purposes.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P88_S1	For state tax purposes, there is a limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized in a given year to offset state taxable income.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P88_S2	The net operating losses will begin to expire in 2025.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P89_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Company had a valuation allowance of $800 recorded against its deferred tax asset generated for charitable contributions.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P89_S1	The Company recorded the valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount it expected was more likely than not to be realized due to the short carryforward period for this temporary difference.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P89_S2	In 2015, the Company reduced the valuation allowance to zero due to the expiration of certain charitable contribution carryovers.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P89_S3	At December 31, 2016, there was no valuation allowance.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P89_S4	At December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $817 as certain state net operating loss carryforwards might not be realized due to changes in tax legislation.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P89_S5	Based on the projected level of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the remaining net deferred tax assets.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P90_S0	An analysis of the activity of the valuation allowance is as follows:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P91_S0	The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $131, $168 and $272, respectively, which is included as a reduction of deferred income taxes in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P91_S1	The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate is approximately $103, $109 and $177 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P93_S2	The Company does not believe that that there will be any material changes to unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P93_S3	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of the total unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P94_S0	Equity Incentive Plans The Company has three equity incentive plans: the 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Second Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the Equity Incentive Plans ).

1096376_18_ITEM15_P94_S3	The 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the Second Amended and Restated 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorize up to 1,000, 5,600 and 7,400 shares of common stock, respectively, for issuance.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P94_S5	Under each of the plans, the Board s Compensation Committee determines the term of each award, but no award can be exercisable more than 10 years from the date the award is granted.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P94_S6	The stock options issued under the Equity Incentive Plans generally expire seven years from the grant date.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P94_S7	The Compensation Committee also determines the vesting provisions of all awards and the exercise price per share of stock options issued under the plans, which is the fair value at date of grant.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P94_S8	Awards issued to employees generally vest over terms ranging from two to four years.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P94_S9	The following table summarizes the Company s stock option activity for 2015, 2016 and 2017:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P95_S0	The Company recorded compensation expense of $884, $1,072 and $647, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for stock option awards.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P95_S2	The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted in 2016 and 2015 was $5.99 and $5.18, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P95_S3	The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $8,660, $5,727 and $5,520, respectively.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P96_S0	The fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P97_S0	In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company authorized the issuance of 14, 27 and 22 fully vested shares of common stock, respectively, as compensation to the Board of Directors resulting in compensation expense of $700, $700 and $509, respectively.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P98_S1	The fair value is equal to the market price of th e Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P99_S0	Expense for restricted stock is amortized ratably over the vesting period.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P99_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for 2015, 2016 and 2017:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P100_S0	Additionally, the Company grants performance-based restricted stock units.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P100_S1	The performance-based units have performance conditions and service-based vesting conditions.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P100_S2	Each vesting tranche is treated as an individual award and the compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each tranche.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P100_S3	The requisite service period is a combination of the performance period and the subsequent vesting period based on continued service.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P100_S4	The level of achievement of such goals may cause the actual amount of units that ultimately vest to range from 0% to 200% of the original units granted.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P101_S0	The Company recognizes expense ratably over the vesting period for performance-based restricted stock units when it is probable that the performance criteria specified will be achieved.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P102_S0	The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P102_S1	The following table summarizes the restricted stock unit activity for 2015, 2016 and 2017:
1096376_18_ITEM15_P103_S0	The Company recorded compensation expense of $9,319, $5,198 and $4,312 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P103_S1	As of December 31, 2017, the Company expects 228 shares of restricted stock and 227 restricted stock units to vest.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P104_S0	As of December 31, 2017, there was $7,664 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensatio n arrangements, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1 year.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P104_S1	The total unrecognized compensation expense will be fully charged to expense through the first quarter of 2020.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P105_S0	The Company maintains a qualified tax deferred defined contribution retirement plan (the Plan ).
1096376_18_ITEM15_P105_S1	Under the provisions of the Plan, substantially all employees meeting minimum age and service requirements are entitled to contribute on a before and after-tax basis a certain percentage of their compensation.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P105_S2	The Company matched 100% of employees first 3% contribution and 50% of the employees next 2% contribution.

1096376_18_ITEM15_P107_S0	The sum of the quarterly basic and diluted per share amounts may not equal amounts reported for the year.
1096376_18_ITEM15_P107_S1	This is due to the effects of rounding and changes in weighted average shares outstanding for each period.
